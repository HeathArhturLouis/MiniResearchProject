 This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class.  Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did.  I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it.  I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics 
 Because I could find the Baseball America Handbook and having seen one of my classmates with it, I decided to acquire it. Although it is not a completely waste, it is disappointing.  First of all, stats like wins, saves etc. are not listed. I think it is important to have some idea of the basic statistics. Secondly, I do not like the organization of players. They list players who have changed teams on their old teams, keep pitchers and position players separate which can be hard to follow at times.  My biggest complaint though is the fact that they seem convinced that they know everything and that they are funny. As a result, there are quite a few snarky comments when describing players like Alejandro Machado (Nationals) that is not even close to informative and their attacks on Pat Gillick and Jim Bowden are nothing short of vicious.  For a prospect handbook, this is disappointing 
 LP Vietnam is an O.K. book if you just want to know how to get around, basic accomodations, etc.  There are some good information in the book, but not enough.    If you are interested in knowing about modern Vietnam, you are much much better off reading Catfish and Mandala by Andrew Pham and Shadows and Wind by Robert Templer.   These two authors did an extraordinary job of describing what is happening in Vietnam right now.   I am very disappointed at the guide books to Vietnam such as Lonely Planet, Rough Guides, Fodor's etc.   Should they be unbiased sources who actually tell the readers the stories behind the sights?   Nope!  they didn't do the job that well.  Instead they rely too much on the information which is given by the government propaganda machine which is totally fabricated.   For example, on page 467 of the Lonely Planet Vietnam book, the story about the One Pillar Pagoda is mentioned that it was destroyed by the French before they left Hanoi.  Guess what?   The French didn't destroy it, it was the Communists themselves who destroyed it at the time because it was described as a remain of a feudalistic, decadent, reactionary past (a sort of Cultural revolution that is copied from China).   It was rebuilt not because Hanoi suddenly had a change of heart to treasure the national treasures.   It was rebuilt because of the tourists' money.   What a disappointment for these supposedly guide books that really mislead the readers 
 Once again it seems another jazz books of regurgitated titdbits has forgotten most of the woman in jazz. True Ella, Sarah, Billie, Carmen and the likes are here -- but for the most part this is a good ol' boys jazz review book. Was also VERY disappointed to note that their selected discography hasn't changed much since the last editio 
 Although I agree with the premise that stress can and does cause physical pain and many chronic ailments, there are many of us out there with serious debilitating back problems, that can not be just "willed away" or minimized by meditation and breathing exercises.  A small chapter at the end of the book owned up to some of the serious back problems that are, in fact, serious and would need special treatment sometimes (rarely) even surgery.  I have a feeling this was inserted as almost an afterthought to prevent any lawsuits from anyone believing you can ignore your serious back problems and get right back to your previous normal life.  Unfortunately that's not the case for many people out there who aren't just suffering from muscle spasms and stress 
 except not as good.  You'd have to be a HUGE Dekker fan to get into this book.  Not suspenseful.  It's as cliched as it is confusing, which is quite an accomplishment 
 My brother hated this book and I don't think it is very good either. Kids should learn from their parents about the body and not from a book. I recommend this book to very very very little kids 
 This is the biggest pile of stinky cheese from the eighties ever it is just horrible   don't waste your time or money   instead go to mac D and geta double cheeseburger 
 The back cover to this book was intriguing, and captured me immediately. The writing, however, was so plodding, so inconsistent, and so non-sequential that it was painful to get through to the end. This is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day.  I can't believe that this book made it past the editors.  In one paragraph Jon Katz tells how Rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet, and in the next he says that Rose is too young to herd sheep.  In one paragraph he can't live without his wife, she gives his very existence meaning, and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to...what was it again?  Oh, right, herd sheep!  At one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he can't connect to and finally gives away.  And then can't stop visiting, even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog. And why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys - there's a reason, Jon!  If you care at all about literarure, stay away from this book 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 Love Michael Buble, but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience.  Parts of Michael's head was cut off, and then; sometimes, his whole head was cut off.  Most of the time, the camera man didn't expect where Michael was going to move to and you'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture.  I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert.  That this was just home made videos.  This was definitely not worth $20.  If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble's Caught in the Act.  Caught in the Act was worth the $20 bucks.  You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael's movements, and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me's DVD.  Also, the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better.  Now, I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD's and had the word enhanced after it.  The DVD that I received was not enhanced.  Anyways, skip this one, and get "Caught in the Act" instead 
 This book had a lot of hype. The book was not what I expected. This is really more of how to triathlon book than anything else.The cancer and the food changes are mentioned but exercise is really the main focus. I think the regular reader would definitely have trouble relating to this book 
 I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below.  I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible.  This book is just so boring, no spunk or humor; it just fell flat.  I am also finding the Jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days...aren't there any other ethnic groups to be written about 
 ...but I listen to them even less!  I bought this album at random a few years ago.  My first impression after I bought it was "mediocre British band".  I've listened to it a couple times since then, the most recent today, and my impression hasn't changed.  If it weren't for the fact that Brian Eno contributed to this album I'd probably give it one star 
 This is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel I've ever seen.  The novel was an early work by Jane Austen (published posthumously) so it's not as well crafted as later works.  Despite the novel's weaknesses, however, even this video production does not do it justice.  The heroine looks like she's on heroin, Maj. Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in "All Creatures Great and Small") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff.  I can't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one I chose or whether there was no other choice.  The only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships--before I read the book.  As they say, "the book was better," and in this case, the old saying couldn't be more true 
 I read the reviews and everyone said this was a great piece of work. Well I agree that it was a peice of something but I won't go into that. This album is nothing but noise. There is no rythum to the album what-so-ever. It sounds like a band that just gets together and each person does thier own thing and records it. Absolutely horrible in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and get something like Full Blown Chaos. As for this album, save your money 
 teenage vegans and vegetarians aren't stupid people. if i had read this befor i had gone vegan, i probably wouldn't have... there are so many other great books out there with better information. try anne marie colbin's "food and healing.&quot 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 Buy one of the other versions with special features. This is the older, first-generation DVD with NO features. Nothing. Plus, this is a flipper disc!  A great movie worth owning.. just not this edition 
 I have enjoyed Thor's novels in the past.  "Takedown" is a major 'let down'!  The NYC terrorist plot is at best ill developed.  The characters throughout the book are very superficial and relative to the plot are depicted (on purpose or by accident) to be so inept I grew impatient with this book.  Spontaneous responses of government agencies, at the city level (e.g. NYPD, FDNY) during a NYC terror incident, are ridiculously absent on all fronts except to interfere with the central character Harvath.  The book is simply not realistic and the contradictions on US intelligence of terrorist activities are unbelievable (i.e. US knowledge of key terrorists permitting their capture, but no knowledge of the impending major NYC terrorist attack!).  And the ability of a very small group of terrorists to overcome 'deep security' NYC facilities so easily was a credibility distraction.  Sadly, the 106 'chapters' seem to be more of an outline for a really good novel that unfortunately when published was only half developed 
 All I got was some very average Beethoven performances from Leonard Bernstein, a conductor usually renowned for his extrovert, fascinating approach to various music but who so misses the mark with this dull cycle of the greatest symphonies of all time. One of the main problems is possibly the fact that Bernstein chose to record this cycle, ( his 2nd cycle of Beethoven symphonies ), with the Vienna Philharmonic. His earlier one was with the New York Philharmonic and that was a lot more youthful and vigorous. These Vienna versions are much more mellow and relaxed, I love the Vienna Philharmonic but they've played this music to death and I don't think they can really be inspired, full-throttle like a younger, less tradition ingrained orchestra. And to add insult to injury, Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic was always much superior in these years in terms of virtuosity, finesse, power and everything you need to feel the impact of Beethoven.  Still, the Vienna Philharmonic is one of the finest orchestras in the world and it leaves it up to the conductor to truly inspire them. This is where Bernstein fails, every single one of these symphonies is safe, lackluster and middle of the road. Let's take a quick, one by one analysis of the works.  Symphony 1 is done with charm and grace, Bernstein obviously enjoying the mood but I miss the sprint and attack that Karajan brings to this music. Symphony 2 is where Bernstein truly shines, he puts in plenty of power and concentration throughtout and the slow movement, the larghetto, is gorgeous. All in all, a success. Symphony 3, the Eroica is where the trouble starts. It's boring, it's deflated, it's dull compared to Bernstein's earlier New York version and Bernstein typically falls flat on his face when compared to Karajan or Klemperer in the Eroica. The funeral march by Bernstein can put you to sleep, where is the emotional gravity that Karajan brings to it in his devastating digital record? Symphony 4 is good but not great, a general run through with a few interesting touches. Symphony 5 is a dismal failure, the famous first movement is the worst I've ever heard. It's obscenely slow, 8 minutes, 38 seconds! Compare that to most versions which average like 7 minutes, 20 seconds. The rest of the symphony is nothing special but at least better than the atrocious first movement. The Pastoral symphony is well played but isn't in the league with Karl Bohm or Vladimir Ashkenazy. Symphony 7 is one of the best performances of the Bernstein cycle, with lots of energy and drive. Symphony 8 is humorous and lively, not massive like Karajan, but that's ok.   Finally, Symphony number 9 is where you should hear true fireworks from Bernstein, instead you get your typical run through as if this was some background music. The choral finale especially is a total let down compared to Solti's magnificient 1972 version or Karajan's 1977 recording. I hope Bernstein's later performance for the coming down of the Berlin Wall is not as routine as what I hear here. I have yet to hear that famous record.  All Beethoven symphonic cycles are eventually disappointing because no one conductor can approach perfection in every one of these works. Bernstein succeds in symphonies 2 and 7 in this set, but that's really it, the rest are average or worse. Karajan's early 1960's cycle is the one to go for if you desperately need a complete set by one conductor. It's not perfect but the most satisfactory available.  For individual symphonies, try Karajan in symphony 1, Karajan, Szell or Bernstein in symphony 2. For the Eroica, Karajan's digital version or Klemperer's 1961, Szell and Furtwangler are also great. Symphony 4 goes to either Szell or Karajan, Symphony 5 to Giulini, Furtwangler, Karajan and Kleiber. The Pastoral goes to Bohm and Ashkenazy or Bruno Walter. The 7th goes to God knows who, I haven't found a perfect Seventh, yet! Try Thielemann, Furtwangler or Bernstein. Go with Karajan's digital version for the 8th symphony. Last but not least, Solti, 1972 for the the Choral Symphony, as well as Karajan, 62, 77 and Furtwangler, 51, 42, all great.  Man, that sounds like a lot, but that's Beethoven for you. You can't ever find the perfect interpretation, because they simply don't exist 
 On the positive side this book was sometimes amusing. The story idea of two thirteen-year-old's experimentation with sex and resulting in a pregnant seventh grader was promising though poorly executed. None of the main characters are believable, not the narrator, Sam, not his girlfriend Maurey, and not his mother Lydia. The motivations and thought patterns of the adolescents especially lacked any power to convey belief. This novel should probably have stayed in the form of Mr. Sandlin's puerile fantasies, from which it sprung 
 I wanted to enjoy "To Repel Ghosts" so much. I have seen many of Jean Michel basquiats paintings and drawings. He was as poetic visually as he was when writing his thoughts down. Kevin Youngs book suffers because he seems to want to live through Basquiats words...but that is all that they seem to be is words...without soul!!! 
 I used to be an *N Sync fan back in the day, not a fanatic but just a fan of their music. Once this CD came out I thought about possibly buying it til I heard most of it at a record store and I was ashamed to have liked their music. The song "Pop" isn't even that good, but needless to say that was their only good song on that CD. It is best to just save your money. Justin is doing better without the guys 
 I saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on HBO and was interested enough to purchase the DVD.  Too bad I didn't watch the movie first when it was free!  James Earl Jone's acting abilities were wasted on this movie, and I won't comment on the others. I'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayed in this film.  Sorry I can't be more complimentary, but..... 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I saw them at the Fillmore E. twice.  I loved their albums.  Bless Its Pointed etc. incredibly exciting.  This album I had to take off the CD player.  Not singing but caterwauling, the musicians are non-musical as well. A total embarrassment.  They should never have released it 
 This straightener has been one of the worst I have ever used. It didn't straighten at all. I had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight. It did not stay straight either.<br /> WASTE OF MONEY!!! DON'T BUY 
 Gosh, I am almost speechless. Flanagan receives two stars for her fine way with words. Had she written a coherent and believable book that had a thesis backed by the facts of either her life or anyone's life, I would have been pleased to give her at least four stars. It wasn't so much that I don't agree with what she says, but rather that I am not sure what she said. Of course, that does make a reasoned discussion about her viewpoint rather problematic for a reviewer...  Flanagan entertains with witty and irreverent tweaks to the strangely conflicted ways of middle and upper middle class mothers. She hits clever and common notes as she rifts about her childhood and her own life as a mother. The problem is that I don't get it. And, as a reader, it's always nice if the reader can say, "oh, yes, I see what you mean," or "I don't agree with you." With Flanagan's book, her thoughts were so muddy (or must I apologize for being simply a dense reader?)that I am left...yes, I said it before. But, it bears repeating:  speechless -- almost.  So, to review the book I can only guess at a fair summary. But, here is what I think Flanagan said: Feminists were silly and clearly wrong. I am a new generation mother.  I am not sure I like what that is, but in order to work (like I want to do) and be a mother (like my mother was) I spend many thousands of dollars annually on nannies, housekeepers, fine preschools to help me.  I think I might like to stay at home and be like my mother, but I am not going to do that. We even hire help to wash the vomit laden linens in the aftermath of an ill child at our house.  No one should expect a man to do these things, because it's pretty clear that they simply are unable to rise to adequate performance of such demanding tasks. And, I am not going to do these things because I am miserable at such tasks and don't really want to do them enough to become competent myself.  Flanagan ends up being a champion for no one. Come to think of it, perhaps it does reflect perfectly the state of women/family issues in America today...messy, chaotic, and conflicted. It's too bad Flanagan can't be more than a very self-absorbed observer with a quite competent way with words.    Flanagan has hired help and can pass these battlefield tasks on to her lackies (oh, she doesn't need to feel guilty here because she pays her social security and withholding on these hirelings!. This fact will surely make her diatribe  so much more credible to those lower income families where both parents really have to work for their literal and figurative bread...families where mom has no housekeeping and nanny options...families where it is either her or him swabbing the decks.  I can only assume that Flanagan would suggest that these mothers simply work all day and night because she's already told us several times about their inherent and gender-wide imcompetence at the things women do so deftly. Flanagan recalls fondly that her mother engaged in household work in the while her father read the paper and seems to view this with nostalgia to the good (and past) family times. So, the reader is left to assume that the scrambling mother who has no choice but to work outside the home must continue to work in the evenings while "her man" reads the paper. What a picture of family bliss!   Oh, Betty and Gloria...I know we have a ways to go, but could we at least ask for someone to make an anti-feminist argument that comes makes a bit of sense for today's world, because we sure can't rely upon Flanagan's bemused and rather pleasant ramblings to help us out much 
 This book is impossible, complicated, and confusing. Good luck to anyone who tries to figure it out.  Zizek careens through film history, haphazardly - and sometimes carefully - appropriating examples in order to make various 'post-modern' and Lacanian points. It almost seems like parody, but ... it's not 
 If this is your first beading book you might find useful information here. If you've been beading for some time this book offers nothing, the projects are way too simple, more for kids than adults. It feels that the author is only starting with beading herself, she has not learned enough to teach others. There are so much better beading books out there, don't waste your money on this 
 Please do your self a favor and avoid this series like the plague.  When I start a series, and I've been inthis genre for years, I finsih it.  This is the first one I really wanted to quit.  I really beieive the author fills the books with mindless babble just to fill 800 pages and sell something.  Book 10 is the worst of a really bad series.  Read the dictionary, it has more life

 Simply more of Susan Estrich's typical left wing non-sense.  This just shows that the pundits, as well as their Democratic masters haven't got even the slightest bit of grounding in reality and are definitely out of touch with most Americans.  Ann Coulter, in all the books and articles she has written, has never once had to retract a single fact due to inaccuracy.  She does here research and does it well.  Miss Estrich will be retracting this dribble for a long time to come.  That is, if there is any honesty left in her 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 I have read a few things by Lattimore, and while he is touted as the most accurate translator of Greek literature, I find him increadibly difficult to read. His sentences sometimes make no sense at all.  English is a language that depends upon syntax and the order of words in a sentence; Greek is not this way, it is a language with myriad declensions and conjugations, effectively allowing its poets to manipulate a sentence's word order.  Lattimore may simply be too accurate to the Greek originals, because the word order--translated so precisely--simply does not fit well in the English. I recommend Fagles, who is an amazing translator; and while he is accurate, he also understands the limitations of translating the Greek to English. His sentences are fluid and capture the life of the translation. For Aeschylus, I also recommend Philip Vellacott. Check out Fagles, then check out Vellacott. But please forego the Lattimore translations, unless you really want to understand just the sort of impact a bad translation can have. 
 Must have firewire AC wall charger and/or six-pin firewire on computer to charge this unit.  I have neither.   Also found 30g vidpod didn't fit properly in plastic sleeves and the dock connector seemed to want to unseat it as well. Returned unit to shop and purchased Belkin 4 x AA battery unit with suction cups.  Much better.  You can use rechargeable batteries or simply buy them when needed 
 I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.    The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.     The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)  Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.    This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue 
 I was very disappointed in the content of the book. Not only were the styles out of date but the construction of the curtains was anything but professional. I am the owner of an upscale drapery workroom and I am always looking for books with great ideas, there were none in this book and frankly if I constructed any of my curtains in the manner in which she describes they would be returned by the designer and the client because of the  poor quality 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either.  The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions.  Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it.  Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous.  I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this 
 i really like douglas coupland, but i didn't like this novel it is the only one though the rest are all 4 or 5 stars 
 This movie was NOT good at all. Other than it has beautiful people with real nice bodies,everything else is a waste of money and time 
 It is amazing someone would spend so much time to translate a text like this only to not translate it in it's entirety.  I have seen this before with Conze's translations of Buddhist texts which are equally appalling.  This being a ancient religious text, it has repetition.  But it is there for a reason. One, often an important point is repeated so that you remember it.  Two, with Buddhist texts, many of them are meant to be a meditation, the repetition is part of that.  Third it is a poetic device.  But again when you buy a translation of a text don't you expect to get the WHOLE text and not have it edited at whim by the translator.  The Sutras are the equivalent of the Bible in Buddhism.  Wouldn't you think something is wrong if every time a translation of the Bible repeated itself (as the synoptic gospels do) that you just got a note instead of the actual text.  I can't believe Wisdom even published it, no one would publish a bible that way.  Worse still, Walshe doesn't note the majority of the items he leaves out but just gives you a ... to indicted he didn't feel the point was important enough to translate.  And these often come a point where it really interferes with the reading of the text.  I want my money back 
 Written by a failed spiritual seeker turned anti-spiritual polemical secularist, this book lacks the substance and insight possessed by a vaguely similar but nevertheless far superior work of disenchantment, Jeffrey Masson's *My Father's Guru*.  Having spent three years attempting without success to follow the Sufi path, Ibn al-Rawandi in this book returns to Sufism but weakly flails about in his efforts to exact from it his revenge.  Ultimately his message is that if you are a rationalist and do not believe in spiritual transformation, do not get involved in Sufism.  Sound advice--but isn't this obvious?!  The bottom line, though, is that a good piece of yellow journalism should at least be a juicy and engaging read.  Sadly, this work is by and large flat.  So if you want a book on spiritual disenchantment, read Masson. If you want something on Sufism, read anything but Ibn al-Rawandi 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 I picked up this book, having thoroughly enjoyed the last 2 editions and was greatly disappointed by the story selection this year.  In the past the selections have all had only one thing in common: they are some of the best pieces of "writing" in the past year.   This year there seems to be a theme of nothing but depression.  Story after story seems to be nothing but how bad life is and how there is nothing you can do to get around it.  Reading this book is akin to watching French films all day then calling your mom and asking her "whats wrong?".  The light at the end of the tunnel is a hilarious story from Sedaris about a rousing night of strip poker.  Very funny stuff and is just about the only reason I give this book 2 stars.  
 I am a huge fan of the CARS from day one. I tried to like this but can't I was ready to hit the concert too. I just can't. (Easton busted his collar bone so tour cancelled)Yeah Easton is an excellent guitar player. Hawkes too great keyboards. But missing the other 3 guys it just isn't the CARS. The vocals no less. They can be a cover band but no more. Ben Orr had a voice that can not be copied. God rest his soul. Ric is an excellent songwriter. The band was formed by Ocasek and ORR. When Ben died it really was the end. The thought that these guys would even try is very sad. It is like seeing the Beach Boys today. They are not what they once were. 
 I have never read this author before and probably won't again. I found the story hard to follow from the beginning and if you are an animal lover you probably will be as repulsed as I was in the sequence about "skinning the cat down to his whiskers and watching him stagger around."  This book is going in the trash literally and I didn't care to read any further than the cat episode which was quite early on 
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 This with a doubt one of the worst can openers I've ever owned!! I bought it because it is attractive and will accept tall cans. It is attractive, but not very functional. It is so very difficult to get the can positioned just right, so it will open, that it takes 5 or 6 tries just to get it to work. The "lid catcher" blocks your view of the mechanism so it's almost impossible to position the can properly. In addition when removing the can, the cutting arm mechanism slides off the opener most of the time.  Don't but this poorly designed product!! 
 THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.   This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.  Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).   By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.  Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.  Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original.  
 As a resident who has lived in Yuma, Arizona for the past nine years and read the daily paper and watched the nightly news giving scant details about one or two bodies found here or there, presumed to be those of "illegals" -- Urrea brings to the reader the faces and lives of the human beings behind the numbers.  I often think of the deceased that are briefly mentioned in these news blurbs and wonder where they came from, whom they have left behind and what dreams of theirs did the desert kill?  And is the desert what really killed them?  Or was it some errant Border Patrol agent or a frustrated and pissed off Minuteman?  Just what are they so pissed about, anyhow?   Regarding the immigrants and their motivations for leaving their beloved behind for the north, Urrea certainly answered some of my questions.  No, America, they are not all criminals, drug runners or people out to get your top jobs!  They just want to make enough to feed their families and if they're lucky, save enough to buy a little building material for a house or to start up a small business.  I have yet to hear any of my friends or acquaintances get excited about applying for jobs in agriculture or plucking chickens!   This book should be recommended reading for our government leaders, the INS, and ALL law enforcement agencies - they might just be able to figure out a plan for immigration reform!  Just be sure to read the interview of Mr. Urrea in the Reading Group Guide at the end of the book -- the numbers (profits) will amaze you.  As this book painfully demonstrates, fences are not going to do anything but make death in the desert an even more certain fate for crossers.   Thank you, Mr. Urrea, for giving the world a clear and concise picture of what is really going on in our corner of the country and our part of the globe, for that matter.  As I drive along I-8 going to either San Diego or Phoenix and offer my usual prayer for those who have died so close by, I can promise that the names of Edgar, Abraham, Jose and Reymundo will not be forgotten.  I will even have a prayer for Mendez.      
 I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between "wicca" and "witchcraft".  Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to "chopping" of source materials. This is a waste of money 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 This book is one that people interested in immigration policy should read.  Borjas relentlessly applies economic theory to the question of immigration, rarely pausing to think about whether he's getting a clear picture or not.  It was a fairly ground-breaking attempt to look at immigration from an economic perspective and has quite a lot of useful information.  That said, it also is a frustrating book and one that has some pretty significant flaws that should be kept in mind.  Here are a few examples.  Borjas discounts the idea that discrimination is a significant factor in the poor labor market performance of certain immigrants with no more argument than a reference to the work of Gary Becker and the claim that Becker had shown that there is no such thing as workplace discrimination.  Becker, of course, has shown no such thing but had merely provided an a prior argument which was, unfortunately, not born out by empirical enquiry.  This part of Borjas's book, then, is completely unsupported.  Borjas regularly uses operational definitions of terms (as do most economists) but without realizing how this distorts the picture and limits the inferences that can be drawn from the data.  So, he repeatedly claims that new waves of immigrants are less skilled than older immigrants, but what he means by this is just that they do less well in the labor market than did older immigrants.  This is a very unusual definition, to say the least, and makes his claims that we should try to recruit more skilled immigrants hard to understand since, on his account, this can only mean that we should recruit more immigrants who will do well in our labor markets.  He gives no advice on how to do this, nor on what this would mean as a policy proposal.  ("Skilled", on his account, does not and cannot mean "highly trained" or "highly educated".)  So, while it may well be true the more recent immigrants are less skilled than older waves, Borjas's use of an operational definition of "skilled" makes his analysis of little use.  Similarly Borjas makes a bizarre claim about how the admission of "less skilled" immigrants has imposed a loss on the US economy.  This is a bizarre claim since in order to make it he has to imagine that we might have recruited the same number of "skilled" (in his operationally defined sense) immigrants as we did "unskilled" ones in the same time period.  He then takes the difference in GDP from the real world and his totally imaginary and probably impossible one and calls this a "loss".  This is a loss only in a very funny sense- the same way in which you have a loss of a million dollars when you don't pick the right numbers on the lottery, even if you in fact won 5 dollars and so are four dollars ahead of where you were before.  Since there is no reason at all to think we could have attracted this number of "skilled" workers this cannot even realistically be called a lost opportunity.  Borjas notes this very briefly in a foot-note, but doesn't seem to notice that it makes much of his analysis in that section of the book nonsense.  There are many more examples of similar problems.  So, over all, the book is worth reading both for the useful parts, those which discuss various ways in which immigration has changed over time and how immigrants impact the economy, it has enough significant methedological flaws that it cannot be strongly recommended 
 I couldn't really finish this book, although it was interesting as history of religion it was pretty dry 
 Well, this CD is okay but unfortunately the two tunes that they released on the radio are probably the best on the CD 
 As the other reviewer stated, the seal appears to be faulty on this, and it stopped working almost straight away.  I have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 David Fincher's Seven was undoubtadly one of the most unnerving mainstream films of recent memory, and after hearing the great, moody music from the film, I tracked down the soundtrack and was very disappointed.  First off, Howard Shore's orchestral scores are more than worth hearing and capture the depressed feel of the film, but the remix of "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails (which played during the opening credits) and David Bowie's "The Heart's Filthy Lesson" (which played during the closing credits) are not present here, which is very disheartening.  Gravity Kills' one time hit "Guilty" is here, but other than that there isn't anything else worth hearing.  If your a fan of the film and love the two songs I listed above, this is what to do.  For the remix of "Closer" is available on the "Closer to God" CD single, and Bowie's song can be found on his "Outside" album.  If your looking to buy this soundtrack for one or both those songs, beware, they are not here 
 This is a book that has no reason to be.   The author appears to have two primary objectives, viz.,to exhibit how clever he is and, secondly,how awful a man and writer Orwell was.  The author is not clever;he is repetitious and snide in a schoolboy boastful manner. He is incredibly careless as a writer and editor, appears ignorant of basic grammar and rules of punctuation and mistakes coyness for principle.The reader may open the book at random for examples of these failures.  His knowledge of history one may measure by his statement that Chamberlin flew to Berlin in 1938. Again, the curious reader can find errors of this sort almost at random. Just open the book--if you must.  The more serious criticism of the book is that it is entirely a tendentious assassination of reputation. The argument of the book the author recapitulates in a chapter three quaters through, entitled "The Case Against".This apparently is for the slow learners who may have missed Taylor's derogatory points liberally supplied throughout the previous three hundred pages. In two pages and a paragraph, the author releases the proverbial cat;one understands why this text appears so late in the book. Had the author a proper sense of honest intellectual protocal, he would have announced in an introduction his purpose. So silly this is,no reader would have bothered with the book.  A  ploy Taylor favors is to  set forth alternative and always invidious explanations for Orwell's words and actions.If no one is at hand to quote, Taylor sets up a straw dog built from his own ever so sensitive reading, and precedes to demolish it.He makes no attempt at balance.He is utterly unpersuasive because he works so hard at being so unfair. As a deflator, he lacks subtley. One can imagine how little Orwell would have respected Taylor and how little he would have cared.   This is a mean spirited, unconvincing, and finally, unnecessary production.  The reader caring to read about Orwell has many fine alternatives, not the least meritorious of which is the Bowker life, published the same year as Taylor's spam of a study. 
 First of all, i wasn't sent out here by the "Illuminati," i couldn't tell you if they really exist or not.  But I will tell you that Jim Keith died because he broke his knee and didn't go to the hospital when it happened, he died of a blood clot during surgery.  (...)  Persoanlly, I believe that a few of the things Keith has brought up in this book are correct.  I'm sure there is CIA experimenting and other crooked things going on, and i think microchip implants are a bigger threat than people realize.  But that does not mean that this should be looked at as a gospel 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 These DVDs continue to be bitter disappointments. They crop the image, they only put 3 on a CD, and they release them sporadically. This is the last one I will ever buy - I just got a DVD burner and I'll burn new episodes. For old episodes, just head over to ebay, there are some wonderfully produced bootleg sets out there. I just dropped $70 for seasons 1&2 - gorgeous case, menus, high quality widescreen, and even bonus features. It could have been Time-Warner's $70, but they continue to be stupid and greedy about their DVD sets 
 After publishing the best introduction to home brewing Papazian released this unenlightening tome.  His snappy style, so essential in his first book, sounds dull and contrived.  One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc.  This information could have been presented in a two page spread.    Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique.  The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout.  If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.'  Papazian's  book will most likely be a complete disappointment 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I personally am not happy at all with this item, very small not the same as pictured ( the one I got is bright yellow, really flimsy ) don't think it'll last very long. I'll keep it, not worth sending back, my Corgi seems to like it ~ but its a bit small even for her, I think it's life will be short. (not well made 
 There are a number of good books about quantum computing around.  Unfortunately, because it has a number of errors, and because the explanations are not always clear, this is not one of them.  I know somebody who, after reading this book's section on superdense coding and teleportation, ended up more confused than he started out.  This is because not only is teleportation presented using a forest of bewildering 8x8 matrices (correct, but only useful if this is explained well), but the words accompanying these matrices are actually wrong.  For example in superdense coding Alice is said to send Bob a quantum bit in a state described by a 4-dimensional vector.  This vector actually describes the joint state of Alice and Bob's quantum bits, and there is no way to describe Alice's quantum bit alone.  This is a very important distinction to make if you want to comprehend the material, and this book does not make it here.  We also learn that in teleportation, "The transfer of quantum information appears to happen instantly, though Bob needs to first receive classical information regarding the result of Alice's measurement before validating his own result."  I'm not even sure what this sentence is trying to say.  What does validating mean in this context?  The definition of uniformity is wrong.  The authors do not appear to understand the concepts behind this definition, or if they do, they are incapable of communicating these concepts to the reader.    In the factoring algorithm, the second condition in the definition of order of r modulo N is incorrect.  First it has a 1 in the right-hand-side, and the authors meant to put a 0 there.  Second, this condition does not belong in the correct mathematical definition of order.  And finally, they don't need this condition since they don't seem to use it anywhere.  To make matters worse, Figure 5.10, which illustrates the factorization process for 21, shows 1 times 11 being equal to 16.  To be fair to the authors, these errors have now been corrected in the errata, and I haven't looked at earlier chapters of the book, which may be better than the chapters I did look at.   
 If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but!  Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors?  Is anyone that foolish? Oh, and can she possible squeeze "Texas Ranger" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page? Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's.  
 If you plan to learn php from this book, i suggest you start looking for another, this is just a dictionary about all terminolgy and commands regards php, but with no excercices!!! well.. there are a few lazy excercises. Its only a description of the methods i mean.. if you are reading about the function echo() you will read something like. "ok, you should use echo in this way "echo "this book sucks", echo is for show you some info on screen, or if you are reading about loops, like for.. "ok. for is for looping! like 1 to 10".. that's it! now you are an php expert!!!.. if there was a posibility to rate this as -5 i would 
 This book is an unresearched, fictional account of a much more complicated business.  Borns can't interview a few people over two months and write something that has anything to do with the comedy business.  Total  rubbish!. It was used as a vehicle for a climber in the business to do just  that.  It was immediatly in the bins at KMart and sat there for a year.   Don't waste your money.  By the way, if she's such a great author, where's  anything else she's written??  She got a ten thousand dollar advance, and  the publisher rues the day they did that 
 I wanted a dictionary that contained graphical representations of symbols, not just a textual reference. I was very disappointed when I received it 
 horrible. as some have said, names are misused, images are confusing, greatly lacking in explanation. i've been banging my head against this thing for two and a half weeks and i give up. clunky workflow examples and frankly outdated pipeline. anyone interested in a book like this would do themselves a favor by checking out Gnomon Studios or Digital Tutors. they present more sophisticated and intuitive workflows. save your money and use the manual that came with your software as reference with the video guides available from the above mentioned companies. it'll save you from the inevitable ulcers Learning Maya 7 will cause. p.s. been using EIAS since '95. Not new to this game. hope the review helps 
 Very disappointing version of this story.  I was hoping to see the actual Horton, animation and all and this was a page turner with a voice attached.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Don't bother 
 I'll be honest -- after reading 50 pages of this book, I got off the StairMaster at the gym, put the book in my bag, and had no interest in reading any more of it. It just wasn't that interesting. It read more like a history of the Bhagwan Rajneesh, and less a story about Guest's childhood experiences. If you want to read about horrifying childhoods or kids in cults, try "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress" by Susan Jane Gilman or "Running with Scissors" by Augusten Burroughs. Either one is a more entertaining and less laborious to read 
 Instead of a testament to his climbing expeditions, this book might best serve as a testament to what seems to be Jim Wickwire's blatant misogyny and egocentrism.  After detailing how he decided his wife should leave college to support him, Wickwire regales us semi-boastfully with anecdotes relating how he expected his wife to be nothing more than a housekeeper, child-rearer, and "sex object" (his words).  After insisting on a large family, and getting offended at a well-meaning priest who gently suggested birth control, Wickwire  (by his own admission) proceeds to by-and-large shirk his duties as a father to all five of his children, supporting them only in the economic sense.    We then get to read his thoughts about the innate subordinism of female climbers, and their tendency toward sexual hijinks on the mountains.  The brunt of Wickwire's finger-pointing rests solidly on the shoulders of the female climbers he discusses, until he falls "in love" with Marty Hoey, a talented female climber with the sense, it seems, never to have gotten seriously involved with Wickwire, despite his attempts to the contrary.  Wickwire seems to read much into incidents like feet (separated by different sleeping bags) accidentally touching in a overcrowded tent.  After the reader is forced to endure reading a series of desperate, petulant, and adolescent notes and conversations directed from Wickwire to Hoey, he recounts her death on Everest perfunctorily, for the most part, and in terms of how his wife forgave him for this one-sided indiscretion. All things considered, I'm not sure who should be more outraged: Mary Lou Wickwire, reading her husband's embarassing account of "falling in love" with Hoey (and knowing all her friends and peers will be reading it too), or Marty Hoey herself, to whom Wickwire attributes a number of childish and maudlin love notes, and who is no longer here to defend herself.  To be fair, Wickwire may not be the narrow-minded boor he appears to be as when, in 1985, he sadly acknowledges of the inevitable entry of women into the legal profession (one wonders what rock he was living under, or climbing over, not to know that women entered the legal profession long before then).  The book, while also hampered by a ridiculous title, is full of stilted prose and dialogue.  In Wickwire's world, climbers never say things like "We've gotta get down the mountain, fast." Instead, they make proclamations like, "We must descend quickly, or we shall perish upon the mountain." If they were climbing in King Arthur's time, maybe; in this day and age, no one speaks like that.  As a result, the dialogue sounds stilted and fictitious, even if it had a basis in fact.  The prose lingers too long, and clumsily,  on Wickwire's relationships with those around him, even though his relationships seem rather shallow.  Again, this may be the fault of the co-writer or the source, one never knows.  I would heartily recommend saving your money and time, and reading a more climbing-related and less self-centered and angsty text 
 I realize that this "novel" was written as a companion to a video game, but if you're going to write something and put your name on it, it should be better than this. The "story" is that the Chinese have invaded some contested islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. gets involved and the Chinese declare war on the U.S. A submarine, the Cheyenne, is sent to the area. What follows are a dozen or so scenarios that a U.S submarine might encounter in this setup. However, there is no character development nor depth to the story. The American sub encounters a Chinese sub and sinks it. Then it encounters 2 subs and sinks them and so on and so on. This one American sub is destroying the entire Chinese navy single handedly. There is no suspense at all as the Cheyenne is never in any danger. Everything it does works, nothing the Chinese do matters. Their equipment is inferior, their submariners are inferior. This book is very repetitive with no suspense, no real plot and no believability. There is an overabundance of technical data about the submarines and their weapons which makes for very boring reading. I don't really know what the point of this book was 
 This film is as bad as the first Howling film was good. The plot is so hackneyed and predictable that you start to pray it will get it over with soon.  I understand that the author of the original book was angry that Joe Dante changed the plot for Howling 1. This film is said to be closer to his original vision. All I can say is thank god that Dante altered it. See Dante's original, American werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps,Dog Soldiers, Underworld, anything but this. It's an embarassment to cinema 
 If I could give this zero stars, I would.  This story advertises itself as a true story about infertility and the joys of adoption.  Instead, it's a story about the author and her highly dysfunctional marriage to her husband Joe.  Most of the book documents their constant fighting.  Joe stresses many times throughout the book that he doesn't want children.  In fact, it took several years for her to convince him to marry her, as she writes "I clung, I implored, I pleaded.  I couldn't, wouldn't, let go...I began to despise him."    Please, if anyone reading this review is considering Chinese adoption, do not read this book.  As a mother to a daughter adopted from China in 2004, I can tell you that it has been the best thing to happen to me, and to my husband.  My husband was thrilled with the idea of adopting, unlike the author's husband who is selfish and hates children.  Do not let this book turn you away from adoption.  Most adoptive parents do not have terribly dysfunctional relationships.  It saddens me that these two selfish adults adopted a child.  I hope for their child's sake that their marriage improves 
 This is the worst pan I have ever had.  We love mini muffins and have had Wilton and other pans.  They are hard to clean so I thought I would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap.  1st.  The silicone smell was horrible. 2nd.  The pan warped in oven.  I used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd.  I washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th.  The muffins did not come out.  I used spray I waited until cool and still they stuck.  I will never buy silicone anything.  Don't waiste your money 
 Peter Robinson is one of my favorite mystery writers.  I am now trying to get through the audio cd version of Playing with Fire.  The narrator, as I can picture him, is speaking with the spittle collecting and the corners of his mouth.  His attempt at portraying the characters' voices is pathetic.  He should just read it straight out as his "normal" voice is not bad at all.  The story will be good, I know, but have to suffer through this reading may not be worth it 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 I picked this book up at random from the library and I cannot believe how badly written and amateurish it is.  First of all, it seems to be written for a 7th grade audience; the language is that simplified and dumbed down.  I realize this takes place in a small town, but some serious breaches of confidentiality take place.  A dentist casually gabs about the dental problems of a current patient.  Has he never heard of HIPAA?  Hannah is allowed to enter the victim's apartment unaccompanied and take whatever she wants.  At the least it should have been cordoned off with police tape.  Naturally, she finds obvious clues that the police somehow missed.  The identity of the killer is so obvious, that as I was reading I would sometimes wonder if I had guessed incorrectly and this person was really a red herring.  Nope, come to find out I was right all along.  The only positive thing I can say about this book is that some of the recipes sound interesting and I'm looking forward to trying them out.  
 Disappointing to say the least.  Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son.  I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience.  There are perhaps an additional 20-30 pages of new material in this book.  Save your money and go straight to book 3 
 I bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet (and never worked again). Very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun 
 What a piece of crap. Just putting this together broke it. And was missing one of the snap parts. Truely a waste of money 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this book.  The title is VERY misleading. THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT CONEY ISLAND!!! This is a book about carny people and Stein took the sleaziest most unattractive pictures of  them. I know Coney Island.  I lived there for 15 years and still visit  annually. There is history of amusements and cultures that are not captured  in this book.  Out of 80+ pictures, there are only 3, including the cover  wrap, about the attractions of Coney Island.  The rest is a picture book of  people. If you are looking for a nostalgic journey about Coney Island-SAVE  THE RETURN COST &  FORGET ABOUT THIS BOOK!! 
 Investigations into the "Fort Pillow Massacre" led by General William Sherman himself, determined that Forrest was not at fault and did not perpetrate any such "massacre." In fact, Forrest was credited with stopping abuses. Congressional hearings in 1871 absolved General Forrest of atrocities committed by the KKK (he actually dissolved the KKK to stop outrages).  The "massacre" along with the "Emancipation" Proclamation (which actually freed no one at all) remain as the two greatest perpetrations of propaganda in the American Civil War, and are disproven by historical fact.  The fact remains that, love him or hate him, Nathan Bedford Forrest was one of the most remarkable soldiers in American history. He rose from the ranks to Lieutenant-General, a commander whose tactics were studied for generations by the British Royal Army. It's unfortunate that subsequent historians have demonized the heroes while elevating war criminals such as William Tecumseh Sherman. One star for bad research and the ongoing whitewashing of history to suit political correctness 
 Deceptive advertising.  It should say FHSS.  If you want DSSS, don't get this 
 I bought two copies of this SACD, both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly, be forewarned. I dont have any other problems with other SACDs so I assume it is in the production somewhere. They would lock up for no reason, this is right out of the box, both copies. 
 Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad... 
 The Callahan's short stories have always been among my favorites -- they're funny, uplifting, clever and sometimes deeply moving. Spider Robinson has written a wide variety of other short stories that are also intelligent and witty.  Unfortunately, none of the Callahan's novels are particularly good; it wasn't fun when Heinlein went off for a hundred-odd consecutive pages about how cool his characters were, and at this point that's what the Callahan's novels have degraded into.  The plot here is that Jake's new bar in Key West has been targeted by Tony Donuts, Jr., the son of an unmemorable villain from one of the Lady Sally books. They come up with this silly, over-elaborate plan to get Tony's mobster boss to whack him, focused on the time travel powers of Jake's irritating precocious daughter. The subplot also revolves around said daughter, as a Child Protection agent shows up, a bizarre cariacture of conformity who's identical to (and turns out to be related to) the bizarre cariactures of conformity that got Jake's previous bar shut down.  After a long sequence of Robinson trying and failing to write a sci-fi Carl Hiaasen novel, there's a wholly manufactured crisis that has nothing to do with the previous story -- because every Callahan's novel has to end with a repeat of the super-empath sequence from "The Mick of Time."  Save yourself some tsuris and go re-read the original stories -- or pick up one of Robinson's compilations of short stories, such as By Any Other Name. That's where he really shows his strength 
 I have had these salt shakers for over a year.  They are terrible.  It is a fight everytime you want to fill them.  I am buying new ones 
 I'm not sure what to say to help you decide if this book is for you or not. For me, the answer is NOT! At first glance, The Dragon Legacy appears as a book of non-fiction, but in reality it is FICTION. Being that it is fiction, I would expect some drama or adventure, something to sustain a person while they read through it. But alas, that is not the case. I also don't see what anything in this book has to do with the Holy Grail OR the Dragon Bloodlines; which are the reasons I purchased this book in the first place. I feel like I wasted my money because I didn't get any answers I was looking for.  Nicholas de Vere or Prince Nicholas de Vere as he claims is his real name, writes this story in college thesis format. On that point, it is written very well. However, this isn't a story to me.   This whole book was very disappointing for me. As I have heard stories of the dragon bloodlines since I was a little child and as an adult have been eagerly looking for evidence that relates to the stories. What I do know is that there is definately more than one blood line! Mr. Vere claims there is but one bloodline... and spends the book trying to prove that the bloodline is related to Jesus, the M Kings, the Eygptians, the Druids, the Elves, the Fairies, and of course himself... It's all just a little to off the wall for me.  Well, that's my 2 Cents... it's only my opinion, I'm the first to admit that it doesn't make me right.. 
 This book, this so called scientific social book, is a tower constructed by lies and half truths based upon the author's (and the liberal media's) hatred toward Christians.  There is no such thing as a war against science by Republicans and the Christians.  There IS such a thing as a war against God, very easily  seen in such "I hate Christians" books like this one, but that is to be considered later on.  Basically, this book is a 342 page book founded upon Christianphobia.  It is a witch hunter's book that tries to demean and belittle and lie about Christians.  I will make this brief, but specific on two examples.  1) Darwinism and 2) Abortion and Stem-Cell Research.    Why do I feel the need to stand up against the idea of teaching children about Evolution?  Why do I want to stand up against the humanistic agenda of destroying the minds and souls of our children?  Why do I feel the need to push for the consideration of Intelligent Design to be offered toward these same children?  Because evolution is false.  Evolution is not true.  Evolution holds no solid ground.  Have I studied evolution?  Yes.  Before becoming a Christian I was an outspoken apostle of Evolution until I was shown the facts and the facts are this...evolution is a fallacy and the only reason why Evolution is being so championed in the class rooms is because the humanist/liberal hate Christians.  They call us anti-intellectuals, strangely enough, and  yet the driving force of the liberal party is a paranoid dilution driven hatred toward Christians.  Here are some authors and their titles that I challenge you with:  Ralph Muncaster's Dismantling Evolution; Phillip Johnson's Darwin on Trial; David Snoke's A Biblical Case for an Old Earth; and finally, Fazale Rana and Hugh Ross' Who was Adam.    Then there is abortion.  What is so scientific about abortion?  You kill a child.  Simple.  Why should the scientific community care so much about abortion?  Because they do not understand the concept of human rights (their human rights are rights that go along with whatever the PC pop culture has to say this week).  Stem-Cell research is a tag along on the abortion supporting train because these so called scientists want you the reader to think that if the two do not go together then all these people will die a painful death if Stem-Cell research is not provided.  Abortion in itself is murder.  Simple as that.  You murder a child.  A child with a mind, a child with a heart, and a child with a soul.  That is not emotional blackmail toward women, that is just the simple truth.  And Stem-Cell research?  You do not have to harvest embryos like some scientist and politician out of Brave New World.  There are far better ways, far safer way, to study Stem-Cell and how it may or may not help those who are in need.  I suggest you read works such as ProLife Answers to ProChoice Arguments by Randy Alcorn    There is no Republican war against science.  There are many scientists like David Snoke and Hugh Ross that stand up and support the truth that comes, from the very heart of the matter, from the Bible.  Republicans and Christians do not long for some "Dark Age" of society.  They, we, I, want the truth to be shown in society away from the liberal bewitching Christianphobic fanaticism that comes from those like Sam Harris and Chris Mooney 
 I kept thinking it would make sense or get better or have some substance.   It was remarkably bad!   I threw it away after reading 200 pages or so and it only has 277.  What a waste of time and money!!!!!!!.. 
 that a book about real estate (creating FINANCIAL independence no less), both residential and COMMERCIAL, and covers no math, no numbers.  How can a book even propose to teach you about real estate and not tell you how to evaluate it?  Real estate, or any investment for that matter, is ALL about the numbers. The numbers it does include are so basic, anyone who tried to buy an apartment complex or commercial property using them would be slaughtered 
 The book isn't good at all. I'm sorry. I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies (Hell House included) I was really excited to read this. I have heard many complaints about the book from calling it "soft porn" to "sick soft porn" and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale. Sacrilege in a book called...Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up. Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary. I doubt these were Mathis' "sexual fantasies" in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying. It is an effective way to convey horror to a reader. Similar to enacting horrible violence on children, or worse, babies in cinema (try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face). Mathis should not be condemned for content.  Here is what he did right. He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science. Much like I am Legend used science to define its vampires, Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story.  The bad parts may be more numerous. His characterization is horrid. There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them. You will remember Barrett by his limp, Fishcer by his fear, Florence by her religious beliefs, and Edith...well because there is no one else. They are paper thin and have no real motivations. The pacing seems poor too. A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you, the reader. As a matter of fact the revelations themselves, when all is said and done, are really pretty dull. There is also a habit characters have, when going into great lengths of exposition that goes on for pages, to cup their hands around a coffee cup. It seems too much like a commercial for me! Anyway, the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very few vivid descriptions in the book. Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like, I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages. What was it about the atmosphere that, say Fischer found so scary? We needed the scenes to be better developed. By the end I was so tired of lines like:  "God do you know what this means?" "What?" "I can't tell you now but it's freakin' awesome!"  That exchange is not in the book but you will find many similar moments throughout. Just tell us already! The fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of weak. This book is not worth it, unfortunately. I hate to say it because I Am Legend is really good (though it did suffer from some of the same things I pointed out above, though on a smaller level). It's the classic "show don't tell" advice 
 The third wave agenda in an attempt to defend it's modern day merrit, in the face of "post-modern" critics, has only succeeded in promoting "post-modern feminism". The arguments made are proof enough that the third wave is out of touch with the current direction in feminism 
 I was recently investigating options for single sourcing when I came across Kurt Ament's book Single Sourcing:  Building Modular Documentation.  Based on the glowing reviews the book received, I decided to order it from Amazon.com.  Unfortunately, the book was not what I expected.  For the price of $[...] on Amazon, the book provides little help to experienced professional writers. My biggest complaint is that too many pages of the book are spent promoting the author's own ideas of style and usage rather than discussing true single sourcing issues. (134 out of 210 pages, to be precise, were dedicated to matters of style.)  Some of the style and usage guidelines are handy for modular documentation, however, I believe each company should decide its own appropriate guide for style and usage rather than relying on the author's word. Had he couched his preferred guidelines as examples, perhaps I would be less inclined to view them negatively.  Granted, understanding how to simplify and standardize language is key to developing text for reuse within a body of work and reuse text for localization.  Writers need to understand how to simplify and standardize text before starting to think about how to leverage tools for single sourcing.  Describing how to use standard language, however, is different than promoting a writing style, and probably requires far fewer pages than Ament dedicated to it.  One of the reviews on Amazon raved about how well this book could be applied in conjunction with Information Mapping. I disagree. The author clearly does not approve of breaking processes or procedures into tables, which is a cornerstone of Information Mapping. In fact the author has very strict guidelines about when you should use a table and when you shouldn't. (Again, he is pontificating a particular style rather than offering solid advice on single sourcing.) Don't take my word for it; examine the table of contents very carefully before you buy this book.  What the book does well, is offer good general advice on where to start thinking about chuncking your documentation in order to reuse it again and again. Also, Ament provides a concise lexicon of single sourcing terms that will help you properly articulate your ideas to your teammates. Most of the flags and highlighting I used in the book were confined to chapters 1, 2, and 5.  This book might serve well in an introductory professional writing course, but if your company is seeking guidance on single sourcing, find a book that is tool specific or find a book that sticks to single sourcing and leaves style and usage decisions up to you 
 CONTENT PROTECTED IS A VIOLATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLES RIGHTS, DON'T SUPPORT ARTISTS THAT ALLOW THIS SOFTWARE ON THEIR ALBUM 
 Much of the information in this book is not specific to black and white photography.  It is very generic and could serve as the introduction to a broader book on the topic.  The chapters on composition and the "zone system" are disappointingly thin, and there are very few photographs within the book to serve as illustrative examples supporting the text.  The paper is of mediocre paperback quality, which makes the few photographs within the book look washed out and featureless.  The author says this material is collected from his years of teaching the subject; I'd hate to be one of his students 
 Alright, here goes the first intelligent low rating this album has recieved. No I'm not some christian preaching to you, I'm actually a fan of manson. I think the lyrics on this album are pretty good, but mediocre music. My main problem with this album is the fact that it is a total rip-off of david bowie. Let's look at the man himself. Manson wears contacts to make it look like he has two different colored eyes, while bowie actually has two different eyes. With Ziggy Stardust, Bowie's image became androgynous, just as manson's always has been. Now let's look at the actual albums of Ziggy and Antichrist. They both tell the story of a self-destructive unearthly rock and roll superstar. Manson's shock rock symbol even bears a strong resemblance to the Ziggy Lightning bolt. And this all comes from a man constantly preaching individualiry, while making an idol of himself, and slamming other artists for ripping him off. And then he put out mechanical animals, an exact replica of ziggy stardust, and ironically enough it's what made him truly famous. I just think it's a little hypocritical. Check out Holy Wood. It is much better lyrically and musically, and far more original. The other thing that really pisses me off is the vocal department. A lot of fans are saying his voice is underated, but i hate to say, he really can't sing. Watch the guns god and government tour and see how he really sounds. All he's basically good for are his writing skills.. 
 What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn.  It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane!  The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape.  I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 This book should be titled "My Argument in Favor of Open Adoption."  It offered NO help in writing a birthmother letter.  Did I misunderstand the subject of this book when I purchased it or is it advertised as a great source for adoptive parents on how to reach out to birthmothers?   I tried hard to get through it, but found it useless in guiding me through the process of writing this letter.   There must be books out there that will help the adoptive parent through the process of private adoption, but this is not the one.  Keep looking. 
 Several years ago I used DeLorme's Street Atlas with a USB GPS receiver. The software worked but the interface was lousy. This year I tried Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the Delorme software, but still surprisingly clumsy. And the help is possibly the worst I have seen in a Microsoft product (that's saying a lot). Here are some of the problems:  1. Street & Trips is expecting a GPS receiver that uses a **COM PORT**. Are you kidding me? In 2007??? The Delorme Earthmate 20 (usb) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software, but why is this necessary??? (And it was not trivial to get it to work.)  2. The handling of pushpins (identifying spots on the map), favorite places, and the like, is extremely clumsy. (Although, contrary to another review, you don't to re-enter the information each time. You just save the file and reload it.)  3. Directions are sometimes not so great. Why would you instruct someone to "turn left" if you don't know which direction they're pointing (e.g., when you're stationary in a parking lot)? Much better in such cases to say "head NE" or some such. Freeway exits (at least in So. California) were often not handled well. (One freeway entrance was identified as a "local road", which at the time proved quite confusing.)  4. Why doesn't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you "on-route" once you're off-route? You can push F3, but why is this necessary?  5. I never got the voice providing driving guidance to work. The online help was useless. I'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it, but it should be trivial.  6. In general, the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together. I'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot (I bought this software after all), but I find that much MS software is bad precisely because it feels like it's cobbled together without much attention given to integration. It's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it.  Given this experience, I will probably give the Delorme software another try next time around. 
 This book is indeed scholarly but to whom?  Much of the data is concerning useless facts.  It is not intended to inform of the Black Death as I thought it would.  There are no scientific facts written; only boring useless facts of land ownerships and church renovations and construction.  I have gained nothing from this book 
 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 I am a full-figured woman at 5'10.  I am always searching for books that will optimize my wardrobe and give me the best look possible in my clothes.  I recevied this book today and it is the WORST book I have read in this subject.  The 3 body types are very vague, not clear of what type of person fits each category (a silhouette picture would have been very helpful here). A Tankini, what is that? The same points are repeated throughout the book.  Finally, this book is written for women who see themselves as fat and need to learn how to put on clothes just to walk out of the house, not with any style or sense of self.  I will not even give this book away, it is horrible to give to someone else.  
 Perhaps I had been expecting a true sequeal to the original. I was so excited when I saw the book but instead of a taut, touching tale I got a rambling, frequently boring, difficult to follow story that I had to force myself to finish.  It seemed more a tale of politics and religious infighting than a science fiction story.  Problems?  How about WAY too many characters, many with multiple names. I consider myself intelligent and widely read but the rush of people created such a flux that the plot seemed almost secondary.  I liked the hero but for all his potential he did little more than whine, worry and wonder.  His boss, the antipope, became the star of the show along with the swordsman.    The story did not "flow" and bogged down several times in minor details.  The first section covereding the time in the abbey passed uneventfully but for a few personal crises. Then we journey toward the conclave and are introduced to host of new folks.  Finally we arrive in the city and meet yet another cast of characters.  The story was as much about Native American culture as anything.  The language issues, interesting at first, became tiresome as we switched from various dialects (some almost unpronouncable with special symbols) to Latin (frequently) to English.  All in all, not a success 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 This is $6.50 a pound pluss shipping. My local store sells it for $2.25 a pound 
 I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability.  It's going back in the morning.  This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches.  I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.    For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 After reading this book, I caught a duck to use on the links. Despite naming it Ping, my distance and putting went down the toilet. I would not suggest using Ping for your average hacker

  I was an avid romance reader for over 20 years. I stopped reading a few years back as I simply got bored with the plot lines and characters - everything started blending after awhile. I returned to reading last year and found a handful of interesting and talented authors to fire up my interest and imagination again.   I  picked up Virigina Henley again.  I thought I'd try her again all these years later and remind myself of her ability.    Sadly...memory came flooding back within 1-2 chapters of reading "The Pirate & The Pagan".  I remembered clearly why I stopped reading VH books.   1)  Although her heroines are feisty, full of passion and beautiful...they often have serious potty mouths, attempt the most unusual activities, go over-board in everything they do and are usually self-centered chits - they are simply NOT believable or truely likeable main female characters. It took Summer having a baby and being imprisoned for her to stop being a selfish, spoiled and rotten little chit.    2) Although her hero's are often hot looking, well built, clearly well endowed and passionate leads...they are also hot headed, violent, angry, and a bit on the condescending side of things - not likeable traits in our main male leads.  3) Sex occurs early and often and many of the love scenes border on the female being smacked around and/or  being taken by force or worse - not appealing at all.     In this book, Rory/Ruark tossed and slapped Summer around one too many times for me. They forced her into sex scenes after dark arguments and heated fights. She may have been sexually attracted to them and wanted to be together but, not under those circumstances and she made that clear. He/they never apologized for their actions when out of line. She got angry each time but, almost seemed to accept this behavior because "she loved the man". Yuck!  Smacking a woman around was never in fashion - whether this book was written in 1880, 1990 or 2006!    Some readers felt the twist of the twin brothers "Ruark" and "Rory" was great. I thought it was poorly written, easy to see around and wasn't believable in the least. Each time one brother was around, the other was missing. They looked like each other, acted like one another, smelled like the other and Summer was supposed to be so attuned to each man? Her soul mate? Rory laughed and joked, Ruark was deep and serious - you mean a woman who loves you beyond all else couldn't see past this until the very end? Summer was clueless along with beautiful and self-centered.    I didn't find it enjoyable that Summer could so easily have sex with one brother, get pregnant while married to the other and play all these games with each of them. In turn, they played games with her. Back and forth it went. Sex, adultry, lies and more lies.  Hard to find redeeming characteristics in any of the main characters - Summer, Ruark and Rory. Frankly, the butler was the most honrorable and decent person in the whole book!  I could go on and on about all the foolish things in this story but, really it was simply about two people hot for each other. They fought, made up, had hot sex scenes, got mad again, misunderstandings abound, a few smacks occur now and then and it's back to fighting again. It was one big cycle. I don't feel the sex scenes were gross or untasteful - for sex scenes - they were written fine. It just happened too often to be interesting and exciting. You knew within each chapter Rory/Ruark would meet up with Summer and fireworks would fly no matter what and off they would go - mating away like rabbits in the spring.  If you are looking for a stimulating, imaginative and emotional read - this is not for you. If you just want some heavy sex scenes and a few man dominating woman passages, this is for you. I would recommend you don't waste your money on this book. It's outdated, boring and predictable. There are so many great books and authors out there - both older ones and newer ones. DON'T buy this book if you have any quality standards when it comes to a romance story.

I know I won't be popular for what I said but...it's at least truthful and from someone who has read hundreds if not thousands of books in 20 years. To each his own I guess is how we should leave it...and leave this one I will!   
 I liked the first Green Day work - it was original, a bit too punky and whitetrash for me, but decent to listen too.  After dropping VERY large money for the last two albums I realized I was buying the same music just repackaged.  Even the Live versions on Foot In mouth sound exactly the same.  Save your money; either buy one of the first 2-3 albums of theirs or better yet, try something new 
 At the time that Douglas Sirk's first big American film, SUMMER STORM (an adaptation of Chekov's "The Hunting Party") was released, James Agee reviewed it and noted that although the film was (and I'm probably paraphrasing here) "20 years ahead of its' time" visually, the overall film "reeked of drugstore fiction."  And as far as I'm concerned, that remains the best description of Sirk's work in films; the application of slick and sophisticated visuals to gloppy, often trashy scripts, indeed an interest in the visuals above anything else in the film, such as the script or the performers.  Mind you, as a contract director at Universal, it was Sirk's job to direct the films he was given by the front office, but did the final product have to reek so completely of contempt and disinterest?  And reek this movie does.  A more engaged director would have helped Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack, who were both good actors in other films, to ratchet down their performances as the no-good children of a wealthy Texas oil family.  And he would have demanded that Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall give something that approximated performances as Stack's best friend and abused/neglected wife (since the movie treated anything of a sexual matter with the blithering hysteria typical of 50's movies, it never becomes clear if Stack's inability to father children is the result of a low sperm count or closeted homosexuality).  Yes, the movie's photography (particularly in this carefully-restored print) is rich and shadowed, the costumes are always lavish (if not always attractive--couldn't Malone's character be trampy but tasteful?), and the studio orchestra's string section is working overtime.  But the combination of cold, fussy style, trashy script, and bad performances make the final result alienating and unpleasant.  In short, the sort of movie that made me switch of the Afternoon Movie when I was a kid.  And I almost never switched off the Afternoon Movie when I was a kid . .  
 I have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by DHL Global Mail. This is a ridiculous and unacceptable situation. I will never use Amazon again, I feel cheated 
 DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the "suggestions" this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3" should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: "why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights" and "the chain around the refrigerator." it shows a dancer ready to "feast" on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 this isn't kitiara at all!  this book fails to capture the spirit of kit.  fails miserably.... the book, which is suppose to capture kit's essence, doesnt even come close.  the kit in this book is boring and doesn't have  any of kit's spark.  i am horribly disappointed.. 
 Not The Original Film. Doesn't have the original disco scene with "I like the night life" song. THEY COMPLETELY RUINED THE MOVIE 
 This book has lots of platitudes and little substance.  The author frequently refers to various seminars and coaching that she provides, which is distracting and self-serving.  The book is poorly organized and doesn't have much concrete advice.  Don't waste your time on it 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 As a big Steamroller fan, perhaps my hopes were set a little too high.  I envisioned more original music (perhaps a more scarier vibe than the silly one this CD has to it) and maybe a few covered tunes.  Chips originals (from the Fresh Aire series)found on this CD outshine the weak efforts put forth on the covered and rearranged tracks.  The sound effects disc sets a great(and creepy)mood, that should had been followed through with some new and equally scary compositions.    If you're a die hard Mannheim fan (as in 'I just have to own everything Chip puts out') I say go for it.  But otherwise spend your Halloween money elsewhere.  Overall this is a forced and lazy effort 
 this is the first jane austen's novel that was poorly done into a movie. i could never imagine that bbc would did such a bad job. all the casts are so bad, the screenplay, my god, is so bad that it would take a great deal of patience to watch along and stay in a sitting position. all the casts are so bad, none of them are likable unless you are just like one of them. what a terrible directing and acting. the screenplay, my god, is so bad, i just don't want to get into the details... stay away from this deadbeat and don't waste your lifetime in this pathetic movie, see other versions 
 I really wish I had read the book flap before buying this book.  Had I read that it had anything to do with NASCAR, I would have put it down and spent my $25+ on another book....my mistake.  The ONLY reason I actually read the whole book is because I did pay $25+ for it and just felt like I should.  It was not entertaining and just dragged on and on.  So, not only was it dull and slow, it was about NASCAR...a sport and subject that is just not my cup of tea.  I love the Stephanie Plum series and will continue to purchase Evanovich books in that series, but will not buy anything else 
 Indulgent. And boring. If you're not an engineer, or steeped in this culture, don't bother. 
 This movie started off about as refreshing as you could get. Sure, there were "Lifetime channel" moments and such but for a horror movie at least it didnt just dump a bunch of hapless teenagers in the woods for them to be hacked one by one.    The atmosphere was eerie and convincing.  The cave shots were well done, the tension was building ever so slowly and it was somewhat un-nerving when you just knew that something bad was brewing.  So, the first part of the movie was thumbs up all the way.  Unfortunately, like sooooooo many other horror films it resorts to silly blood spatters and totally unbelievable situations and it gets old rather quickly.  The creative tension that got me hooked was quickly replaced by absurdity. Too much ketchup, too many frantic scenes of the "monster guys" jumping around, and of course...the completely silly "tough" chick that Kung-Fu'ed her way through most of the monsters like they were invalids. That alone killed it.... the main characters were disposing the bad guys too easily and some of the ways they killed them was laughable.  I was angry at this movie not so much because I wasted my time but because it had a lot of potential and seemed to run out of ideas so they went the "Gorefest" route and completely chickened out of making what could have been a classic if it was done right.  Remember how perfectly the original Alien movie slowly but surely built wicked tension and it never released you from that tension?  Remember how uncomfortable that movie made you feel for almost the whole running time?  This film started that way.... it was very creepy and made me feel uneasy. Just like Alien.  However, Alien never let up and did NOT turn into a pointless gore-fest like this movie did.  Too bad, it really is.  Not Recommended... but rent it, dont buy it if you have to see i 
 It appears that one of the two authors worked on gathering an eclectic set of anecdotes while the other wrote the surrounding text. Neither took the time to read the other's work a policy I'd also recommend for you 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 Somewhat outdated, rehashed and self aggrandizing. More historical than cutting edge. You can do better! 
 I started out as a lit major, then switched to linguistics.  I worked three years as a medical transcriptionist.  I've never had trouble reading anything.  But this book is so full of fourteen-letter words, acronyms, and other jargon, it's just plain unpleasant to read.  The information is sound, and definitely interesting.  But if you just want to understand the physiology of trauma, read the first section of Levine's "Waking The Tiger" instead (the rest of the book is rhetoric); it's a quick and easy read and presents the same basic information.    And if you're a PTSD sufferer, this is definitely not the book for you!  It's written by an M.D. for those interested in the physical aspects of trauma, but offers absolutely no help (or even resources) for trauma patients.  Try one of the breathing books or tapes by Gay Hendricks.  Hendricks addresses releasing trauma directly and clearly.  
 Making History is about a Cambridge student, Michael, and a physics professor who, by transporting sterility drugs through time to a well in Austria, create a world were Hitler had never been born. Making History is conceptually interesting, but poorly executed and at times exceedingly dull. Many of the action sequences are written in a screenplay format, which leaves some of the book's major scenes without any narrative description and results in tedious chapters where characters act without discernable motivation. The slower paced, more interesting first person narrative style is abandoned (it seems) in favor of getting quickly through scenes that, though vital to the plot, do not afford the oppurtunity for clever banter or amusing description that the author is so fond of. The resolution is forced and unsatisfying, and there are glaring holes in the plot that are never resolved. Fry is a witty writer, but I think he is overreaching with this book.    
 I bought this through Amazon for my older daughter when it first came out.  She tired of it after a year.  Currently, it is one of the dog's frisbee's 
 Yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write.  My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading.  The following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes:  "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand."  One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  The result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  I don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and I don't understand why readers put up with it.  Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  Everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  I think you get the picture.  Few characters stand out on their own.  Even Lafayette is just another young officer.  The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  And Shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull.  Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin's mind.  But the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  Either I'm a lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well.  In addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington, Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America.  That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England, and the continental congress in America.  In effect, this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced.  Some aspects of the story are interesting.  I enjoy reading about Washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him.  I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  Most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold 
 As a fan of Sean's picking and musicianship this CD was one of the biggest dissapointments ever.  I was expecting to hear at least a few tight, technical flat pick runs ... instead I got a bunch of tunes that sound like washed up drivel from the latest pop Christian rock CD.  Even when Sean did decide to do some good picking most of the time he overdubbed a tenor sax on the run so you couldn't even hear him ... an extremely cheesey sound is what you get.  I kept skipping each track hoping to hear something decent, but every song made me want to hurl ... litteraly.  You might like this CD if you are into Matchbox 20 and The GooGoo Dolls, but if you're looking for good new acoustic music along the lines of Mike Marshall and Bryan Sutton don't buy this borring, depressing CD 
 The "you got served" movie was awsome i loved it so much i bought it.. So i thought i would buy the "take it to the streets" too but when i saw it it was the most dissapointing clip i have ever seen. it had 2 short routines from the movie, a little interview thing with breakdancing and krumping, and their "hot & new" routine that wasnt even that good. i am a b-boy and i do a little bit of hip-hop and believe me there are better things to waste your money on than thi 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 Reasonably interesting book but not if one is specifically interested in the periodic table or its evolution.  Only one or two chapters are actually on the periodic table.  In addition the final 40 or so pages consist just of a "catalog of elements", essentially a complete list of all the elements, the dates they were discovered etc.  This is nothing more than a page filler for a book that is well written but rather too superficial for anybody really interested in chemistry and physics 
 John Hodgeman is great when he's on the Jon Stewart show.  The book, sadly,  is boring even as bathroom reading 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth 
 When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 This book, although beautifully written, did not make sense.  I was intrigued by the characters yet finished the book not understanding their motivations.  I would have liked to know more about the narrator, Susan, and her life immediately after the fatal accident.  Instead I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story, with big gaps missing throughout. Perhaps some skillful editing would have made this more of a complete tale 
 Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer  Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer 
 I think the biggest problem with this book is that it was published and edited by his parents.  I admit I thought it was pretty bad, in fact it was some of the worst fantasy I have ever read.  When a real editer would have helped this very weak writing come up to snuff, instead his parents went along with him 
 My daughter loves fantasy books and vampires and werewolves in particular. On a trip to Barnes and Noble, she excitedly bought this book. Well I decided to go ahead and read it for myself beforehand, because we enjoy sharing books. I'm really glad I did. It was pretty sexually charged and my daughter is uncomfortable with a lot of that in her reading material. The main character wasn't anyone my daughter would want to hang around. At 16 years old, Vivian was arrogant, vain and sexually permissive, would drink, claim she smoked pot (who knows if she didn't) as an excuse for lying about why she was grounded. Vivian would continually try to get in a situation where she could have sex with her boyfriend. She had a very clear idea that she could exude power through sex and would tease older men at the bar where her mother worked and even teased her boyfriends father. She ends up in the role of Queen of the pack to a 24 year old King with all that entails. At 16, having a sexual relationship with a 24 year old is out of hand. Vivian thinks she killed someone, but chooses to keep this to herself. Morals are thin if they exist at all. Right and wrong doesn't occur to the characters in this book.  The good aspects of Vivian's character just weren't enough to equal out all the other behaviors. She was loyal to her mother, even though her relationship with her was usually strained. She could be loyal to her pack (but usually just when it suited her) and tried to be loyal to her code of the Moon.  As a Mom I get really torn with decisions like this. This book was really well written. A lot of kids her age seem to really love it according to book reviews on Amazon. It won a lot of awards. It was chosen for the Junior Literary Guild selection, which we're members of, so we get the selected books for her age group. So on that hand, I was tempted to let her read it.  On the other hand, the main character in this book isn't someone I would want to come to my house. She's not someone I would want my daughter to be friends with. She emulates behavior that isn't acceptable for us. Books are friends. And this isn't a good friend for my daughter.  I worry about all the kids her age that read this book and think Vivian is wonderful! I read the reviews on Amazon and Barnes and Noble and these girls think Vivian is fantastic because she's so powerful! She can get away with anything. She can party. She can have sex. She can be a Wolf Queen and live with no consequences. Kids in reviews say they love this book because it's about cliques in school and all kids have to deal with that. Um. No. School is mentioned when she meets her boyfriend and she does have to deal with his friends later on, but I wouldn't say this book is a great relationship tool for helping your kids deal with social issues.  If I wasn't reading this book with my daughter in mind, I could have enjoyed it more. But I find it disturbing to read about a 16 year old and her permiscuity not only with boys her own age, but men much older. I hate to focus on that, but the book does, so I have to. Not all kids in this age group are ready for books with this subject matter. Mine is embarassed to read about it, and was glad I let her know before she cracked the cover 
 The Sacred Romance is rambling and incoherent.  The author's nearly irrelevant personal reflections litter the chapters and do nothing but complicate extremely simple concepts.  If you read this book, you will spend 25% of your time reading and 75% struggling to make sense of what you read 
 [this] book was ok, and I read [the authors'] first book. [The authors are] right on with diet and what to eat and what not to eat but perscritive drugs is not the answer.  They only sugar coat the problem.  Have to remove with a good candida program and lots of cultures that are natural.  Why won't...doctors get back to basic and start giving advice the natural way and don't chemical drugs that damage other organs like your liver and kidneys 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 If you want to know about Neil Armstrong - the real man, not the man conjured up in some author's mind - read "First Man" by James Hansen. Hansen actually sat down for 50+ hours of interviews with Armstrong himself.  As they say - "from the horse's mouth" 
 I really don't have any use for this book. There are no suggested ages for the books being a read-aloud. The youngest that these book suggestions can be *read* is third grade.  I'm also unhappy with the exclusion of ghost stories and the like. I know there are people who would love these suggestions *because* of the exclusion. I'm not one of them, and there was no warning about it. I feel that I've wasted $12 that would have been better spent on another book. I highly recommend "Honey for a Child's heart" rather than this book 
 The author was invited to speak to a group. In appreciation, the group presented a certificate to him. The "headline" was lettered in Blackletter (Old English), and set in all-caps. The author then told the group that whoever lettered the certificate would also likely steal sheep. He explained that 'one doesn't set Blackletter in all caps'. After reading that, I felt terrible for the designer, especially, and the group. The thank-you they presented was accepted with blistering sarcasm: openly, arrogantly, and callously.  Let me save you the cost of this book:  1) Don't use all-caps with display faces. Use it sparingly otherwise. 2) Limit use of several typefaces together. 3) When using more than one typeface in a piece, consider ancillary typeface-families designed by the same person. 4) Extreme arrogance is ugly and hurtful. Typeface transgressions rarely hurt anyone, although they obviously hinder legibility and the impact of the message. 5) Advice found elsewhere is more applicable, more altruistic, and better tasting

 I wrote Osprey Publishing and pointed out that in the chapter on Coral Sea and Midway; TBD Devastators were identified as TBF Avengers. The 35 Torpedo Bombers that were slaughtered at Midway were not all Avengers(Except for a small Midway detachment.) There were NO TBF's at the Coral Sea. How does this get through the editing and printing stages????? They said they would correct the error in future printings, I am stuck with a DUD copy. This is POOR publishimg at its best. I own thousands of dollars of Osprey books and I am mortified to say the least. 
 "The Book of J" is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the Pentateuch. Bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist, a lady of Solomon's court, who has been totally misunderstood. The next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of J by Rosenberg, who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation. The following two sections include Bloom's commentary on the book of J, its narrative, personalities and themes. This is the silliest book on the Hebrew Bible that I have ever read. It is obnoxious, almost totally unsubstantiated, and replete with simple misunderstandings of the Hebrew text. Bloom's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian (12) nor a biblical scholar (41) are the only parts of the book that I agree with. He mocks religious Jews, Christians, the "abominable Jeremiah" (176) and, with particular frequency, J's God. To the unprejudiced reader the God of the Hebrew Bible is majestic, awesome, and holy throughout, nothing like what Bloom describes. The arrogant claim that the Hebrew Bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that Bloom provides. Among other things, we learn that God sits in the terebrinths of Mamre eating curds (12, 258) (a total misreading of Genesis 18), that God loves David but not Moses (41) (contrary to Exodus 33:11-12 and Numbers 12:7), that Moses becomes the founder of circumcision (245) (contrary to Genesis 17), and that God doesn't punish Moses for good reason (34), without much explanation. However, we are told that traditional Jewish and Christian expositors are "weak readers" (34) and "mad" (246). Virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book, though we hear occasionally about Noth, von Rad and Van Seters, among a few others. To his credit, Bloom mentions the opening words of Cassuto's commentary on Genesis (20), but fails to engage at all with Cassuto's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis. I recommend Cassuto's "The Documentary Hypothesis" as the perfect antidote to "The Book of J". Not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of Bloom's assertions. Other literature of the ancient Near East receives no treatment. The content of the Pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium BCE, and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the Near East of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources. For the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the Hebrew Bible generally, I recommend Kitchen's monumental "On the Reliability of the Old Testament". Bloom and Rosenberg's transliteration is very inconsistent, and we're even treated to the non-existent form "v'yhi" (329). Rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text; but I think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better. Readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the Hebrew Bible should look elsewhere. In my opinion, the documentary hypothesis is speculative, unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence, and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion, and speculation to speculation. I do not recommend it 
 This is one of the most far-fetched, outrageous mysteries I've ever read.  Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist.  When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose.  His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another.  All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart.  The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies?  Come on.  Don't waste your time on this one. 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 I am so disappointed with White's scholarship, that I would not recommend this book 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history. Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions. 
 If you really wanna read Cioran, start with something like "Exercises fo Admiration", "Treatise on Decomposation" or "Admirations and Anathemas". "On the Heights od Despair" is a too young and too pesimist Cioran. It is a half-Cioran 
 I'm sorry to report that this book merely presents an outline of steps to take, along with a collection of document templates, neither of which contain any actual "content".  In other words, it tells you "what", but not "how".  If you're looking for insight and real-world examples, look elsewhere.  I couldn't justify a bunch of blank forms and outlines for such a cover-price.  I sent mine back and Amazon graciously refunded my money 
 The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.  In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.  If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.   
 Very poor insight into the Red and White which is why I bought the book.Comes across as a wannabe who could'nt cut it when the going got tough 
 Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time.  The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there.  However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information.  So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a "history buff".  From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book.  The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful.  On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner.  Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book.  However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts 
 If your intention is to pass the 70-291 test, don't waste your money or time on this book. It is an embarassment to the Exam Cram 2 series. It covers perhaps 60% of the test objectives in a very mediocre fashion. (In the future, I will be reading Amazon reviews *before* I buy the book! 
 ...Uldrich makes big bucks on the public speaking circuit discussing nanotechnology...I suspect this book was published for no other reason than to provide some "credentials" to support the speaking engagements...his most recent books published since this one have been one about George Marshall and another about Lewis and Clark -- real cutting edge technology there!...nope, don't buy it 
 Out of 3 books i bought on how to travel with a baby. This one was the least helpful off the 3. It lacked any real information on equipment and packing etc. I found a relatively new book 'Traveling with a baby' to be a bit more informative 
 I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth 
 Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read.  Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic!  manic! manic!  I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm).  Just a little hard to read, but very interesting 
 Yes i have a book report to do on Across five aprils,by Irene Hunt,in my book report i must write what the charachter looks like ,but in the book  it did not say ,it is very hard to under stand please give me all the  information u can thank  
 This is the #1 Worse Song of 2006 (#2 is "SexyBack" by Justin Timberfake). For real. His voice is awful and I don't know who is worse: James Blunt, Macy Gray, or Shakira. Imagine the three of them doing a performance together on a stage. It would be pure he11 
 I am fairly new to the P-Funk experience (less than 5 years), but I do know Funk. I bought this DVD with high hopes and expectations, especially Maggot Brain, which is one of my all time favorite live songs. I must say I was greatly disapointed when I watched it. Not only does the song lack the raw power and heart-felt intensity it was originally created with, but the lights and (attire) don't set you in 'that' mood. As others have mentioned, it is good to see George in 2004 performing, but I feel that he should have stopped performing about a decade ago. Furthermore I was insulted that he would dare attempt to fuse rap/hip hop with funk, but a step further, to dare say "welcome to the world of funkadelic". Do not be fooled, this is not Parliament nor is it Funkadelic... If you want real funk, look elsewhere as in Mothership connection, now that is Funky. Don't waste your dollars unless you enjoy hearing old classics butchered by "funkadelic".  - A Very Disapointed Fa 
 Bill Barich's slim volume, The Sporting Life, was a monumental disappointment.  A review in the San Diego Union compared this book to A River Runs Through It.  I disagree...lustily.  I'd like to toss this book  into a river.    A book about horse racing, boxing and fly-fishing...three  of my favorite vices inside one set of covers.  But each of these essays is  merely warmed over gruel.  The boxers are long retired, the horses don't  run, and the fly fishing stories are merely tedious.  You have the feeling  that Barich collected a handful of articles that were so poor no one else  would print them and then foisted them on us.      It's a truly dreadful  book.  Don't buy it 
 Evidently a lot of people love this man's writing, but they must be loving something else because this book is about worthless. Forgetting the issue of PC-ness he broaches by having an Arab-American as the terrorist of the title, it's just not very likely. Other reviewers have said that he chose this character as his instrument to reflect on the state of America today, and his origin serves solely as a plot device to cause his disaffection with this society. But I think if that's the case, it's a weak and unnecessary device, given that there are plenty of Americans who are as disaffected and more prone to violence than some half-Arab New Jersey teenager. As a matter of fact, although it's a topic not often discussed, the main terrorist threat in America comes from white Christian extremists. These people aren't even theoretical; they've actually been responsible for real terrorist acts all over the United States.  Be that as it may, Updike is one of the least astute character writers I've ever read. If anyone reading this doesn't like that assessment, I suggest picking up Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" or "The Brothers Karamazov". Now that's some character writing. I just felt like he endlessly described people's outsides and never touched their insides. It's a book, which means that you have the ability to show the reader the thoughts and feelings of a person, but not to adequately depict their facial expressions or colorations (in other words, it's not a picture). And yet he rarely took the opportunity to get inside anyone's mind, even the main character Ahmad's. And what little internal narration he did give Ahmad was pretty much the same thing over and over again. As for the other characters, he may have intended them to be mockeries of real people instead of making them real people, but if he was doing that I certainly didn't pick up any hints of satire to clue me in. The whole book was dead serious, and dead boring.  I tend to lump all books into two main categories: they're either about the characters or the plot. Given that the characters were such a failing in this book, you might be tempted to think the plot redeems it in some way. You would be wrong. The story itself advances slowly with about three-fourths of the book being wasted in unnecessary build-up (which would be fine if there were decent characters, but as it is...). The climax is so anti-climactic it actually made me sleepy. There's absolutely no payoff in the end.  If you're a fan of this guy, perhaps this book could work for you. For me, it was an unfortunate reading choice and a complete waste of time. If you want to read books about domestic terrorists that are just as implausible but a lot more exciting, pick up Tom Clancy 
 If you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS. They denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage (even though the modem wasn't hurt?) 
 My Iraq-bound son shelled out his hard-earned cash to buy this as a book-on-CD for us to "enjoy" on the ride home when we visited him prior to his deployment.I wish there was a way to get his money back!  "R is for Ricochet", is a truly abysmal addition to the alphabet series. I realize that some of my criticism might have more to do with the delivery by Judy Kaye ... but after reading many of the other reviews, I doubt it.   If you think that endless filler (think high school student with a 3,000 word essay to write) is tedious while reading it ... try having it read aloud to you. *groan* I can't tell you how many times we made the hands rolling "GET ON WITH IT!" motion.  What on earth happened to the feisty, risk-taking, down-to-earth, no-frills, take-it-on-the-chin heroine we know and grew to love? Kinsey Millhone is utterly unrecognizable in this story. Here, she is wimpy, gullible, tentative, and full of teenage angst, a regular worrywart. In fact, she is downright stupid in many scenes.  Her alleged "friendship" with the ex-con Reba, was laughably contrived. They have zero in common and Kinsey is ten years her senior. Reba was a totally unbelievable character ... one minute a train wreck, the next ... brilliant star detective.   As for Kinsey's new romance ... oh puh-leeze! Sue Grafton was so obviously trying to imitate Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli. Why on earth would clothing-challenged Kinsey fall for a snappy Italian dresser in expensive designer clothes? So NOT her type. How would she even recognize these designer clothes for what they are? The Kinsey I know would have commented that the guy looked "good", period! And don't even get me started on the girlie clothes shopping scene. Kinsey ... you used to have a backbone, what happened?  Finally, I totally concur with those who wondered where on earth the title "R is for Ricochet" fitted in!? A cut-and-paste "mystery" that Sue Grafton should have been ashamed to put her name on.  Skip this one for sure ... I was so disappointed with "R is for Ricochet" I doubt I will ever pick up another Grafton 
 I have waited with barely contained anticipation for this book, only to be disappointed.  The first half was mostly very wordy, minutely detailed descriptions of barracks talk, how to march in review, what they eat/drink, discussions between various officers, etc.    When the story did finally get to some action, it wasn't much and not what one expects, even given the few hints in the first half of the book.  Also, I find it ludicrous that a government would try to keep the skinks secret from the governed.  I'm always very irate when an author or even someone in authority cites the possibility of "panic in the streets" as a reason for secrecy.  I doubt that very few of any populace would run into the streets, rioting and looting.  Rather, they would pull together to face this new threat to their collective civilization.  Throwing citizens into lifetime imprisonment, either military or civilian,  for knowing even a hint of these aliens existence, is a crime in itself.  That is totally outrageous government behavior  Not to mention letting their families and friends thus believe they are either dead or "missing in action".  That portion of these books is, I believe, very, very unbelievable.  It was a fair story, a somewhat quiet story, given it's military trend.  Even Sgt. Bass was treated as a minor character, once the "action" started.    However, it is a part of the series, and as such, should be read by anyone who is following these marines.  I await the next book and hope for some more of the "skink war".  If the government insists on keeping the existence of the aliens such a secret, other vulnerable populaces and planets are left without a clue to even be looking for signs of a skink presence on their world, so as to defend themselves and/or be alert and prepared.  I love these authors works, and am sorry to be somewhat down on this particular book, and will happily await the next 
 This book is like reading a trashy tabloid - lots of flashy big colour photos, low on substance. Obviously trying to cash in on current interest in forensics, each chapter is poorly written and is accompanied with 3 or 4 case studies.  The material in each chapter seems to be just common sense any adult could write about after doing minimal research and the case studies are too short, repetitive and sometimes don't even make sense.   Very disappointing. I suspect this book is intended for age group around 8-15 although it never says this anywhere 
 Having heard so much about this revisionist school, I was propelled to read this book.  Such unscientific biased absurdity certainly has some motive behind it. Interestingly enough, many of the details within could be used as a treatise behind Herman Goering's testimony at Nuremburg that the extermination of Jews, gypsies and countless others never happened. They merely died of starvation in war-like conditions.  This book ignores detailed existing records that document orders and transport of Zyklon B for the vast death camp complexes.   How can one even concoct theories like those within when there are still numerous witnesses alive who watched Jews enter the gas chambers and then retrieved the bodies? (Sonder Kommandoes). Perhaps the eyewitness accounts of Jews are not admissible evidence to these "scholars"?  With regard to the author being persecuted and driven from his  country, I have no compassion since he and his family, unlike millions,  were spared their  lives.   My immediate family includes survivors who witnessed the Holocaust with their own two eyes. Isn't is a great coincidence that their stories all coincide with  hundreds of thousands of other victims? Were they all given a Holocaust Mainfesto after the war's conlusion?       
 I was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes.  If you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand, manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit.  I found it to be off-topic for me as I was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who Think for a Living rather than their managers. 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 I love history and am a history minor, and yet I had a hard time reading this book.  It did not devote much time to the Twenties or the Great Depression and spent too much time on the 1940's and the cold war.  I had the opportunity to read the fifth edition of this book, the 2004 edition, and the fifth edition is far better.  It appears to be completely rewritten and makes more sense.  It also spend more time on each area of history.  The fourth edition, to put it bluntly, stinks 
 I liked my Honda factory navigation, so I bought the Pioneer AVIC-N2 for my BMW.  Since I could not found a demonstration unit, I bought it based on reviews and thought most of the navigation system will be similar.  Now that it is installed, I quickly realized that it is a terrible navigation system.  The AVIC-N2 does not allow the driver to change the destination or use majority of the navigation functions while the car is moving.  Now I can NOT map to new locations, redirect to new routes while in traffic, find restaurants, locate point of interests in the area, and many other normal navigation functions unless I PARK the car first.  I called the Pioneer customer service and found them to be very non-responsive. The representative insisted that it is a "safety" feature.  In summary, I would not recommend this unit to anyone.  It is not much different from Yahoo Map.  
 Although the information in this book may all be factual, it is the most poorly written textbook I've read. I'm a professional proofreader and lifelong (60 years) student of writing styles, as well as a writer of newspaper and magazine articles. These authors violate just about every tenet of good style there is. The short list includes extreme unnecessary use of passive voice, poor word choice, ridiculous repeated statements of the obvious coupled with unexplained use of arcane terminology. I'm using this as the required textbook in a course in Industrial Safety, or I wouldn't bother finishing it. I blame the publisher for poor editing as much as I do the authors. I will grant that basic explanations of safety terms and government regulations do not make for compelling reading, but there's no excuse for using what I call the "--and then also too--" school of expository writing. Moreover, I object to the extended use of the Herbert Hoover doctrine of economics ("When a lot of people are out of work, unemployment results") and the Edmund G. Brown theory of social relations ("The burden of poverty lies mainly with the poor.") Maybe this is the best book available on this subject; if so, we have a desperate need for someone to write another 
 The picture shown on the package is not on the sheet set. It is the picture that is on the comforter. Because it was on the package, I assumed it would be on the sheets. The picture is of figures wielding lightsabers. Only the pillow case had this.  I was very dissappointed as this was a gift for a grandchild.  Sandra LaPort 
 This is essentially a Tim McCoy film and a darn good one, too. The "Duke" has a minor, supporting role in it, due primarily to the fact that Columbia's Harry Cohn didn't like Wayne and was giving him bit  parts. He later "escaped" to Mascot where he made three serials  before landing the Western series at Warner's. And of course, the rest is  history. The "Duke" also had a minor role in another McCoy film,  "Two Fisted Law," both released in l932 
 I made a mistake in buying this item thinking since I had one when I was little it would be similiar.It is not,the edges are stiff and strings are pulling out.The fuzz all over the blanket gets all over your sheets.It is a raggedy sorry substitute for my cozy soft one I remember 
 Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price. 
 Recently received this for our 5 year old and I really cannot recommend it to anyone. Master Mind is a terrific game concept for developing logic, but this version of the game has a few problems. The most important is that, at the slightest bump of furniture or board, the game pieces do not stay in the shallow indentations on the board. Game over. It's really that simple and pretty much that inevitable. Also the scoring peg tray overflows into the secret code location so that every time one digs out a scoring peg a wave of pegs flood the secret code cave. Other comments: the pegs for scoring and the pegs for color coding are not too different in size, and both come in red. The pink is light purple and there is also another purple - confusing to small kids.  If you know original Master Mind, you'll know there's a 4-peg code, and scoring it is such that the "code breaker" doesn't know *which* of his colored pegs is in the correct spot or the correct color. Kid's MM has 3 peg codes, but the scoring indicats *which* peg is in the correct spot and which is the correct color. Thus after a few plays it is close to impossible for a child who "gets" the trick to not guess in about 3 rounds, and it seems to discourage the logic exercise since the feedback from any old guess will do just as well. What I'm trying to say is that even if the gameboard were well designed I wouldn't recommend the game for kids over 5. But given the tendency for pieces to fall over, I would send the manufacturers back to the drawing board 
 This is a tiny book (1" by 1") with an abridged version of the text.  This was not evident from the description.  It would be a good Christmas stocking stuffer but was not useful as a textbook. 
 The first few Alex Cross novels were really quite good.  But for some reason, beginning with Violets Are Blue the quality of the stories began to deteriorate, becoming worse and worse and worse and worse.  The plot of Violets Are Blue is disjointed and full of holes, and the writing is juvenile.  Please don't waste your time or money with this book or any subsequent Alex Cross novels.  I purchased and read them all.  The first six Alex Cross novels remain in my library.  The others have been recycled

 Sarah Weddington's book accomplishes a fascinating task - it makes its boastful author appear as one of the great, noble feminisits of the 20th century yet there are so many apparent contradictions within the text that deserve recognition. First Weddington explains that she recieved an illegal abortion in Mexico, yet in Marian Faux's book "Roe v. Wade: The Untold Story of the Landmark Supreme Court Decision that Made Abortion Legal," Weddington--who was personally interviewed--tells the auhtor that she never had any firsthand experience with abortion, and thus, her role was solely ideological.   Furthermore, in "A Question of Choice" Weddington explains that the Roe affidavit never included HOW Roe became pregnant. According to "Won by Love," however, which was written by Norma McCorvey--aka "Jane Roe" of Roe v. Wade--HOW the plaintiff became impregnated, through gang rape, was the biggest LIE INCLUDED in the Roe affidavit, utilized to win the landmark decision.  The writing isn't the worst, but the uncanny bias and its byproduct - numerous unavoidable contradictions - are impossible to ignore, forgive, or accept. What a disgrace to American history. The fact that this book is selling for less than a quarter may yet in itself be the vital proof of its factual irrelevance.   
 The worst part of this purchase was that it was a gift and sent to another persons address. That person now gets a  slew of catalogs at their address with my name on it. (They also get a second copy of the same catalogs with their name on it as well.)   Be prepared to have your name and address sold without permission if you do business with this 3rd party company. Bad business and aggravating 
 Don't buy the widescreen edition of this dvd!!  I purchased the 'full frame' version of this movie a few years ago and recently discovered the 'widescreen' version and bought it right away.  As it turns out, this 'widescreen' version is actually just the full frame version with the top and bottom completely cut off to make it widescreen.  There is no difference between the widescreen and full frame version dvd's except the widescreen has the top and bottom cut off.  Get the 'full screen' version instead 
 Be warned. If you're looking for the exciting true story about how one man revitalized a city in decline and truly modernized Las Vegas through vision and guts (as I was), you won't find it here.  This is not a book about Steve Wynn transforming Las Vegas. This is a tabloid hit job written by a hostile author who has only one objective: link Steve Wynn to the mob.  As a Vegas history buff and as someone who's interested in Wynn, let me concede the author's objective up front: okay sure. Of course Wynn knows mafia wiseguys. How could he not? How could Wynn arrive as a young man in Vegas in the 60s and climb the ladder of influence without making mob contacts? The mob ran the town! The only real surprise as far as I'm concerned is how little Wynn seems to be involved with the mafia.  It's not that I'm a huge fan of Wynn, and all of Smith's secondhand accounts of Wynn behaving like a spoiled brat in private seem plausable, but since it's so obvious that the author  is laser-focused on smearing Wynn, who's to say I'm getting a balanced account?   Whole chapters are devoted to little more than proving that Wynn is friends with this particular mob middleman, and on this particular day in 1982, they were SEEN HAVING LUNCH at this particular bistro. Though Wynn would always deny that the lunch took place, that's not the recollection of this busboy, who we've  tracked down, who was ACTUALLY THERE. etc. etc. This is the book.  I was most looking forward to a retelling of the story of how Wynn built the Mirage. Where did he get the inspiration? How was it financed? How did he pitch it to investors? How did it get built? What were the expectations? How was it received when it opened? How did it change the texture of the strip? We get none of that. Instead, around two-thirds of the way through the book, I turn the page, and the Mirage is suddenly there, no discussion, and we're hearing about how one of the casino hosts may have had mob ties. Weak sauce.  Look, maybe what Smith needed was an opening chapter stating what he was trying to achieve. He could have made a case that although Wynn has transformed the city and done some great things, he's not completely squeaky-clean and has gone to great lengths to hide his association to organized crime. He could have made the moral case about taking money from the mob, and then said explicitly that the purpose of the book was to air out Wynn's dirty laundry and to take the man down a notch. What we get instead is an account of Wynn that purports to be evenhanded and journalistic but is truly only interested in smearing the man.   If the popular positive image of Wynn as humanitarian and brilliant entrepeneur who saved Vegas isn't wholly correct, then Smith's problem is that he goes directly to the opposite extreme, painting Wynn as a greedy, slimy criminal. Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle? Maybe that's a book I would want to read 
 The topic is too abstract for my level. SQ is hard to measure. People with a strong religious background might find this book more informative. I prefer concrete theories 
 This book has about 50 good pages when they're talking about exploration and ecology of pretty much any entirely underground environment, underdark or just really dark.  Some of the monsters -- undead swarm? kuo-toa leviathan? -- are also pretty nifty, though most aren't that great.  The usual spattering of new magic, races, feats, and prestige classes are marginal and probably not worth the bother of inlcuding in your game, espeically if you're not building a new excluisively underdark campaign.  The regional info is where this book really disappointed me -- they did cross-marketing with the War of the Spider Queen series, inserting spoilers for book #3 right in the middle of a rulebook.  (I'd already read it, was disappointed with it, and even more disappointed when most of the plot advances were summarized with two paragraphs.)  This cross-marketing during Lolth's silence made the "Arachnomancer" prestige class stand out as spectatularly dumb -- either the regional information is wrong or that PrC is really pretty de-valued from the get-go; either way you're shelling out money for both the PrC and the regional info.  But the information on the ecology of the underdark is why I got my copy of this book.  I just can't recommend that anybody pay full price 
 While Santelmo's book is valuable for all the interviews with early GI Joe creators, collectors who have not had experience handling rare items can be easily misled by the many photos of so-called "prototypes" which were "re-created" for the book.  Because the "re-creations"  are not clearly marked  there is significant concern that when these surface in collecting circles they will be thought authentic because of their association with the book.  The price guide is also virtually useless as it undervalues some very rare pieces and wildly overvalues some more common ones.  Buyer Beware 
 Unless you are a first timer to the area this book will tell you very little.  While the information regarding the area (complete with maps) can be helpful the information on new restaurants and hotels is non existant.  (I notice they didn't list many resorts including the well known Palace properties).  This can help you with local things but use some other source for where to stay/eat. I also found the web had more information then this book did.  The only difference I can see with this book was that they added "great websites".  Which really consist of about five very generalized sites.  If you want an overall view it is fine.  If you want detailed info (where to eat, where to stay) I would suggest another publication 
 I just finished passing my A+ exams today, and I must say that this book was definately not much help.  Overall, as a review, perhaps it could be considered useful, but only to someone who can spot the errors.  There have been several reviews already pointing some of these out, but there are more dealing with file system types supported by which operating systems, etc.  As another reviewer pointed out, I think the cheat sheet is useless as a cram tool.  Also, the CD did not contain all of the materials listed in Appendix A, and the test engine interface was pretty cheesy, with absolutely NO graphics or picures.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody who is seriously studying to pass their A+ certification exams!!!  For my recommendation, go get All-In-One A+ Certification Exam Guide by Michael Meyers ... it's the only way to go 
 THE Beat Poet fails to deliver once again. i seriously don't know where this man's fame comes from. it isn't his poetry (with the exception of Howl and a few other poems). there really isn't much to say about ginsberg's work other than it is bad. maybe if he had spent a little time in revision he could have done better. you're best off with his selected or collected poems 
 WARNING!......This collection IS NOT the soundtrack for the film (which indeed is AMAZING as I have seen it twice).This collection is nothing more than a compilation from Sparrow that claims that it is "inspired BY the film " The film was made to help sell this collection.( This disclaimer appears at the end of the film.IT IS VERY MISLEADING!!!)None of these hymns appear in the movie.The film has it's own soundtrack and the ONLY song that is in the film IS "Amazing Grace",once sung by Ioan Gruffudd(first verse only);once sung by the congregation  at his wedding(first two verses)  and again at the climax played by the Royal Bagpipers.THE MOVIE IS WONDERFUL,BUT as collection of hymns,alone,this  is nothing special or AMAZING at all.THIS IS A SELLING PLOY!!!-sorry 
 Please do not waste your time with this book.    Yes, it does have many of the "Fantastic Inventions" of Nikola Tesla in it, but there are only pictures of the patent drawings with no explanations offered.  Some facts are present.  Some outright fables are present also.  In summary, Mr. Childress cobbled together this book and seeks only to divest you of your money.  You won't learn anything of substance.  Instead, purchase and treasure, "Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla" by Marc Seifer.  See my review for this book 
 This book reputes itself to tell the secret history of British media baron Mr. Maxwell.  A better account and although a work of fiction a more plausible account can be found in Mr. Archers `The fourth of Estate'.  Maxwell had connections with Israels Mossad and he did have many high level contacts in Israel and he was involved in dubious behavior with the Russians but this book goes one step to far and simply creates relationships that did not exist.  Beyond Muckraking this book is mostly fantasy and conjectured accusations that for the Maxwell hator or for the uninformed may well seem accurate but the truth is far more likely to have nothing to do with Maxwell being murdered by the Mossad.  In fact Maxwell simply failed in business and probably committed suicide.  This is an interesting account but should be read with an eye of suspicion 
 Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').  But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.   Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clichéd sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché?  Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.   We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters. 
 Almost every character in this book is unlikeable, unbelievable, and leads a life of unremitting misery, to no end.  Morris gratuitously gives even her most minor characters sickening motives and gross stupidity.  Morris writes well, but her vision of reality is badly flawed.  The book is a mess, so depressing that, thank God, by the end it's almost laughable.  
 Oh my, what can I say about this whispery little train wreck.  It's third-rate coffee house music that struggles to be heard over conversations (as it should be).  In the quiet sanctuary of my den, it's revealed for all it isn't.  It isn't clever, musically or lyrically, and just drones along seemingly forever.  My audiophile friends would like it because the sparse notes and little extraneous noises would make their overly analytical and fatiguing systems sound magical.  Unless you're into performances that sound influenced by heavy doses of thorazine, don't bother 
 I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.   Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself.  I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book 
 I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row.  I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks.  
 ...that Robinson's latest books have become as pedestrian as this one.  I found the plot uninspiring at best, and completely devoid of surprises.  All in all, one could skip this entry and not miss a thing.  As always, Robinson is a good writer, and he's brought Banks to an interesting -- albeit depressing -- psychological place, but one can't help but feel that he and the series are simply treading water at this point.  If only the entire book were as brilliant and incisive as the very last line.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one 
 Why would you want this item? Amazon is charging $50 MORE on this item than the 2nd Generation Shuffle! And, according to what I have read, THIS Shuffle isn't very derable. It doesn't even last a year! I don't know about you, but I'LL get a 2nd Generation Shuffle 
 Somewhere during the Anita Blake series, Laurell K. Hamilton decided to change the focus from horror/fantasy to sex, all the time and everyplace. With the newer Merry Gentry series, she cuts right to the chase.   "A Caress of Twilight" doesn't bother to follow up on its predecessor's sex-choked promise -- okay, we've got scheming and magic and urban fairies. But the second book only brings up a few interesting plot points, before tossing them away in favour of Merry's latest quickie.   In the previous book, faerie princess Merry Gentry is given a challenge by her aunt, the Queen: If she doesn't produce a kid before evil cousin Cel does, then Cel gets the throne. Outside the bedroom, however, things are getting messy: A mysterious force has left hundreds in California dead, and Merry has to find out why and who.   Coincidentally, an L.A. actress/fay-in-exile is seeking Merry's help for something that might be dangerous for them both, even as Merry learns that a bizarre, ancient power has been unleashed for murder. And what's more, Merry's very presence is beginning to awaken the godlike powers that the sidhe thought they had lost.   There's no point in beating about the bush -- this isn't a sex fantasy for the readers, but for the author. At least 90% of it is about sex in one way or another, and it's all centered on the beautiful, sexy, superpowerful, divinely-chosen Merry. Yes, it's really that bad.   Hamilton does reveal some interesting facets in this book, with a few new twists on the urban fantasy genre. The idea of the Starving Ones is simply astonishing. But none of those ideas are done justice here, because of the lackluster plotting and terrible writing. She repeats her own phrasing endlessly ("Hey, that sounds cool! I should use it again"), especially in the oddly dull sex scenes. They're explicit, yes, but also clinical and weirdly passionless. And sometimes simply weird.   Another example: her sexy male characters look alike -- flowing rainbow hair, odd colouring, poetry-laden powers. This would be okay, if they had individual personalities. Which they don't -- in fact, as her harem grows, the guys blend together even further. For that matter, they don't really do much except service Merry every so many pages.   Merry, of course, is the worst of all. She's an obvious fantasy alter ego for Hamilton. She's also chosen by the goddess, gauns superpowers casually, has every man panting with lust, and is (as Mary Poppins says) "practically perfect in every way." For a better writer than Hamilton, such a character might be appealing -- but Merry's arrogance is just nauseating.   "Caress of Twilight" is a cold caress. With lackluster writing and a heroine you can't help but loathe, the second book of the Merry Gentry series doesn't bode well for the future books 
 TIME has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage, and recent years have only accelerated this trend.  In the 60s and 70s, it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative), but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance.  As for its being part of the "liberal" media, this is inaccurate.  Recent coverage of the (2004) election has attempted to reduce the Democratic candidate to the status of a non-person.  The first debate between John Kerry and George W. Bush was not even covered, except for one very brief article listing a few "fact check" points.  Instead, the cover story wa about new products and movies, a kind of Sharper Image catalog Lite.  TIME also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in Afghanistan.  It was mentioned in passing in another article about the U.S. election, but I would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine's ignoring a signficant world event that George W. Bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office.  In my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment.  The bias seems to be in favor of Mr. Bush, but it's still mostly bland and superficial.  Your money is better spent on the British magazine "The Economist" which is far more substantive.  While its editorial viewpoint is conservative, it's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in U.S. politics.  "The Economist" also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest I've found to a (dare I say it) fair-and-balanced approach to the news.  TIME can still be entertaining to read, but I wouldn't take what they say too seriously.  They tend to bend with the political wind 
 Mr. Neuharth is indeed a sad and cynical man. He equates 'elitism' with critical thinking and casts himself as a man  of the people, just listening to their opinions via his polls and town meetings. And yet he talks of his fancy jets and other staples of his lavish and selfish lifestyle 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 Signs that you are about to make a bad purchase.  1 star is the highest rating. I of course didn't read anything. I saw the show on Cartoon Network and immediately ran to Best Buy to purchase every DVD available in the series.  Funny thing is, there was a gap in the display where volume 4 would've been.  I shuffled through the box covers and found a 4th different cover.  Finding no other volumes I took to register took the dvds home, only to find out I had purchased volume 1,2,3,and 5???? watched 1-3 immediatley.  Can't break continuity, must proceed to another store to buy volume  4. Get to store and hmm...Volume 4 Recollections???? Okay maybe they have 1 recap episode, it happens.  Get home look at back of box.  This is the same description on volume 2???  And my soul was consumed as I broke the seal rendering the disc completely unreturnable and discovered the awful truth that THIS WAS A 4 EPISODE RECAP OF THE PREVIOUS 14 EPISODES.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  OWW OWWW  AAAAAARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Release the hounds of hell on the ones responsible for this abomination.  The show is great. If you want to be cheap just buy this disc instead of the first three, though you will lose the soul of the story.  You have been forwarned 
 This book has a lot of great catagories, but when it comes to actual phrases to use, they come up short.  The phrases are very basic...I didn't need a book to come up with these.  This book lacks detail, descriptive phrases and impact.  I was looking for inspiration in writing my performance reviews - I did not find any inspiration or usuable phrases in this book 
 One of the most comprehensive books on the economic effects of immigration on the native population is "Heaven's Door" by Dr. George Borjas.  Dr. Borjas has for decades been trying to prove the adverse effects of immigration on natives.  Although his research has continued since 1999, "Heaven's Door" is his most recent major work.  Despite the author's obvious bias, the book should not be totally written off by either the pro-immigration or anti-immigration people.  The book is filled with references to studies conducted on the subject.  The author's reporting on the actual factual data is fantastic.  Dr. Borjas claims that his intention is to present the facts and not make policy recommendations.  Both sides can and have spun the facts contained in this book to support their pre-drawn conclusions on the effects of immigration.  And Dr. Borjas himself is included in this group.  One study done of the Mariel boat lift failed to find any adverse effects on the wages of lower skilled workers in Miami.  This was a surprise to most economists.  Dr. Borjas wrote it off.  His reason is that the wages of lower skilled workers in Miami fluctuated unexplainably at another time, and for some reason he feels this is sufficient to ignore the Mariel boat lift study.  But nevertheless, the book does describe the study briefly.  Despite his bias, the book contains relevant information.  But the book does NOT consider all the facts.  First, the book fails to consider the effects of immigration on the immigrants themselves and on their countries.  Second, in his policy recommendations, Dr. Borjas leaves out very relevant policies that could be implemented to alleviate the adverse effects of immigration [for example: policies to improve the productivity of the adversely affected native unskilled workers (merely graduating from high school can increase their earnings potential by 30%).  Borjas ignores this in his policy recommendation].  At the end of the book, Dr. Borjas offers his recommendations for U.S. immigration policy.  He recommends that the U.S. seek only its own interests and the interests of U.S. citizens.  Thus, in his policy recommendations, Borjas ignores any effects, good or bad, that his policy recommendations have on the rest of the world.  Borjas, who at the beginning of the book explains how important it is to be aware of all the facts, ignores this.  Even then, his policy recommendations are pitiful.  He recommends that the U.S. limit immigration to only skilled persons and that no unskilled or lower skilled persons should be admitted.  He proposes that 500,000 skilled immigrants be admitted annually.  The ramifications would be that the wages of skilled workers would be reduced thereby reducing the disparity between the wages of the skilled and unskilled.  He also openly admits that because of the reduced rate of return on education, that U.S. college enrollment would be expected to reduce by 15% and that those 15% would most likely be those that can least afford college.  As mentioned before, he ignores the effects on the rest of the world: that third world countries would lose their most valuable citizens (i.e. brain drain).  So under Borjas's plan, we would import skilled workers and permit our own citizens to do the chump labor.  This to me is pitiful.  A better policy would be to permit unskilled labor to come here meanwhile allocating resources towards improving the productivity of our own citizens.  Low skilled immigrants wash dishes, cut grass and hammer nails (and they're happy to do it; it's an improvement for them), meanwhile, U.S. citizens prepare tax returns, teach college courses, provide medical care and manage Fortune 500 companies.  It's a win-win situation 
 My daughter is two years old and this book helped me normalize my child's behavior. My daughter is my only child so i had nothing to compare her sleeping patterns. However, after reading this book, i understand that i am doing the right thing and that she is a unique and special child. I related to several of the stories in the book and it helped me be more patient and understanding of my daughter. Thanks Dr. Jodi MIndell for writing this book.  
 This book might be good for a person who has no clue of what is Automotive EMC, what is EMC, or/and EMC testing. This book touches many areas in EMC testing, but it lacks deepth and practical examples. It is a collection of many introductory articles around EMC - no orginality. Basically, the high price of the book does not match up to its content 
 I don't mean to sound harsh, however, I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. The title and story line sounded beyond intriguing, however, the book was far from that. I am not quite sure how a person is supposed to learn about the psychology of serial killers in this book when the majority of the book is a compilation of convicted murderers claiming their innocence. Out of the 306 pages and 14 serial killers I found only one to be somewhat informational. Although the testimony of David Gore was at times hard to read I felt that his confessions were the only ones that allowed a person to get another glance into the mind of a serial killer. My suggestion would be to go to the bookstore, find this book, spend a few minutes to read the David Gore letters and then put it back on the shelf before you waste your money 
 I got this book to cook a traditional Christmas dinner for my family and friends, and I was so disappointed. I would not recommend this book. The recipes were not great. The photographs can be very deceptive. The banana pudding was mere mush.The 'yassa' chicken was disappointing and not to mention demoralizing. As a black woman, I am trying to get away from the 'yess sah' notion. Go elsewhere for true Southern cooking. No wonder there are so many of her books in the 'used' section for under $6 
 My main qualm with "Innocence" is that I thought I was going to be reading vampire fiction. It is not. I wouldn't even go so far as to say the writing contains good 'allegorical vampirism.' This isn't the author's fault but more so with the online library directories and book selling sites that push this book as vampire fiction (I don't think Amazon categorized it as this). The plot of the book is boring and unable to relate to. It's about a new girl at high school who lost her mom, classmates commiting suicide, becoming a woman, and the girl's dad's fiance is evil. The other problem I have with this book is the shoddy writing. For example, at the end of chapter 21, Mendelsohn describes the main character Beckett's thoughts on her boyfriend: "We lingered in this trippy, underwater paradise like a couple of dolphins at Sea World. I think, Am I crazy? Am I sane? What's real? What's fake? But the questions rise in bubbles from my head and drift away. I don't want to know the answers." Writing from the perspective of a depressed high school girl doesn't mean your entire book should sound like the contrived attempts at writing fiction from a 10th grade creative writing class. If you want beautiful, delusional fiction, read Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing." If you want good vampire fiction, stick to Anne Rice. I'm just thankful I checked this out from a library and didn't pay to read it 
 This book is listed as a required text for some college studens. however don't buy the book unless you are sure you will use it. i bought it and never opened it. it is still new. and i payed 65 dollars for it. if you  want to buy it email me at Wyzeguy@onebox.com and i will give you a good  deal 
 Proof that anyone can write a book.  Do not waste your money on this -- it is worthless.  You can do better by asking yourself about your time management faults and coming up with your own solutions.  This book has nothing of value.  It is full of typos and ridiculuous quotes. 
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 "Scholars" like Rothenberg love to choose subjects like racism, Native American history, and feminism.  They do this because these subjects allow them to not only feel "multicultural," but to feel as if they are somehow saying, "I told you so" to American conservatives and any white citizens who might feel that racism is overblown.    The fact is, racism is overblown.  Take Hurricane Katrina for instance.  African Americans and liberal whites were screaming, "RACISM!!" after the failure of FEMA to respond effectively to the disaster.  This argument dies when you look at FEMA's response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  That hurricane decimated predominantly white neighborhoods in Miami to the point that the chief of Miami disaster relief, Kate Hale, said, "Where the hell's the cavalry?"  FEMA did not respond effectively then.  In fact, they have never responded effectively to a major disaster.  But, I suppose Katrina is different, right?   Wrong.  Katrina is only one example in a sea of them.  The Paula Rothenbergs of the world like to use South Africa as an example.  They claim that country came together for a national dialog and collectively eliminated Apartheid.  What they fail to acknowledge is the fact that their "invisible racism" is still alive an well in South Africa and always will be.  White South African shop owners still prefer white South African customers.  This will never change, no matter how many books like Rothenberg's are published.  There has never been a society without subtle preferences for one's own race and there never will be.  As long as people like Paula continue to press white people for ever more "progress" on this "invisible racism," they'll merely push this supposed invisible-racism-free utopia further away 
 no monsters in there worth buying the book. Stick with the first monster manual. 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I bought this book because I like to throw my PCs into differing environments to keep them guessing. While it does have a lot of rules for various arid environments and warm wastelands, the book just didn't make me feel hot. The same goes for Frostburn. The book didn't make me feel cold. The only environment book that ever succeeded in making me feel like "I was there" was Dreadmire, by Spellbinder Games.  Wizards needs to take a hint from that book -- it made me feel like I was in a swamp.  Sandstorm offers various rules for wastelands, but it does not offer us anything of real value. We don't need many more feats and skills, if any.  We need substance, and this is a wasteland of redundancy and fluff. If you still have the old Wilderness Survival Guide and Dungeoneers Survival Guide, don't bother with Sandstorm -- most of the rules in those old books are still applicable today 
 I had to read this book for a class in Legal Ethics given by Professor Dershowitz (Dersh) at Harvard Law School. I threw it in the trash when I was done, and for good reason. The topic is interesting, but tired. How do you defend a guilty man? You don't. Unfortunately, Dersh (and, to be fair, many others also) does. The focus of the book is on the ostensibly proper division of a defense attorney between two personas: that of a person and that of an attorney. Dersh feels that a defense attorney leaves behind his personal ethical standards and morals when he takes a case and goes to the edge of the envelope in legal ethics to successfully defend his client. I don't think such a person has a personal morality. If it can be subjected to a second persona, it isn't morality. The worst part of the book is its writing. It is poorly written, poorly developed, and has a completely unbelievable "happy" ending. Dersh had to cater to his feminist viewpoints in the ending and that's unfortunate because it denies his central character (himself) the pain of truly feeling the results of his own amorality 
 It just does not work with Senseo machines. I tried several different grinds and no matter what, water just spurted out the side. I was ripped off 
 If you like to grab a book and take a nap shortly after opening it, this is the book for you. It starts out keeping your interest, but will quickly loose it. If you are looking for a book that really lets you meet York  (which was what I was looking  for), this is not the right book. This book  is a wealth of information, but you will get easily dis-interested, lost,  and confused as the author goes into great depths to introduce the men that  were involved in York's struggles after the war. I was hoping for a book  about York and his family, but was disappointed in this one.  He gives very  little information about York's family life 
 I first read this book over 5 years ago after all of the management of the company I worked for were carted off to the Option Institute in Massachusetts for some management training and they all came back with these books for eveyone to read. I read the book about little Raun and his autism and couldn't figure out for the life of me how this was supposed to help my business succede. All I can say is that after a couple of years of our company from the CEO on down practicing the Happiness is a Choice philosophy and failing to notice real market conditions and corporate failures that the entire company went down the tubes and thankfully the CEO was replaced and others were able to use more standard management techniques. This stuff may actually help little kids who are banging their heads against the wall, but it's no way to run a business and the author is a kook to sell it as a business philosophy 
 Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.   Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40. 
 I used this book for a global operations class.  It contains both text and cases in one book.  However, cases in some chapters do not directly relate to the content presenting in those chapters.  Moreover, some cases are  really difficult to read and understand the context of the case for  analysis.  However, there are some good HBS cases 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 Unfortunatelly, until now I did not received my cd! I guess what happened? Thanks, Octavi 
 From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective 
 I first read Desert Sons because of the high ratings, BIG MISTAKE. I had purchased Into This world We're thrown along with Desert Sons, and once I finished Dessert Sons, I left feeling disappointed deeply at how much of the book focused merely on sex, and how predictable the ending was.   To give myself a break, I decided to skip Into this World We're thrown to take a break from such amateur reading. When I came back to it, I wasn't surprised. I finished it very quickly. There wasn't anything confusing about it. It was terribly predictable.   If you're reading books to learn about the gay life, THIS ISN'T WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT! Mark writes on beautiful events that have the POTENTIAL to be great pieces. But without the details they're nothing but unfinished fantasias. Mark is not a developed writer; his writings are very Un-detailed. I'd like to see him write a more descriptive piece, write something that touches us on levels other that what happens physically.   It seems that Mark limits his characters to what he would consider to be a great person, but these characters seem to be stereotypes, people without deep thought, very immature. Now don't get me wrong, he does address some great issues, and things about the gay life that others might not know about, but I don't feel he does a good job at expressing in detail.   One of the things that disturb me most is how he portrays other characters. He'll make certain people be the "bad guy", and I know that every story usually has a bad guy, but I think that he does a bad job at making people with disadvantages be the bad guy here. For instance, in this story is a boy who was a victim of sexual abuse, even though he turns out to be a jerk Mark doesn't seem to show any compassion on the character. Instead he'll subject the character to the stereotypes, and forever label the character as bad. Just because he was a victim, and he's a jerk, doesn't mean he's heartless, but that's just my opinion. And of coarse he always makes the bad guys have something bad happen to them. But the main character (who makes mistakes just as bad) perfect, without flaw or any bad instances happen to him. He's an angel.   I'm sure this book means a lot to Mark, but it will mean nothing to the reader if he doesn't show us how wonderful it really is. I'm very disappointed with Mark Kendrick's book. It's not my favorite and if you read other novels I'm sure you'll automatically see a huge difference from this author compared to others. 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it.  Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to "save" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable.  Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression?  It truly seems like another writer.  This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity 
 This album is just sad.Sugar ray have always been a guilty pleasure of mine and i'v had no problem admitting I liked them...until now.This album is a big joke piriod.It lacks the maturity of the self titeld and the catchy pop rock of 14:59.Sugar ray tryed to sell out and make bubbelgum pop with this release and faid misurably 
 This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me 
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 The whole game is very poor quality. The spinner is made of cheap plastic and comes apart when spun. You have to apply number stickers to the die. Instructions too confusing for the age group.  Very Disappointed 
 this book is really stupid. who would ever spend money to read this??

 I love Postal Service. So i picked this cd up after reading all of the great reviews. DULL. sorry folks. there is maybe 2 or 3 decent "songs"...but the rest of the cd is just 5 minutes of a syth "warming-up" here and there. oh well 
 I had never owned an All Music Guide and I have been told by fellow music collectors that there are terrific.  Seeing that All Music had just recently published their new guide to R & B and Soul I decided to give it a try.  I must say I was impressed by the extensive detail given to each entry in this book.  You would not only learn the history of an artist or group, but in many cases you got an update as to what the artist was doing nowadays.  This was impressive and distinguishes this book from others I have seen on the market.  The book covers a wide array of genres including rhythm and blues, soul, funk, disco and one of my personal favorites doo wop.   There is one major problem however.  The print is so small that I got a headache trying to read it.  Try as a might I just could not get past this major flaw. I wound up sending it back.  Too bad.  I suspect anyone over the age of 40 will encounter the same problem.  It seems to me that it would have been much wiser to divide this into 2 volumes with print that you could actually read. I would have gladly paid the difference 
 Well, the photos are pretty. Cool idea but, as a Ph.D, I am appalled at the research methods. As a spiritual person, I appreciate what he has to say. Much more below:   My contention with this book is that the research is so clinically unsound, unscientific, and haphazardly rendered that it can bear no weight at all. Also, this seems to be a spiritual book looking for a mystifying way to support the author's points of view about conscious life, while showing some pretty photos garnered from water crystals as evidence. I have Ph.D. and I don't buy it -- pun intended. (Actually, the book was a gift :)   Faulty, unsupportable, unsound, unscientific, and extremnely simplistic research experiments. In one type of experiment, the author writes a word on a piece of paper and tape it to a glass of water -- word facing water -- then wait and observe the crystal formations of the water. He takes photos and concludes that the water is responding directly to the word (and not to him, not to anything else that might be in the environment.   However, there is no proof for the "messages from water" theory provided in this book -- he concludes that water creates certain "peaceful" and "beautiful" crystal patterns for positive words, emotions, and icky ones for negative words, emotions. Furthermore, the experiments did not account for the subjectivity of his own culturally-informed value judgments regarding what is considered positive/negative.   For instance, same example: the water's so-called response to the word -- it could be caused by any number of things, including arbitrariness. Say you go with his theory that water has messages for us, which I believe is not proven by his research, which is not to say it can't be "proven" or that water doesn't contain messages, but this is to say that he fails to consider so many other factors and influences such as:   Is the water responding to the experimenter who taped up the word? Is there a difference in crystal depending on the water source? Real science would have incorporated variables, and multiple multiple repetitions. Variables were not used such as different kinds of paper, different shapes, shades, sizes of paper, different writing/typing styles and sizes, different languages, different kinds of tape, different glasses with the same word. Instead, the author simply accepts as objectively given his own interpretation of water crystals as a true spiritual message.   Further, there is no idication of how many times he repeated the same word experiment? Because without repeat experimentations in a controlled environment, nothing is anywhere near proven. In the book it seems like each experiment is a one-time event and the parts about the crystal experiments read like arbitrary trials -- "hey, let's see how water responds to this word. Okay, now let's try another word. Wow, look at that." This doesn't prove anything. But the photos are beautiful. I'll give him that big time.   The author also fails to acknowledge quantum physics long-accepted breakthrough that an expermenter's own involvement with and presence during research effects the results of the research study? Suppose the water is responding to the researcher himself. Or some other factor. What is the margin of error for these so-called studies? I'd say huge, but the author never bothered to try to figure it out. Instead, we get a "beautiful" little "profound" spiritual book which is *really* about the message of the author, which actually may interest readers, because the message is inspirational and lovely and will make you feel good. (Unless you are is irritated as I am about his faulty water experiments held up as proof.)   The random pairing of water's messages and the author's message, while an innovative approach to draw seekers in and introduce them to his spiritual beliefs/philosophy is a dubious combination. I have no problem with his beliefs, but his attempt to "illustrate" them and concretize them with non-scientifically produced evidence is highly suspect. He has A LOT to say about contemporary issues and the spiritual state of the soul and consciousness, and I think his words would hold more water if he just wrote *that* book, instead of looking for proof for his beliefs in water crystals. His writing and thinking are very clear and his theory of life (not of water crystals) is beautiful and inspiring and mindful. but the two don't go together -- he is forcing them together. The theory is beautiful and fascinating (about the water crystals,) and would be moreso if it were true. But he provides no leaky evidence.   Yes, the water crystals are a lovely additionto the book (I guess they are suposed to be the subject of the book, but his spiritual philosophy is the subject -- they just agument, except that they don't. The experiments he did with water are fascinating. They just provide no evidence of anything other than that water forms hundreds (or more?) of kinds of crystals. But hey -- so do snowflakes. (I have no idea what the estimate is for how many different patterns snowflakes make.) But does this mean snowflakes are talking to us? Are their messages in snow?   This book will appeal to hopeful soulful people, and also uninformed, non-thinking people who will believe just about anything if novel enough -- if it is in a published book format, with photo documenation ("evidence.) It seems to be a "feel-good" book aimed at people who do not think too much and who want to be mystified by the universe.   But on a positive note, the author is a fantastic and innovative photographer, so the photographs are really cool -- an exhibit would be worthwhile. Perhaps the novelty of the chance process of how the crystals formed before the photographs were taken (which words, artworks, music) will appeal even more, due to the unusual circumstances under which these photographs came about. It would make for a great post-modern photo art exhibition and he has exhibited.   Conclusion: Phoney science; no statistics, no margin of error, no variables, no controlled environment for doing the water experiments, no accounting for the subjectivity of the author and his expectations of what he will discover -- for these surely influence what he discovers. As I said, he uses the crystals to prove his theory, but they don't hold up as objective messages separate and uninfluenced by the author himself. Representation is misleading. (In one case water provided a diffent "message" than expected, but the authors found a way to account for this difference in a way that that fit it back into their theory.)   There are SO MANY factors that could be going on in creating the water crystals and the only factor the author/photographer provide is that water has a message for us and that message is readible, and predictable, by them, through its crystals. I think MUCH more research would need to be done -- scientifically controlled with variables and so forth -- in order for his water to support his theory.   On another note, this is a spiritual book and it is interesting and in line with contemporary spiritual, consciousness, intelligent universe beliefs. He is an excellent writer and there are *certainly* "grains of truth" and "nuggests" that the reader can appreciate.   Well, drink 6-8 cups of water a day and think happy thoughts. This will produce positivity in your life and the optimism model and the water requirement ARE proven with excellent socio/scientific evidence.   Two stars to give him credit for trying. He really is intelligent, and his photos are lovel 
 We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time 
 I bought this for my mom and even though she's a big fan she only liked the first 5 songs. The second disk is a complete snooze 
 This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some "weapon" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department 
 I recently purchased this gate, as I needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide. I was so happy when I found this, and for the price! Well, I installed it with no problem at all. But it is not secure. It actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it, the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break. AWFUL and very unsafe!!!  Target.com was very helpful in sending UPS to pick it up. 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 You will find the Ornithologist James Bond's old employer, Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences does not sell copies of this book.  They will sell you Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book instead.  Why?  Because, it is at least from the 1930.  it contains information which is seriously dated.  Not to mention that the pictures are mostly in black and white with only about 10 colour plates.  The pictures that are contained in the volume are not very representative of the birds you will encounter.  This book is acceptable if you intend on bird watching on your caribbean holiday, but we spent much of our time guessing if we were really looking at a bird.  Yes, you can take a book of Eastern US birds with you, but do you want to take a birdwatching library with you on your holiday?  Not to mention there are birds which will not show up in a US Bird book (e.g., bananaquit and parrots).  You will notice that the most effusive reviews of this book come from fans of Ian Fleming's 007, not bird watchers.  That is because this book is much more a piece of 007 trivia than useful to modern bird watchers.  The story of How Ian Fleming's agent was named was that Fleming was at Goldeneye, his Jamaican house, and needed a name for the protagonist of his spy novel.  Fleming wanted a plain name and his eye came upon his copy of James Bond's "Birds of the West Indies", which Fleming described as his bible.  Fleming thought that James Bond would be the perfect name for his spy (No, Audobon would not have been a possibility).  Mr. Fleming paid the ornithologist a dollar a year for the privilege of using  the name James Bond in his novels.  Serious bird watchers are better served buying Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book or James Kavanagh's "Caribbean Birds".  You could also be sentimental and want this because it was what you used when you were young during the period that this version of "Birds of the West Indies" was the only show in town.  In case you haven't guessed, I am both a bird watcher and James Bond fan who owns two copies of this book.  Consider this review with that in mind 
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 5 versions of the same song and amazon doesn't have the 30 sec preview of any of them. sooo it's an import ??? where is the international version of the music video? 
 it makes me feel very hopeless to find that mm is on this soundtrack. i am willing to sacrifice mogwai, +/-, sure, but why did they have to defile mm? WHY? 
 The film I bought at a retail outlet in Spokane WA contains no closed captions!  If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it.  The box should have contained a clear message:  No Closed Captions!  (Parenthetically, Amazon.com's description indicates the film IS Closed Captioned.)    The content of the film is shallow, and it doesn't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported Greenwald film, Walmart, the High Cost of Low Price.  If closed captions are not an issue, however, buy (or rent) *both* films to draw your own conclusion.  Obviously, the truth about Walmart's impact on US cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films.  I found the Greenwald film much more convincing 
 Oh Lord!! Does anyone still read this?? I was a subscriber back in the early 70's,when it was a folded up, newspaper.By and large, Jann Wenner let people run it, that knew how to. It is now, and has been nothing more than an Ad choked,gossiping Teen slick.Right, like they are the ones with the money!! I wonder what they still pay Raoul Duke, to do??!! Ralph Gleason has to be turning over in the grave 
 Having enjoyed "Mr. Darcy's Daughters" written by Elizabeth Ashton it was with great anticipation that I began this book.  I ended the book with great letdown.  While I will not dispute that "flagellants and sodomites" existed during this era, I know it as something that Jane Austin did not dwell on in her writings.  I wish that Ms. Ashton had "kept a good thing going" and continued on more in the keeping of her first book and those of Jane Austin 
 Being a comic book fan, I constantly heard great things about Morrison's Animal Man run but it was really plain. except for the current Mirror Master debuting, the issues fail to get any emotion out of me 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 I purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom. Because of old wiring in the house, the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available. While I use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room, I needed a phone jack so my Tivo could dial out and get programming information. When set up, the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them. I purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that I could use it almost anywhere in my house. After a lot of effort, I find the unit to be nearly worthless.  The range is VERY limited. I made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else (furniture, electronics, etc.) were in the way, yet there was no dial tone. I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to. I couldn't imagine using it with an electronic device (like a modem or Tivo) that sends data. I got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within 15 to 20 feet of each other. Needless to say, with that kind of configuration, it's easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard 
 There are certain unsolved mysteries in life.  The existence of the Loch Ness Monster.  Jimmy Hoffa's whereabouts.  The popularity of the Hold Steady.  I bought this album after various media outlets from NPR to the New York Times fell all over themselves to proclaim these guys the New Saviours of Rock.  I don't get it.  If these guys are the Next Big Thing, then maybe rock and roll really is dead.  Everything about the Hold Steady strikes me as extremely contrived, from the cover art with the guy raising the obligatory middle finger to these pretentious, look-I'm-snarky lyrics.  I'm not sure what this band has to really communicate to American audiences, other than the lead singer's past drug abuse and the standard pop culture references to Journey, Star Wars, 80s bands, etc.  Gee.  THAT'S never been done before.  I'm sure Craig Finn goes into the either-you-love-him-or-you-hate-him category, and I definitely find him to be the most annoying, pretentious blowhard in rock.  I hate him because he seems like the classic poser, and I don't believe he has lived any of the scenes he describes in this record.  There is something about his lyrics that just screams I'm Cooler Than You.  In fact, I'm instantly suspicious of any band that poses for publicity photos holding their Budweiser Tall Boys and high-fiving each other.  I'm getting angry just typing this.  It doesn't bother me that Finn can't sing.  I'm a fan of lots of singers who would never win first prize in a vocal contest.  It doesn't bother me that he looks like Charles Nelson Reilly.  Mick Jagger will never win a beauty contest.  It's what Finn says, and the way he says it that really drives me to stab myself in the eyes whenever tunes like "Certain Songs" start playing.  It's world-weary, but it's a calculated, suburban world-weary.    Musically, the band is tight but derivative.  Sure, "Hostile, Mass" is a Springsteen homage right down to the Clemons-esque sax solo, but why would I go crazy over a ripoff when I already own Springsteen's albums?  There's nothing new being explored here, nothing fresh at all.  It is, however, a primer on how to get in front of the cultural elite 
 This guy is wierd,I don't think he's owned a cockatiel in his life!! Not for the first time bird owner because of all the false info. Why 2 stars? It does have a few helpful tips and some cute pictures.OK to have on your shelf but your going to want a better one soon.(Don't buy his lovebird book either 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The protagonist, Holly, was one step behind the "bad guy" the whole time and never recovered.  There was no great twist in the plot line or the ending.  Many side lines ended up nowhere.  For example, the bad guy has an attraction to Holly and stalks her, but then nothing comes of it.  Holly has a big fight with an instructor and is warned that she might be in danger from him - nothing comes of it.  The dog, Daisy, is constantly mentioned throughout the book with references to her security and guard training - but Daisy never gets a chance to prove her worth - she just chases balls and does her business - no big deal.  A secret offshore bank account of Holly's is given large play in the beginning of the book - but nothing comes of it.  All the FBI's and CIA's mistakes and missed opportunities are overlooked by the big wigs - they are very forgiving - a bit hard to believe.  The story line had potential but the book has the feel of being incomplete and leaves you hanging without that "cliff hanger" thrill that would make it interesting.  As an earlier reviewer wrote - it's pretty much a big yawn. 
 Maybe because the sizing is over seas, but these shoes were too small for me, not comfortable, I was very disappointed. Returned not exchanged because I would try shoes on first 
 Ugh....I never write Amazon reviews, but this book truly deserves a bad one.  I can't believe other ppl gave it such great reviews.  The characters are shallow and moronic to say the very least, Lizzy being one of the worst characters in the piece, and unfortunately the protagonist.  And I totally agree the use of "vereee" constantly got on my nerves, and so did all the brit slang used by these "Americans" (???).  I did not like one character in this book!  What a disappointment...I was looking fwd to a nice fun read. 
 I tried 3 of these DVD+Rs, none of them worked, errors in every burn. I used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly, so it is definately a problem with these DVD+Rs and not with my burner 
 Technically bloody awfull, otherwise great. Was it really worthwhile to DVDize this particular copy?  What has happened to the color version, also with Leslie Howard, that I saw in Zürich in 1946 - 1953 
 I have two previous versions of Case Logic large capacity DVD wallets.  This new one is almost twice as big with only a very slightly larger capacity, plus the zipper gets stuck in the folds and is hard to get out.  There's just no reason for the dramatic increase in size.    Case Logic must have also redesigned the pages because now they're horrible.  I cannot keep the discs in to save my life.  It also has their new binder system that is extremely inconvenient--you have to go through *all* the pages before the page you're accessing--so if you want to rearrange pages, forget it.  I am *so* sorry I bought this book, but there aren't any other options if you have a lot of DVDs.    My advice--find something else.  This thing is a joke 
 The concept that Israel needs a defence for it's existance or "a case for" at all is ridiculous and the title in itself is very revealing since it shows how insecure Dershowitz really is regarding Israel. It implies that a case needs to be made when none is needed! And the last thing Israel needs is to be defended by the someone like Dershowitz, who's long list of clients include- Jonathan Pollard, Mike Tyson, Leona Helmsley, O.J. Simpson, Harry Reems, Claus Van Bulow, Milken, Patty Hearst and Meir Kahane.   FACT: Israel is a nation founded in 1948 with defined borders which DID NOT INCLUDE the Gaza strip, the West Bank nor did it include Jerusalem. Israel acquired these territories after the 1967 War and Israel has no legal right to these occupied territories.  FACT: Due to the 1948 War some 700,000 Palestinian civilians were forced to leave their property and these refugees have never been allowed to return to their property. Refugees from war are entitled by international law to return to their land of origin.   FACT: LAND ACQUIRED BY WAR IS INADMISSIABLE ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. All settlements built on these occupied lands are illegal according to international law. These settlements must be dismantled, vacated or returned.   FACT: Israel has never offered to return to pre existing 1967 borders in exchange for peace in any negotiations with the Palestinians.   The fact that Dershowitz needs to promote lies based on Joan Peter's academic fraud claiming that Palestine of the 19th century was a barren and unpopulated is an embarressment and shows how low Dershowitz will go. Dershowitz tactics in this book mirrors his thought process that he obviously uses in criminal court. But he fails to realize that his readership are not a mindless jury, hand picked and prevented from gaining information other than during court proceedings. Lots of distractions and side issues are offered here but little regarding the facts on the ground related above. Lucky for Dershowitz that he can lie and hide behind a book but had he been forced to actually make his case in a court of law he would lose since history speaks for itself. 
 I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.  Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem 
 This novel was the hardest I have ever read. It was not due to content, but due to the writing itself. Welty's writing reminds of a combination of Faulkner and Chekhov, only without any skill. The characters were never developed, the plot was weak, and the book as a whole was disappointing literature. It turned me off of Eudora Welty completly 
 I read this after enjoying Iles' "Footprints of God" quite a bit.  This is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise.  The book is lengthy, and repeats itself quite a bit (due, I assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters).  Several characters could've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed, but didn't add anything to the story.  Intriguing characters, too - he could've saved them for their own stories.  After wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages, I found the ending itself rushed.  All loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that didn't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far.  There were some aggravating teases, too.  When the Israeli finally gets to confront the Nazi for the question of "why?" (regarding the anti-semitism), I was really hoping that Iles would've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the Nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate.  Nope - he put the question out there and didn't try to answer it.  That's what I was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it's manifested.  All that being said, the last page of the epilogue is brilliant, and in it, I found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord. 
 This was an interesting book about what was going on in the LAPD, but it does not discuss the topics that is titled to.  The amount of information on Tupac is probably one page at most and Biggie maybe four or five.  I felt that Det. Poole and R. Sullivan were more about getting back at the LAPD (not that his information is not valid) than discussing the details about Tupac and Biggie's murders.  This books title should be LAbyrinth:  A Detective Investigates the L.A.P.D.  I don't recommend this book if you are looking for answers or information about Tupac, cause you won't find it.  If you want to know more about the L.A.P.D., this is a great book 
 I got this tooth brush in a gift bag from a party i went to, and when i tried it out, It didn't work! It would play the music for about 10 seconds, then it would die, and i couldn't turn it back on! It went through the whole song maybe once or twice. The music is also terrible quality. DO NOT BUY THIS 
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 This will go against all the glowing reviews on the first four or five pages of the book. I made a mistake purchasing this book.  I don't want to take over the world and I don't want to speak in industry jargon.  I was mislead by the title and some of the reviews that I had read on Amazon before I purchased the book.  I was looking for more of a small scale practical guide to some of the issues a small to medium sized agency experiences.  If you already have a multi-billion dollar agency with thousands of employees this may be the book for you.  However, if you have already built a large successful organization I am not sure why you would want to buy this book 
 THe reviews I read had people saying, "OMG i have no idea what is goign to happen.........blah blah blah." [...]. Everyone knows what is going to happen. Mia and Lilly will become best friends again because they have been through out all the books. I don't think Meg will change that.They will probally become friends again in the next book. As for Mia and Micheal, they will get back together. Meg did not write so many books with them being in love for nothing. Meg even wrote how miserbale they were when they broke up. Tehy will make up when Mia is a senoir.I mean how obvious can it be. I thought this was an awful book 
 This is not some artsy production that less cerebral people can't seem to grasp.  This is just assanine.  Earthworms, bird feathers, daddy proudly flaunting all two inches?  If you don't mind sitting through a a senseless story where a girl (who never changes clothes for days on end) rides her bicycle to a lumber mill every day to stare at some guy who never speaks, then this is the emovie for you. If your idea of a good fantasy is having an earthworm crawl on you or your girl and a feather quill in the (...), then this just may be for you.  This film is mindless.  Watching is a sadistic form of punishment 
 "Wild at Heart" is flawed at heart. It is about the heart of man - not the heart of God.   "Have you got what it takes?" is the recurrent humanistic theme.  The author's psychological analysis of the male psyche is interesting, but its message of "validation" puts man firmly on the throne, and there is no room for that if God is to be King in His kingdom.  It espouses no Christian distinctives whatsoever even though it frequently and selectively misquotes scripture 
 Gee, I guess I really can't rate it.  I ordered it on August 9th, and still have not recieved it as of November 3rd.  Guess I'll know better then to order through Amazon again 
    when the man sings, he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone.  The songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung, If you can call that singing at all 
 While this Modern Library edition is attractively produced, all teachers and students who hope to use it in an academic setting should be aware that this is a severe abridgement--it represents about one-eighth of the original text from 1660-1669.  As a result, there are large gaps in continuity, exacerbated by a lack of editorial notes to fill in those gaps.  Also, the abridgement omits many of the sexiest passages and seems tailored to a Victorian sensibility.  .. 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 I guess I only finished it becuase I always finish a book I start reading (especially if I paid for it).  It was so hard to read, the style is tiring, resembling a ranting inner dialogue more than a book on an economic category, even iof it is from a cultural and anthropological perspective!  At the end of the day I can say I know what Aztecs used for money (and how they tortured children to death as children's tears were considered some sort of "rain magic". damn, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT!!!) and that coins were invented by Lydians (and a number of simiral pieces of information) but I also have a HEADACHE and am feeling frustrated and nauseated and extremely unhappy.  I don't think that is how you are supposed to feel after reading a book on history of money! I don't feel informed or enlightened at all. Having read other people's reviews I guess accuracy of information presented (unless it refers to social or cultural aspects of money) might also be problematic?!  
 How the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me, but there he is. For the most part, Hank sounds like just what he really is, a poseur whining about the trails of being a rich rock star. He does hit the mark on occasion as with `The American Dream' and `A Country Boy Can Survive' but mostly this is just fluf 
 Not impressed.  Purchased due to Jerry Douglass appearance.  Wouldn't even know he was on it.  Bought with Fiddler's Green.  Now that is a nice product, very nice.  Jerry is on it as well, w/Stuart Duncan 
 This item deserves a zero as a rating.  I never had problems with CDs as I did with this 8-CD set.  They refuse to play when you make a selection. When I placed them in multiple CD players, they sounded as if an airplane was taking off. These are very poor quality CDs for $100.  Do not waste your money on this item.  
 For example, William Sidis is described as 'burned out', or unbalanced. At the time of his death - his friends did not think that he was either. He wasn't. He rejected capitalism, for that he is remembered, even in new books - as unbalanced. This author did not do research 
 I'll be sincere.I didn't read all this trash-book.Someone lent this trash-book to me, some years ago, here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.In fact, I read less than 10% of this biblical-garbage. This was a best-seller some years ago, in many parts of the world, including Brazil and USA. Today the best seller is Da Vinci Code.A trash-book so absurd, as this trash-book. Every time has its own trash-best-seller. About a century ago eugenics was fashion.Later came communism, fascism, nazism, ufologism, etc. This bibliolatry is a good book only for morons or atheists.If you are an atheist, this trash-book is a good way to debunk the bible. 
 For those of you put off by the negativity of most of the Amazon reviews of this book, let me suggest one concrete reason why this book is not worth your time. The story of the 2004 Red Sox was a story of great players. Certainly, Theo Epstein deserves much credit, but it was David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez and Keith Foulke and Bill Mueller and...on an on, and most definately Pedro Martinez. A tip off to the problem with the book is to look up Ramirez, Manny in the index. The dearth of references told me immediately that Shaughnessy had not gotten past his personal animosities. On the subject of Pedro, he is pathetic. There are no good stories like one would expect from an "insider account." Yet again we hear how huge the Varitek-Arod fight was. Yet again, he spews about Nomar. A few quotes here and there but mostly a glossy distant portrait by a writer who sounds deeply unhappy. If you followed the season as a fan, you won't learn anything you didn't already know. Stick with the videos until a better book comes alon 
 This book is an excellent example of Politically Correct elitist nonsense. From the PC arrogance such as not just displaying the Enola Gay because the "public did not have an adequate understanding with which to view it" to the ludicrous "connection" of American "homophobia" due the word "Gay" in Enola Gay (!!) to the tie-in with "Rambo" movies and our Vietnam experinces, this book trots out every morally bankrupt Leftist cliche that ever existed, and then some. However, it is an EXCELLENT book as typical of the arrogant PC/leftist mind set and ability to ignore reality 
 Being an art history major and having read numerous books on 17th and 18th art, I found Minor's work to be one of the least helpful or accessible.  He arranges his text by subjects instead of chronologically or by artist or by country.  Though an interesting approach, it makes it difficult to follow the development of the arts through the centuries.  Anyone really interested in Baroque art and culture should look instead to Julius Held and Donald Posner's classic text 
 I have to say that with the exception of the cupid story the over-all affect of this book brought me down.  Granted it wasn't the 100% sex writing that she's turned into, however it was possibly the exact flip side. All the stories together resulted in a sad book.  
 I bought the blue logger and both Street atlas 2005 and SA2005 HH for my Dell X50V. No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows:   1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.  2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.  3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.  4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.  5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.  I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.   I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum. I wish I had read that forum before buying Delorme software. Well, Live and Learn. 
 All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well. 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 The bike I ordered wouldve been a great Christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before I received it, both fenders damaged badly, and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots 
 Argh - hoping to find a good survey of the geologic processes behind the Earth we know today but written for a non-geologist, I found his writing unfocused, tortured and pedantic -especially for someone who claimed to be targeting the geological neophyte.  Just ghastly and dry.  I suspect Mr Fortey's editor was handing out bonuses for using words that only 1 in 3 Phds had any chance of recognizing.  Mr Fortey must have picked up enough money on this incentive for a nice gourmet dinner.  This is an easy book to set aside. Just pick up a college geology text book and you will be better off 
 Our church book study group mistakenly purchased this Bad Girls of the Bible instead of the one by the other author.  While I had great difficulty getting through the first chapter, I am now using this book to improve my understanding of the Bible, and to learn more about ancient times.    This writer makes-up her own story lines, and conveniently leaves out portions of chapters and verses that do not fit her story line.  For example, in chapter two, she states that Egypt where Joseph is held as a slave by Potiphar, is a dry hot land.  Perhaps she should read just a little earlier in the Bible. In Genesis 13:10, we are told different. 10 Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar.  While the ordering of this book was a mistake on the part of the person who ordered the books for us, I believe it is a Godsend for us to read and discuss this book, though I doubt we will actually be using the questions at the end of each chapter.  Instead we will ask questions regarding her inaccurate portrayal of these women and the facts of history. 
 It's been a bad day for me.  I woke up, chopped some concrete blocks in half, ate some granola, and recorded another blues album.  Then someone sent me this, along with a new brush for my pony tail.  One listen, and I cried more than when the reviews came out for Under Siege 2.  The music is whiney and unoriginal and...well, have you seen these guys?  I'd seriously snap their necks in half and compound fracture their chest if I ever saw them and their tight pants in  real life.  Terrible 
 I love the A-Team, but this box set left me disappointed. The description stating Dolby Digital 2.0 for the audio track is misleading since the audio is in mono, not stereo. I was also hoping there would be "some" extras in the set in addition to just the episodes 
 I bought this book for my husband, thinking 'aww' a book especially for him. My husband hated it. And on reading so did I. The author obviously has a very usual relationship with his wife as he often talks about feelings of jealously between them. Its very unusual. For example "when you feel the baby kicks your wife might feel jealous as so far its been her private pregnancy"! How ridiculous how would jealousy ever come into it! The book assumes all men are concerned about is finances - it has pages and pages on money, insurance etc. there is nothing much about the joys you feel as a father. If your husband is kind hearted, honest and is truly looking forward to pregnancy and the birth of his child I would advise not to buy this book. The tone is very negative and some of the statements and assumptions about what "men" and "women", are very generalised bordering on ridiculous ie "your partner might be worried that you're going to leave her" what the heck?. It seems very personally related to the authors experience, and is simply selling because it is one of the only books packaged to be directly aimed at men.  I would suggest the book "the birth partner" it is for men/the partner and is written in a matter of fact and open way (the author is not overly emotionally involved) - getting you to ask questions about how you would feel about certain situations rather than dictating how you do feel. READ THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS AND YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 Without question, a truly awful movie.  Not sure what Daryl Hannah was doing is this picture.  Maybe it was part of her community service agreement with the court.  Jennifer Tilly proves again how annoying and untalented she is.  As for plot, character development, etc, you can forget about it.  You'll soon find yourself rooting for Jason to show up on the set and kill off everyone, including the clueless and dimwitted husband (who is "seeking" his wife, Daryl Hannah).  There is a reason this movie has had at least three different titles 
 Thank you to the people out there specifically rating the edition. The "new" features really do suck. Let the movie companies know you're sick of this re-issue, new edition garbage, and everyone out there keep on giving bad reviews to these crappy "new" editions. Let the weasely bean counters in accounting know that their greedy grab for a profit margin will ultimately turn consumers off from buying their products period. It's certainly given me pause when it comes to buying a new DVD. 
 Actually, some of Farrell's citations did not lead to the 'facts' he claimed in his book.  This is the biggest shortcoming of The Myth of Male Power.  He should be more thorough in his fact-checking next time, because there were quite a few errors in the book 
 Being a specialty roaster since 1975 and being part of a local specialty roaster group. I can tell you that starbuck's main accomplishment is their marketing ability. The coffee they distribute is garbage, and this doesn't have to come from my mouth, it comes from people who come to me after tasting their supposed "specialty coffee."  Starbucks lost their specialty status the moment you could find them on every street corner and/or supermarket. Where they beat most is their non stop advertising and brainwashing of people. The reason starbucks got big was because there was noone around to fill that demand, or more importantly, due to the nature of the specialty market, noone who wanted to fill that position.  The amount of coffee they are forced to produce lead to only one scenario, inferior quality.  Concepts of mass production. Economics 101. The higher the demand, the less likely quality is to have influence. 
 This book is written by Sonia on how great Sonia is. If you are looking for a step by step instruction on how to do your makeup...this is not the book for you 
 I bought this after havinf the Belkin Tunecast II and have to say that i cannot see any improvement. The signal is TOO WEAK....TOOOOOOO WEAK 
 This is the first Moore book I have read. I thought it was ok. The story was pretty original and somewhat entertaining, but I just don't share his sense of humor. I love dark, bizarre humor, and that's what brought me to this book. My favorite author is Chuck Palahniuk, who, as many of you probably know, has an extremely dark and twisted sense of humor. I just didn't think that this book was all that funny. I admit, it did have its moments. There were times that I laughed pretty hard at this book, but these moments were few and far between. I saw many moments where this book was trying to be funny, it just seemed to me like Moore was trying too hard. I would be willing to try reading a Moore book again, but from what I could tell from this book, you need a very specific sense of humor to really enjoy this him. It is dark, but I thought it could be really corny and dumb at times too 
 If you really liked JUST WONT  BURN then this could be a  major disappointment like it was for me. Susan leaves the Blues for a smoother sound and leave's the fire and passion behind. Now there's nothing special about her. Susan please go back to the Blues

 This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers.  The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break.  The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing.  It is like the oil in the compass is very thin.  Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading.  Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.   If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva.  For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement 
 Save your money and leave this book on the shelf. This guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. Moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, Peterson's "Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers" 
 This is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself.  This book didn't really make me feel anything. I never got so that I cared about the characters. I never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either.  This is one of the books that you know you read but you just can't really remember later on. I wouldn't recommend this 
 I think the Chinese have developed wonderfully sophisticated systems of Astrology, Feng Shui, and Healing among other things. I'd never come to this opinion from reading this book, however. I found it to be simplistic and shallow in it's content. The delineations are more surface descriptions minus compassionate, psychological insight. If I had flipped through it at a store or library first I would most definitely placed it back on the shelf. Sorry, it just wasn't for me 
 Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous "raunch" button to be successful.  It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement.  While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold.  Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably.  One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try.  Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture.  Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise.  That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity.  Why do we, as audience members, do that?  Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor?  While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.  I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed.  I have to get this first one out in the open.  Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film?  The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish.  Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre.  Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like "This movie is just like Out Cold".  This makes me so angry.  If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, "Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca", instead of the other way around.  Casablanca needs to come first.  With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters.  Were there any?  Great question!  I didn't see any.  Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations.  There were no definitions to anyone.  Sure, one could argue that there were some "characters" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clichés, not characters.  Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest.  Nothing of the sort happened here.  Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois.  Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off.  Again, there was nothing of value.  Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.  If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth.  He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers.  He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead.  Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience.  As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter.  The entire "King of the Mountain" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners.  Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain.  The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk.  The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face.  It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.   Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom.  Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public.  I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it.  It is as if most directors are just using the "cut & paste" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring.  Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.  I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again.  Grade: ** out of **** 
 uh......... no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on.  Whats a sherry and what is an  amontdillo i dont even know. loserbook. Go Central High Footbal 
 The book covers a number of concepts in a broad swath; while the new finance student will get a decent overview with some applications, seasoned users will get the standard fare dished out in elementary finance texts.  Not recommended for anyone with working knowledge of finance 
 This CD is disappointing.  It doesn't even sound like Kenny! 
 Very disappointed in this book-it just asks you to write down how important are various aspects you would want in the college of your choice, but nothing else.  No specific colleges are named or recommended in this book.  The book asks you questions like whether you want to go to a large school or a small school, and after thinking about this and other questions, then you can buy some other book to find out what colleges might fit your ideal college profile 
 Skateboarding could really do without self conscious myth making like this. One part that really got me mad was the film maker saying "These guys were making history every single day!" or something to that effect. Who are the egotistical ones, the filmakers there to get rich and famous or the skaters who made their own decks and skated curbs in the rain for the enjoyment of it? I eventually flicked channels half way through the movie after a piece of dubious editing.  Stuff like this gets in the way of skateboarding 
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 I ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in New Hampshire.  He used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again.  I ordered a replacement, checked it out and sent it on to him, with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use, it quit working. I thought the unit was nice, compact and fairly easy to use, but with two malfunctions in two cameras, I don't think I would recommend this Aiptek model to anyone 
 	I have found this book very difficult to enjoy.  To begin with, the first chapter is spent telling me that I can do it!  The writing is condescending and achieves the opposite of the intended motivation.  The cartoons are stupid and not comical. While reading you'll quickly learn that the author offers a service to you, the aspiring inventor.  Reese, as your partner, will take your idea, help you develop it, package and pitch it, and negotiate the contract.  In exchange you split the royalties with him.  This sounded like a great idea to me: Your idea combined with his knowledge and skills could produce great results.  It's a win/win.  So I looked into his website.  For him to consider your idea, you must pay a 175-dollar fee.  The concept is that this fee is nominal compared to typical lawyer fees.  Its object is to prove that you are serious and so that Reese is not swamped with ideas.   The real payday for Reese is when you get paid too with royalties for licensing your idea.    I am a college student and cannot afford to swing 175-dollars so easily, so I requested that he waive the fee and hear my idea.  I assured him I was serious and that I believed my idea had great potential.  After all, the big money is in the royalties, not the 175-dollar initial fee.  Reese declined the offer.  He said that it would be poor business practice to offer different prices to different people. I am very objective, and I am not offended that Reese declined my offer.  But, to address Reese's inability to modify prices, consider that car dealers negotiate prices, department stores have sales, and of course, Amazon will sell you this book for less than your local bookstore.  I quote Reese from page 68, "While we're on the subject of fees, if the price quoted is more than you can afford, it's quite appropriate to ask if the attorney can come down a bit."         Reese unintentionally enlightened me to the nature of his operation.  The 175 dollars is so important for a very good reason.  The 175-dollar fee may seem nominal compared to the fees of a lawyer, but Reese is dealing with many more clients than a lawyer.  One thousand ideas submitted is worth $175,000.   I know that if you're reading this review you have an idea, you don't know what to do with it, and you can't afford to spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer to find out.  Reese knows this too.  This is perfect marketing.    I'm not suggesting that Reese doesn't do what he claims.  I'm sure he takes ideas and markets them and makes money for himself and the inventors.  However, I question what percentage of submitted ideas he acts on.  If he was successful with a significant percentage, it may have been lucrative for him to at least hear my idea.  The message Reese sent is clear:  The 175-dollars is more relevant than the potential of the idea.              I give this book two stars because I commend Reese for his clever approach at earning a buck.  I feel he is unethical, and he condemns most of his own practices in this book.  However, when it comes down to the bottom line, Reese isn't breaking any laws, and he's trying just like you and me for that million-dollar payday.    
 I bought this as a would-be Christmas gift for my grandson.  I tried it first and unlocked the door using the code given but was unable to re-lock it.  After several attempts to lock the box, the lock jammed and would not turn in any direction and the door would not lock.  Needless to say, I returned it and am presently looking at other options 
 Wendy Doniger has done a disservice to an important Hindu work. She has misinterpreted the work in important passages.   Poor showing Wendy 
 In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it.  It just looks too cheap.  The wooden handles are chipped in some places, there's almost no finish on them, and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking.  Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift 
 i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing 
 I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house 
 Like some books  written slightly about Saddam Hussein this book is too easy on the Iraqi dictator/mass murderer. Saddam's conquest of Kuwait does get some mention, plus the fact that much of the world wanting him to pull out of Kuwait not solely the USA desiring him to do so. But Saddam's ultra-deadly mass murder of Iraqi Kurds (182,000 dead kurds in one year alone) is not illustrated by this author well enough. Nor enough of Saddam's other enormous crimes against humanity are well illustrated here either. Plus there is no mention at all of Khadafi of Libya giving up his nuclear bomb project once he saw the USA and it's allies take Saddam down in 2003 and Khadaffi feared he (Khadafi) might be next to be taken out.  
 Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)  Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:  "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).  I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.  Definitely not worth your time 
 If you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book. It blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve.  example 1. The problem of evil is solved thus: "And God has done something about the problem of evil. He has done the most dramatic, costly, and effective thing possible by giving his Son to die for evil men."  example 2. To John Wisdoms damning parable, the book argues: "For in Christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving Gardener; we have the actual, empirical entrance of the Gardener into the human scene in the person of Christ (cf. John 20: 14,15), and this entrance is verifiable by way of His resurrection."   All of the arguments assume the ignorant position. The argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general. Reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they weren't, we wouldn't be here. Too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there. I'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge.  
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 While entertaining, I found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money. While probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed. I also found the timeline hard to believe. Maybe because I have lived in the area and understand the distances (and traffic) travelled in short periods of time. I am a big Elizabeth Lowell fan  (as well as Ann Maxwell) but this was not one of her better books 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 All these posts must be by people who didn't actually take the time to READ THE BOOK!!!!! All I have to say is that the direction of current flow shown in the diagrams is either wrong, or varies widely between conventional and electron theory. For example, on page I-41 they show electron theory current flow from a battery through a lamp in the right direction (negative to positive), but then later in the section discussing Ammeters pages I-95 through I-104 they consistently show current flow going in the WRONG DIRECTION. Obviously the person who did the diagrams was confused and no one did a good job checking their work. This is the kind of thing that is terribly confusing for a person trying to learn "BASIC ELECTRICITY" and is just plain sloppy. I want my money back!! 
 Like a previous review said this book was very poorly written for the quality of author Mr. Byers is. I was looking forward to this book for quite some time and I have to say I'm very disappointed. The plot was fine but the tone of the story was so....lackluster I guess... that I couldn't stay interested in it for more than a few sentences. I must say that I am a die hard Forgotten Realms fan and that's the only thing that enabled me to finish this book. The very talented Richard Lee Byers usually does superb work but this one was left wanting. Frankly, the characters sucked, the tone of the story and the way it was told sucked and it really could have been told better.  I put this on par with those horribly written excuses for literature that come from the Eberron line. This is the first Forgotten Realms book that has left me really disappointed in quite a few years (since the Pools of Darkness line). As much as I love the realms I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and that kind of makes me sad because I've recommended the realms to hundreds of readers who've instantly fallen in love 
 The movie is fine, but............... There is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format. I use full screen. When I contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen, the response was send it back if you don't want it. I kept it, but was not happy with customer service 
 I was expect high standards from this book given that is was from Sams Publishing, but it looks like no one proof read this book. There are missing or incorrect images throughout this book. When pointing this out to Sams Publishing, they fobbed me off telling me that they would get in touch with the author to get him to send the missing or incorrect pictures. I am still waiting 2 months later. I would say ignore this book, unless it is second edition. I just find it would be a good book, if someone had check it out first. Nevermind, try again. : 
 I really enjoy the Falco novels, but this one was disappointing.  I purchased it soon after it was published, started it, but left it unfinished until recently.  I finished it and started Time to Depart which returns to Rome.  I feel that Last Act leaves much to be desired, but enjoy the other titles in the series.  Keep up the good work 
 I think I would have liked this book if I had read it when I was 14 or 15. Sweet, dreamy, simplistic. But I am much older and I was struck by the inconsistencies: The young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people; the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later - I lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest; the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel (in 1938??). Then there was the secretive, silent, and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked.  I was disappointed in this book. 
 Barbara Branden is a former protege of Ayn Rand.  She is also (as the book amply demonstrates) a pretentious mediocrity who appears to be able to offer the world nothing substantive, save a vitriolic, snotty "tell-all" style blast against her former mentor and supposed "friend".        Barbara should have known that a book like this would be exactly the sort of thing Anti-Rand/Anti-Objectivism/Anti-Libertarian types would love -- a "juicy tell-all" purporting to demonstrate that one of the greatest public champions of socio-economic freedom was really just a shrewish, slutty nutcase.       Branden takes exquisite, almost tragically obvious care to paint herself as the wholly-innocent victim of the machinations of Nathaniel Branden (her husband at the time), and the supposedly megalomaniacal villian, Rand.  Her "sympathetic" portrayal of Rand's husband Frank O'Connor manages to show, instead, a pathetic, drunken schmuck, completely browbeaten and psychologically over-powered by his domineering shrew of a wife.      As with NB's retelling of events in "Judgment day", the Brandens portay themselves as the archtypal "innocent, impressionable teenagers destroyed by the vile, capitalistic evil-ness of Ayn Rand".  The truth is doubtless somewhat less flattering in their regard.       It's very ironic this book is taken at all seriously -- given that at least half of it is almost word-for-word reprint of a biographical sketch of Rand that Ms. Branden had published in the hard-to-find book "Who is Ayn Rand?" in 1968, shortly before the break.    No details of Rand's philosophy are given -- not even in summary form -- with the exception of several long-winded and preachy passages misquoting Rand's ideas, and then denouncing them as "dangerous".       To top it all off, after spending 200-plus pages painting Rand as a deceitful, power-mad poseur, Branden  devotes the end of the book to detailing the tremendous impact Rand's advocacy of socio-political freedom and "rational self-interest" have had on the culture at large.       All in all, this book is an obnoxious attempt by a former "friend" to urinate on a dead woman's grave.     I gave it 1 star, but it deserves far less. 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 This book consists of a lot of name dropping and stories from the world of golfing greats. In the appendix section Dr. Bob Rotella sums up all his golf wisdom in four pages. Reading these pages you get all the information Dr. Bob Rotella has to offer.  For the average bogey golfer "Golf is not a game of perfect" prescribes working on her short game. From my analysis a lot of bogey golfers lack length to be able to shoot greens in regulation. Most of them eliminated double bogeys by working on their short game. For these players this book is no help at all.  I rated this book with one star and not with zero because Dr. Bob Rotella gives one great advice: create and stick to your pre-shot routine 
 I love Pop/Rock so I wanted this CD after hearing the first single "4EVER".  Too bad nothing else on this CD is worth listening too.  The vocals are annoying and the lyrics are even more annoying.  I would not wish this much pain on anyone.  Nothing is very catchy.  I found myself getting irritated because of the whiny voices.  Stay away from this debut with no kick 
  For some reason I do remember seeing this film as a kid, and I thought it was great.  But now, seeing it again, I don't know, I think it's really kinda dumb.  I can't remember what the appeal was back then.  Maybe it was because I thought Carol Kane was hot. And Gene Wilder was still kinda popular at that time.    Try watching this again, believe me, it's not so great.  I should have rented this dumb thing first.  
 Tendentious, elitist and finally, tedious. This book does not reflect a serious, far-reaching engagement with the problems presented by Strauss's thought. 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 Huston Smith's worldview should be obvious to those who have read his previous books, or to those who read this one critically. It is perennialism, not Christianity. Perennialists, such as Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell, and Ken Wilber, hold that all religions share a common mystical  and esoteric core: all is one and all is divine. The exoteric trappings of religion--such as their official creeds and Scriptures--may seem to affirm otherwise, but never mind. (Sadly, the two evangelical authors who endorsed this book either did not understand Smith's perspective or wrongly thought it not significant enough to withhold their endorsement.)  Thus, while using words common to Christian faith and appealing to various Bible texts, Smith redefines the meaning of every theological term he uses and imposes an essentially pantheistic and monistic worldview upon the Bible, adjusting it to his perennialist and Procrustean bed for appropriate mutilations.  Smith's very definition of Christianity (p. 33) lacks any reference to Jesus Christ, the incarnate founder of it. This is because Smith's philosophical categories trump the teachings of Jesus and his apostles.  If one is impressed with Smith's rendering of Christianity or if one wants a truer description of it, it is advisable to read the Bible itself as well as to consider books more faithful to what the Bible's basic message, such as John Stott's "Basic Christianity" and Walter Martin's "Essential Christianity." To understand the tactics that Smith and others use in misinterpreting the Bible, see James Sire, "Scripture Twisting."  I will have a longer review of "The Soul of Christiantiy" published in "The Christian Research Journal" in the near future. 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 Whats the big deal? Neko Case is a great musician in her own right. In fact, her songs were the only ones on the alblum I actually enjoyed. Bones of an Idol is a great song, but I really dont see the appeal of this faceless band. If its rock, then its not very good. I would give them the benefit of the doubt that they are so artsy that theyve come full cirle back to plain, old dirty rock. 
 This book is badly out of date and actually contains wrong and misleading information. You're best off if you look at books on this subject written in the last ten years. 
 yo,i gotta love this,but...my cousin said that before i was born, he had yugioh cards,and he say the one i have right now,these cards back then were expensive. he say konami ruined yugioh?????? 
 I'm deeply disppointed in the direction that William Connolly has taken.  "The Augustinian Imperative" and the "Political Theory and Modernity" were my favorite books about eight years ago.  I was almost a true believer in the William Connolly gospel.  I still believe that the old books are excellent books, but I think he has refused to grow and become enmeshed in a rhetoric that gets dull though overuse and insufficiently attuned to the possibilities of an indifferent universe.   In this book, he seems so concentrated on his war with William Bennett and his views of pluralism that he seems to ignore other possibilities.  For instance, and this is an extremely important for instance, what if a religion preaches war as the way its believers should relate to non-believers?  Should we brush that fact under the table to further our anti-William Bennett agenda?    Another, for instance, what if one is a homosexual?  Is a homosexual really intolerant who doesn't want immigrants in his countries who believe that he should be stoned to death?  Is Connolly in any sense compassionate to teach an ethos that questions the logic of such a homosexual?  Such an ethos may well drive the homosexual into the arms of William Bennett.  Bennett seems more likely than Connolly to return any kisses.  
 These activities are clearly for use at work when you are the boss. Not useful anywhere else. 
 I think a better book on sushi could have been written by a dyslexic ape.  It seems like the author, never having seen sushi, did some web browsing and wrote a book.  There are recipes in this book for PEANUT BUTTER AND  JELLY SUSHI ROLLS.  It's beyond wrong.  BACON, LETTUCE, AND TOMATO SUSHI  ROLLS.  I can only assume this book is someone's idea of a sick joke 
 Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.    Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil & Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils & Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player 
 As title says.  There were kind of a "water mark" on the face of the watch, maybe a leak from the solar panel?  I did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch, no point paying shipping back and forth. Anyways the instructions were easy to understand, buttons on the side a little bit hard to push.  Blue LED on red face looks bad, because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see.  This watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust, I am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 How he gets away with it I will never understand.Orson Welles was a Clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms.(that's what you do when you can't make art)Don't worry,there is always Rossellini,Fellini,Renoir,Bergman,Dreyer... ... 
 Graphic novels are in, and graphic novels about the Holocaust, keying off of Art Spiegelman's MAUS, command our attention both for their subject matter and for the way they present it. Unfortunately, Miriam Katin's WE ARE ON OUR OWN, does not do a good job on either count.   As it happens, shortly before writing this review I spent a couple of hours in a bookshop in New York City that specializes in graphic novels and comic books. I soon realized that most of the graphics in the novels are poor at best. Interestingly, the best ones are done by Europeans who, it seems, are still trained as artists, something that I'm not sure we can say about their American counterparts. Katin's graphics are better than some, but still not especially compelling. They soon lose what visual interest they have.   Nor does the story redeem the uninteresting graphics. As it also happens, this novel is not about the Holocaust, but about the experiences of Katin and her mother, Hungarian Jews who, in 1944, purchased false identity papers and went on the run, staying in Hungary and finding shelter with two or three Hungarian peasant families. In the meantime, Katin's father was fighting with the Hungarian Army. I don't want to minimize the experiences of any refugee when I say that Katin and her mother were singularly fortunate - though occasionally suspected to be Jews, they were never turned in by their hosts; they survived the war and, at war's end, were reunited with Katin's father. They went on to stay in Hungary until 1956, when they left in the aftermath of the Hungarian Uprising.   The title reflects Katin's loss of faith in God, a loss that grew out of Katin's experiences, but the story she presents is simply not compelling. Elie Wiesel survived the concentration camps, the only one in his family to do so, yet he has made his peace with God, and he is hardly the only Holocaust survivor to do that. For far less powerful reasons, Katin wants to share with us her loss of faith, though she could as easily have found the hand of God in her and her parents' survival.   Were it not for the current demand for graphic novels and for Katin's attempt to connect her story with the Holocaust - a connection that barely exists - I'm not sure this book would ever have been published. If you must read a graphic novel that is compelling and is truly about the Holocaust, read MAUS. 
 This book seems hopelessly out of touch with Black culture and US culture in general.  It also seems to be pandering to people who want to believe the Nation of Islam is not different than Hitler and the Nazis! How simplistic!  If you really want to understand race and how to do away with racism give this book a pass 
 Too many characters.  Too vague.  Too bad.  I'm sure this could have really been a great book, however it failed miserably.  Each page I turned, I kept thinking "it's got to get better".  I just finished it.  Trust me.  It doesn't.  Skip this one over.  Pick up Wally Lamb instead 
 In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them.  He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.  If his statment were true, there'd be no way to draw a circle in Adobe Illustrator, but I know I've done that before!  Read this book if you don't know what a computer is and won't mind misinformation presented to prove points that are stupid and worthless anyway 
 To say that Cavell's prose is challenging is charitable, at best.  True, his ideas are solid and any good, insightful work requires effort to understand, but Cavell seems to circle around himself in a rhetorical  spiral of namedropping and navel-gazing with an irksome regularity.  He  frequently explores ill-transitioned tangets with no warning or reason  apprent, and the overall read becomes fractured and one is left wondering  why.  This said, when one can extract the ore of Cavell's reason, it is  pure gold.  Truly, a mixed bag 
 I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as "Little Women."  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as "The Secret Garden" or "Jane Eyre." But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions "Take A Chance On Me" and "Small Umbrella In The Rain" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to "Little Women"- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else.. 
 This book deserves two stars for the message and zero for the messenger. The middle-class is indeed in trouble, but not necessarily for all the reasons Lou Dobbs offers here. It is interesting to note that as host of CNN's "Moneyline," Dobbs was a champion of the pro-business policies that have in great measure led to the pain and suffering of the middle-class. We can fairly ask when Dobbs suddenly "discovered" the middle-class; it seems to have occurred shortly after he discovered the immigration issue, when it was pointed out that many of his guests on his "Broken Borders" had ties to hate groups. Dobbs had to discover the middle-class as a facade around the immigration issue, as a cover to the fact that he was allowing people with ties to or were in fact members of white supremacist organizations to frame the debate.       Dobbs may sound "reasonable" when speaking to Al Franken on Air America, but his written words leading up to the 2006 elections are that of a xenophobe and bigot. Going from the pro-business extreme to the other has naturally led to some confusion on Dobbs part, and one wonders if he is ignorant of the racial aspect of his views or is the slickest snake oil salesman on the planet. So much for the messenger       Beyond that, one thing is for certain: after all these years as being the "expert" on the market, he never seems to have left Wall Street long enough to understand the reality on the street that he now claims to speak for.     One of these realities is than in the "good old days" Americans were over-compensated, and the bubble burst when high priced American-made goods could not compete with low-priced foreign-made goods. The result was lost manufacturing output and lost jobs that never have been replaced to any significant degree, and what new manufacturing there has been have not replicated the same wages There may have been an opportunity to arrest this development if there had been the will to reinvent domestic manufacturing in line of the new realities, but domestic output was ignored in favor of military construction during the critical years of the Reagan administration. Unlike post-WW II, this military build-up did not replicate the level of domestic manufacturing expansion.     Now, it is business executives who are over-paid, and although it is interesting to speculate how many jobs can be created if a CEO compensated $20 million a year makes just one million less, or how much it would increase workers' wages, the fact is it wouldn't be much. Wage redistribution would have to extend beyond the upper class into the "yuppie" class whose best skills seems to be moving paper and talking. By the same token, even if the nativists are correct that "low-skill" immigrants depress wages, we're only talking cents, not dollars--which would hardly propel low-wage workers into middle-class status.  Would raising minimum wage a few pennies do the trick? It is insulting to make such a claim, and furthermore studies have shown that for every 2 percent raise in the minimum wage, one percent of low-income workers are laid-off.     There are myriad other reasons why wages are depressed, such as out-of-control healthcare costs.  But in any case, for Dobbs this is all secondary to the immigration issue, which is mendacious if only for the reason that he is playing a xenophobic political game without accknowleding uncomfortable realities. It is easy to blame businesses for hiring undocumented workers, but the fact is they wouldn't be if they didn't need to, and current immigration law makes it almost impossible to obtain that labor legally. Much of the work that undocumented workers do is seasonal, migratory or otherwise require some measure of mobility, which most Americans are reluctant to do even if housing and transportation was provided by employers. And these jobs certainly do not provide a path to middle-class status.      Having staked his credibility on assaults on Mexican immigrants in league with known racists, Dobbs was a big loser in the 2006 congressional elections, no matter how mendaciously he tries to spin it as a "victory" now. "Populism" and nativism are not a mix recognized by progressives; if he thinks so, then Dobbs is an even more irrational demagogue than any of us may already suspect. 
 I have watched this show at least 15 times so I know the tunes by heart. The songs listed on this page are NOT the songs from the movie Desp. seeking susan.  Can someone get these changed????  I did go to freeMP3.com and heard the same tittled tracks and THOSE ONES are the real deal. I LOVE the tunes from this movie! 
 update... these slippers finally arrived last week.  It only took about 3 months for them to arrive!  That said, they appear to be of very good quality.  I ordered a pair of these on November 13.  As of January 16, they still haven't shipped.  Would be nice to know if they *ever* will be shipped 
 Stephanie Coontz, "scholar" at prestigious Evergreen State College, has delivered yet one more broadside against reason and intellectual honesty. One need not spend time dismantling the arguments of those who find her work fair and balanced - propagandists have always had their supporters. Suffice it to say that this is characteristic of what passes for "scholarship" at today's college, which is to say, it is simply awful. Coontz relies entirely on whatever meager evidence she can muster supporting her premise, while totally ignoring any and all evidence to the contrary. In this case, that contrary evidence is massively overwhelming - but no matter - the end justifies the means. Tripe 
 Brazilian music by non-Brazilians usually lacks a certain charm and unfortunately, this CD is anything but an exception.  The good thing about this CD was that it tributed Jobim and had excellent musicians and songs  like Oleta Adams, Al Jarreau and El Debarge.  The problems were the remakes  of the songs.  For example "Waters of March" is very  disappointing and even more so annoying-- not Oleta Adams singing style at  all.  For the time being, stick to the original Jobim/Gilberto/Regina Bossa  Nova albums OR try another compilation 
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 I wrote a very long review for this book weeks ago that somehow didn't get posted. Maybe amazon didn't accept it, or maybe I simply forgot to "save" after the preview page. Either way, this one will be condesnsed.  This book summed up: Interesting gimmick, bad execution.   Despite the scandelous subject, book reads like a bad blockbuster movie script. Micheal Bay could direct this. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the romance is cheesey and unbelievable, the dialogue is atrocious and the whole thing is way less interesting than the subject makes you hope it will be.   Beyond its problems in character, plot and romance, this book suffers from James Morrow's horrible tin ear. To put it simply: the prose is bad. His metaphors are strained and annoying... in fact, one gets the feeling he is desperately trying to prove his book is "literature" by overwhelming us with flowerly metaphors and references to Shakespeare and the Greeks.   In his references, Morrow fails as well. Take this one, which I will paraphrase: "Like Sysiphus, He and his friends rolled their giant tin drums all the way back to camp, which they reached by sundown."   The entire essensce of the Sisyphus myth is that he has an impossible task bestowed as punishement. Yet the character in this book completes his task IN THE SAME SENTENCE! Hardly Sisyphian. But, hey, he threw out a greek name, so I guess that makes him smart, eh?   This book is by no means horrible. But with all the amazing literatue out there, why settle for something so mediocre? Even in the realm of religious themed sci-fi/fantasy there are many better books. Don't waste your time.   p.s. As an interesting note, when I was a college freshman and pretending to be a poet, one of the first poems I wrote was a narrative about God's dead body falling to earth. If I coudl think it up, I'm sure many people have done the same, so ultimately I can't even give Morrow much credit for the central gimmick. 
 From the title. one would expect an in-depth review of the New York City PD, its officers and its problems.  What one gets is a ranting history of the NYC police from day one. Most of the book zeros in on a few unknown police officers who the authors tell us were the heros of their day.(Their day being 1850-1940)  The last few chapters bring us to "modern day NYC" and again-with the exceptional addressing of modern police problems (during the mid to late 1960's the NYPD experienced over 100 police officers killed in the line of duty-this book makes quick light of that)we are again rewarded with the tales of 2 more "unknown NYPD heros" that the authors force feed us.  In essence, this is a poorly written, totally uninteresting book devoid of any clinical insight into the modern day NYP 
 I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles 
  If you like Murder-Mysteries; you might like this. Attractive leads perform an average script.   Technically, good costumes, good lighting, attractive sets. The story holds your attention. The detective is interesting, and his sleuthing has some interest. If you like a light Whodunnit; you may like this. As good as anything on TV today. I rated this 2-stars, compared to "Road to Avonlea, Third season" mystery episode with Christopher Reeve, which I rate 4-stars. Not as clever as the TV show "Columbo"; but the period setting may make up for this.   This did not have what I was looking for, some adventure, more believability, more charm, and more cleverness.   The sets are attractively "staged"; rather than sets that take you there. Has pleasant characters; but not deep. Some good humor personality with the servants. The appeal is for one who likes a light, Whodunnit detective film, in a period setting; without my great expectations. I remember "Young Sherlock Holmes" as better; though I saw it a long time ago. 
 Although my 32-month old loves to watch this movie, it has done nothing to further his interest in the potty. I think it spends too much time focusing on how great diapers are and the quality time Glen gets during diaper changes. It would have been nice too, if maybe Glen tried to go potty a time or two with no success, to show that it's okay not to get it on your first try. I know we have tons of tries before we have success. I agree with other reviewers that don't like that it doesn't address wiping or washing hands. We have ordered Potty Power and it should be here anyday.. 
 Templar history, the real history not the fervid imaginings regarding the Holy Grail and such, is a truly fascinating tale worthy of sustained study. But as the previous reviewer has observed, however, all of the tales in this collection are instantly forgetable as they are trite in conception and poorly written. They have the collective depth of creative writing exercises in a first year class. I threw my copy away 
 I purchased both this book and John Kremer's 1001 Ways to Market Your Book.  Kremer's book is far superior, far more thorough, and far more practical for self-publish authors.  Buy Kremer's book and save your time and money.  I don't recommend Guerrilla Marketing for Writers 
 I live in haiti and I do not see it how the person here says it. My children were able to attend literacy programs set up under aristide government.  With the UN and Latortue the programs were no more.  The only people killed in my town happened under Latortue and Cedras.  
 I wish I could give this Zero stars.  It is a very dark book and I can't imagine why anyone would write, publish, gift it, or read it.  There is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk?  Garbage in garbage out!  
 The premise of this book is: what would have happened to the history of the world if the Roman Empire had never fallen? Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt: rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do. However, because of that most people wouldn't try it.  The book would have been better as a collection of short stories. Each chapter is a story in itself, and then history normally jumps 300 years and all the characters who were in the last chapter are, clearly, dead. Another annoying thing about this method is that each chapter he has one of the characters recap the entire history of the Roman Empire, including all the chapters that you just finished reading.  Silverberg is also pretty inconsistent in certain things. First, he tries to Romanize all the place names in the beginning to the point that sometimes you don't know where he's talking about. But then on the next page he mentions the German boarder. Not only that, but when they discover the New World (a.k.a., Nova Roma) they come across Mexico and Peru. Also, later in the book he talks about how "Londin and Parisi" were major cities. I'm not that up on Roman history, but were those really the names of those cities during the Roman Empire?  There's also a bunch of historical inconsistencies. He wants to rewrite history as if the Roman Empire never fell, but yet there is still a "medieval" period (complete with knighthood) and a Renaissance. The Renaissance doesn't make sense because if there was no real "Dark Ages," how can they have a Renaissance? However, if I recall correctly, the whole concept of knighthood was part of the feudal system that arose as a form of organization once the Roman Empire fell. WWI and WWII also happen around the same times, but under the names of the First and Second Wars of Reunificantion. However, he's also somewhat inconsistent about what these wars refer to, having the Second War of Reunification refer first to subduing fights in the outer provinces and in the next chapter having it refer to the founding of the Second Republic. He's also inconsistent in the numbering of Emperors. For example, all of a sudden he has Trajan VII who is from Hispania and yet somehow even though it's special enough to mention that he's from Hispania, his name is still the same as six other Emperors before him, also you cannot seem to figure out when these people ever ruled. Not to mention my annoyance at the fact that the languages in Europe develop in exactly the same way that they did, which I'm not entirely sure would have happened if the Roman Empire hadn't fallen.  A big part of my annoyance comes from his treatment of the Hebrews. First of all, Silverberg is clearly of the belief that the Roman Empire fell because of the Christians. So how can he make Christianity not start in the first place? Well, clearly by having the Exodus fail and the Hebrews remain slaves in Egypt. Of course something that I realized toward the end of the book is that he refers to the Hebrews having followed the Law. If they never left Egypt, how did they get this Law? Not only that but I found it offensice that he portrays the Hebrews as being greedy and miserly with their money. He says that the Hebrews have a "knack for finance" (87) and one of the Hebrew characters in the first chapter is the only one "who kept the strings of his purse drawn tight" (28) while others are giving money to street entertainers. That stereotype arose in the Middle Ages because the Church restricted Jews to being moneylenders. However, (a) that's after the point in the story that the book starts at and (b) the stereotype would not have have been created if the the Roman Empire hadn't fallen. Yet Silverberg treats that stereotype as truth, and I find that offensive 
 I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate 
 After this latest half-assed attempt by Ryan Adams, at times brilliant and other times atrociously bad, he may very well be named the Joyce Carol Oates of country alternative.  Mr. Adams, let's face it, is a polluter, an extremely talented artist who is miring his most masterful accomplishments in tracks that are but creative waste.  There is something to be said for an artist who knows when to discriminate and keeps his throw-away tracks locked in a trunk somewhere to be released on a b-side box set once he's dead and gone.  Not so with Mr. Adams, who seems to be lacking this discriminatory mechanism in his brain.  Like the gratuitously unpleasant "Blossom" from his last 2-disc release (which was, what, a few weeks ago?), this 14-track CD is peppered with songs that go beyond mediocre into a realm closer to laziness.  All the songwriting talent that was required for "Don't Fail Me Now" was coming up with the clich title and knowing how to copy and paste it 20 times; and "September" is almost a flip of the bird to anyone who's ever spent months trying to write the perfect sad song.  When albums like this come out, I'm thankful for online programs like iTunes that allow you to download songs individually.  Because, frankly, I think both Mr. Adams and his fans would be better served if gems like "A Kiss Before I Go" weren't followed by the uninspired filler that is "Hard Way to Fall" and the like .. 
 I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price 
 If you want your point of view to prevail, it helps to be the last survivors, and Diana and Deborah Mitford managed that much.  Yes, folks, this is yet another apologia for those jolly fascist sympathetizers, Diana and Unity Mitford.  Deborah is, luckily for her, uninterested in politics, but she has supported Diana's poses (who-me-anti-Semitic?), which is unfortunate for this book.  The poor dumbstruck bourgeois author is thoroughly star-stuck by the glamourous Duchess and my Lady Moseley, and so we get no insight, no judgment, and good deal of discreet mud-slinging at the Mitford sister who was indiscreet enough to marry a Jew.  Because, you know she embarrassed her family by doing that---Unity's writing to a crappy German newspaper and declaring herself publicly as a 'Jew-hater' pales in comparison.    Since Diana has since kicked the bucket, aged 90 (support for the notion that the good die young), only the pernicious Duchess is left to bear of the standard of family before all.  I suspect the real story of the Mitfords won't emerge until she is no longer alive to prevent it 
    The fact is that Hollywood has become little more then a Gossip new town with magazines like variety and web-sites like Ain't It Cool and DARk Horizons putting out tons and tons of both electronic and newsprint propoganda that is as fake as anything we saw the superpowers do during the  Cold War.    This book seems to celebrate it, but it's eally sad, All three movies listed on the 2003 summer weekend were large on visual effects or glamor, but weak scripts and even weaker casting of people who can not act.   How anyone can see this as a good thing is beyound all rational thought to me, or good taste 
 0 stars if there were such a thing ugly boring squares (oops, i mean "patterns") cheesy hickish dialect Great! for middle america an example of bloggers jumping on the knitting book bandwagon feeding the sheep along the way really can't for the life of me figure out the hype behind this book 
 Let me first off admit that I haven't read this entire book, just some carefully chosen excerpts. But what I have seen is certainly cause for concern, regardless of the rest of the book's content. Oriana Fallaci's ideas, however genuinely felt, condemn an entire culture. She does not recognize good in any Muslims. She dismisses every piece of art and literature created outside the west. She propagates that idea that about 1.2 billion brown people across the globe are bent on destroying those who love freedom and peace. People applaud Fallaci for giving voice to their prime fear: that a significantly large group wants to, and has the means to, rip apart their way of life. What really frightens me is the arrogance that allows such generalizations to spread.   Of course America cannot be blamed for any attack on its soil. Our nation never, ever errs. Bin Laden did not release a document in 1998 explaining his objections to the destructive presence of U.S. troops in the Middle East, the unfair economic imbalance in the world, and our policy bias against the Palestinians.   I am not saying that blowing up 3,000 people is a justifiable solution. But the notion that any attack against our country is a result of our innate superiority- that is one I cannot accept. And I cannot accept praise for blatant prejudice against an ethnic group, simply because this woman is being "honest." A better description of her writing might be "defensive": "I do not need to defend their culture. I'm defending mine." "I am fraudulently called a racist, when this is not about race, it is about religion." I wonder how many times she read the Koran. I wonder if she knew that the Koran speaks against murder. I wonder if she acknowledged that the Bible has been used for centuries to justify murder and rape on a massive scale. She writes of Muslims from long ago enslaving her ancestors. I wonder if she understands how many people worldwide were enslaved by Italians, and that everyone at some point wronged another nation.   Whenever I sit and ponder these questions, my mind always returns to one thing: pure fear. Her own, and mine, incited by the many positive reactions to this book. It is terrifying to discover that hundreds of thousands of people could delude themselves into a self-importance complex that threatens innocent lives. So Oriana Fallaci is the new voice of the west, stripped of all its politically correct restraints? Count me out of this hemisphere. I hope that her angry, angry soul finds a little peace in the afterlife, and that something is done to lessen the fury in the hearts of her ignorant followers.  
 Steven Pinker lost me as a buyer of his thesis with the very second sentence of his book:   "For you and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability: we can shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision".  It you take that for granted, Pinker's book will seem compelling and not especially controversial. Steven Pinker clearly takes it for granted, perhaps because he can't conceive of how we could possibly communicate effectively and coherently if it were not true.   Consider the following, which I think perfectly encapsulates the world view Pinker can't conceive of, by Ogden Nash:  Caught in a mesh of living veins, In cell of padded bone, He loneliest is when he pretends That he is not alone.  We'd free the incarcerate race of man That such a doom endures Could only you unlock my skull, Or I creep into yours.  To my way of thinking, it is the very fact that we *can't* "shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision" - or with any reliable certainty at all, that describes the human condition. The frisson created by precisely that ambiguity underpins all communication; it is the source of irony, tragedy, comedy, invention and imagination. Any theory of language which denies that fundamental contingency of human communication (as this one does) is going to have to prove it, and displacing that onus is a heavy task indeed.  Pinker's psycho-linguistics makes precisely that denial, by holding that all human communication - every language - shares an inate, evolutionary programmed Universal Grammar, precisely because Pinker can't conceive how else human communication could be possible.  I'm no academic, and certainly I have no background in linguistics. Given that this theory - which is from the same tradition as Noam Chomsky's - has been the ascendancy amongst academic linguistics for the best part of the last thirty years, Steven Pinker being one of the leading "normal scientists" within the paradigm (if I should be so bold as to use that word), and that The Language Instinct is considered fairly widely to be his magnum opus, I was expecting to have my naive relativistic assumptions carefully and systematically dissected, then annihilated, one by one.  So imagine my surprise to find that in the place of carefully drawn arguments and compelling statistical data, one finds a tissue of anecdotal arguments carefully selected to fit the theory, arguments from authority ("Chomsky is one of the ten most cited writers in all of the humanities"), dubious suppositions in place of statistical data (the "it is difficult to imagine the following grammatical construction being used" sort of thing),  begged questions, non sequiturs, and Roger Penrose-style irrelevant scientific waffle - especially as regards evolution - and a decided absence of any consideration of competing theories of linguistics - and straw men versions of those which do rate a mentioned.   In short, Steven Pinker employs just about every illegitimate arguing technique in the book. His theory completely fails to account for metaphor (metaphor is barely mentioned in the book), nor the incremental development of language, the evolution of different languages with different grammars and vocabularies. At times Pinker is forced to argue that the grammar of our language is sometimes different from the words we actually speak and write, containing unspoken "inaudible symbols" representing a word or phrase which has been moved elsewhere in the sentence, so the sentence "The car was put in the garage", according to Pinker's Universal Grammar should technically be rendered as: "was put the car in the garage", and the construction we use can only be explained by movement of "The car" and the insertion in its place of an inaudible "trace":  "[The car] was put [trace] in the garage".  Now, again I am no technical linguist, but this has all the hallmarks of pure bull manure to me.  Finally, Pinker is at pains to point out that Universal Grammar is only ever applicable to oral language: written language didn't arise for centuries after oral grammar "evolved" as a phenotype.  But this hardly helps Pinker, since (as he himself points out, with reference to a transcript of the Watergate Tapes) when people talk in ordinary conversation they almost *never* use complete grammatical sentences: they interrupt themselves, they rely on physical gestures, they break off in mid stream and start a new thought, they don't punctuate (there's no unequivocal punctuation in spoken English), all the time.   As is fashionable amongst the "reductivist" and "evolutionary" set these days (a set I would otherwise, in general terms, consider myself in agreement with), relativist arguments are scorned. But Pinker's paradigm implies that, provided we are competent in constructing our own sentences, we should all understand each other perfectly, all the time: there should be no ambiguity; no room for miscontrual; no possibility for evolution in ideas or language. It is difficult to see how anyone could believe such a thing. But neither the structure of language and grammar nor its practical use needs to be perfect for effective communication *at some level* to be possible, and surely that is all that is needed. The beauty of the contingent view of language, which Pinker seems unable to appreciate, is how it can account for the missed margin of communication which might explain the everyday cultural and interpretative problems we all face, and the figurative and metaphorical power we all find at our disposal. Ogden Nash's dilemma is our dilemma, however much Steven Pinker might wish it were otherwise.  An earlier reviewer has mentioned Geoffrey Sampson's "the Language Instinct Debate" as a compelling antidote to Pinker's world view. Having recently read it (on the strength of that recommendation), I would firmly agree. In perhaps an ill-advisedly grumpy tone, Sampson - whose position at the University of Sussex inevitably means his academic profile is lower than Pinker's or Chomsky's - systematically and convincingly annihilates many of the arguments (such as they are) in Pinker's work.

 In terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - "Rent" has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.  The story, a modern day update of "La Boheme" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them "deadbeats") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.  "Rent" - with its noble "performance artists" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical "Angel") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded "job" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.   With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.   In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.    As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of "the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.    There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.   I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for "Rent" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially "sensitive" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else 
 I found this book to be more or less devoid of useful or interesting material, with two exceptions. I liked some of the feats presented in the book and I liked the section on creating immortals. The rest of the book was fluff, useless, a waste of space. The book tries to explain goodness to players, all of which know what it means to be good anyway. It presents a whole mess of groupings of deities which anyone could make up on their own, which is basically the way Wizards of the coast present everything divine. Instead of giving 7000 examples of divine beings, why not give us a book about how to build them, details of how divine beings interact, create, and how they fit into the cosmos? Anyone DM truly worth his salt makes all his own stuff up anyway rather than using the junk in books like this and the Manual of the Planes. Spend money on something else like Heroes of Battle, a much better book and more useable 
 Not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower.  This is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty.  Not usable as a shower.  Good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower 
 This book is a prime example of the old adage: "Those who can't do, teach." The author of this book has never been the primary author of a major scientific paper (he is a professor of English), but he tries to give advice on how to write an effective scientific article. Because he has little to say on the subject, much of the text is made up of amusing anecdotes and quips rather than substantive guidelines. An example of the unhelpful advice he doles out is on page ninety-two, where he advises the reader to submit a typed, rather than handwritten, manuscript to the publisher. He litters his chapters with cute Peanuts cartoons depicting Snoopy getting rejection letters from publishers: a great way to take up space, but not useful to someone seeking practical advice on how to prepare a scientific article. He also gives advice on good grammar, which is more within his area of expertise. But there are better books on the subject of good writing, the classic example of which is Strunk and White's Elements of Style. I would advise the fledgling scientific writer to read many scientific articles in order to learn how to construct them effectively. On the other hand, if you want to learn how to write a whole book about something of which you know almost nothing, Dr. Day's "How to Write & Publish a Scientific Paper" would be a great place to start 
 I tried to read this book.  I really tried.  I got it on sale because I'd heard of the author and was curious.  This is the first book in my memory that I have put aside because I hated every sentence in it.  Normally I struggle through the first part of a "boring" book and become pleasantly surprised by the end.  I just couldn't get past the first fifty pages, and not without lack of effort.  The sad part is that I wanted to like this book and made an honest effort to, but the author made that impossible for me.  My advice is don't read this one - there are better books out there.  Who knows, in a few years I may even be willing to try one of Eco's earlier works.  Then again, I hate this book so much that I doubt I'll even be willing to concede to that.  If you like "historical" fiction, try Carter Beats the Devil or the Venus Throw, which are a lot more fun to read 
 This book was published in 2001. Five years have passed and there is no sign that China is about to collapse anytime soon. The author was blinded by an inability to see substantial progresses behind the gloomy numbers he one-sidedly presented.  Take human right for example, do you know that there are now hundreds of thousands of advocates fighting for the right of ordinary people in China? If these advocates exist in the past, they would have just been thrown into "reformation camp" for years. Yes, nowadays these people are still harassed, but the harassments have become more "civil". What a consolation, you may say! Well, laugh at it if you wish. What I am trying to say is that we should not use an all-or-nothing kind of attitude when we look at China. As a matter of fact, many advocates would tell you that although they are harrased, the government is listening to what they have to say, and it does make essential adjustments based on these voices. Let's face it, the Hu's and the Wen's of China are probably much smarter than Mr Chang, and I venture that they probably care much more about the well being of China than Mr. Chang or you or I.  The pragmatism of the current CCP government testifies to that.   Another example is that Mr. Chang's takes (a very brief one in the last chapter) on Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiag are flatly wrong. He seems to have thought that Chen Shui Bian was a hero. But alas! Time has proved that Chen is a clown.  For your information, his supporting rate has just dropped to an all time low (18%, George Bush must be happy that someone over yonder is doing much worse than he does) a few weeks ago and the pro-independence force is shrinking as the pragmatism of the now energized KMT wins over more and more rational people. As I write this review, the KMT and the CCP are holding a forum in Beijing and I have just read the excellent speeh of Lien Chan, calling for more interactions and cooperations between the two sides. Mr. Chang could not have dreamed of this in 2001. As the CCP likes to say, "the tide of history cannot be resisted." :-)  And finally, let's not buy too much into what the Falun Gong people have to say about CCP and China. Their agenda is clear: CCP is pure evil, bring it down at all cost. Well, these people are being consciously marginalized more and more by the mainstream Chinese societies in and out of China, because people do not perceive what they are doing to be beneficial to China. China (the people and the government) needs to be constructively engaged, not demonized.  Keep your eyes open, read more from Asian news medias, for they can provide a much needed counterbalance to the demonizing tendency coming from the West. It will be better if you can read Chinese, then you will get a really good balance based on which you can judge the true state of the affair yourself. If you only read the Gordon Chang's of the world, I feel sorry for you.  And by the way, forget about this book. If you really want to read it, do so with a critical attitude 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 The only reason to go for this book is if you are a real collector of sex instruction books and need to have this to complete your "classics" section. This book was written a long time ago and is rather "out of date" and certainly not informed about alot of the really powerful devellopments in human sexuality which have occurred in the 90's and beyond. I mean, even lame sex-instruction authors like Nora Hayden and Lou Paget do better than this re-issue. If you really want to get something worthwhile in this category you should look at "9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power" by Clint Arthur. That book is very modern and covers all the bases. Or go for something on video like Dr. Corynna Clarke's "Goddess Worship," which is a truly fresh and beautiful look at "modern sensual healing. 
 The first "Cruel Intentions" was highly underrated. There was a strong chemistry within the cast (obviously since Reese & Ryan married!) and the characters weren't one dimensional. Even evil Kathryn was capable of pain that Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to convey in brief moments which was perfect for that character. But Cassidy for CI3 falls way short of being three dimensional. She's just cruel for the whole film and showed no weakness. Everyone has a weakness. However, I will say that the character Patrick somewhat intrigued me. He went beyond the game of cruelty and ...well, I won't give away what happens, but I was very disturbed by it. As for Kerr, he was alright. Its not his fault his character was kind of dull. Anyway, the film is "ok". Its worth watching if you run into it on cable, but I wouldn't buy the movie. 
 Has some factual and historical information, but now dated.  Borrow it from the library........ 
 In his recently published history, The Whiskey Rebellion, William Hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania. What Hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of Howard Zinn. He has an axe to grind, and by the end Alexander Hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the American Revolution to its necessary conclusion.  The accusation that Hogeland comes back to again and again is that Hamilton incited the rebellion. The argument is that because Hamilton's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen's resistance, and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion.  The problem with Hogeland's argument is his scholarship, or lack there of. He almost never offers a direct quote, especially when accusing Hamilton of malfeasance. Instead, Hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote. The reader is expected to accept on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end. Not all of this is Hogeland's fault. The new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting, opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop. Even Doris Kearns Goodwin, a legitimate scholar, is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze.  Ultimately, this is the main problem with William Hogeland: he is not a scholar. He is a magazine writer with an agenda, and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions. To read some radical agenda into the actions of the Pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history, because there is no basis in reality. 
 I recently found this first book of Durant's impressive-looking multivolume history set at my local library and was instantly enraptured at the thought of a comprehensive tour down through the ages of our known history. Unfortunately my expectations were soon dashed as I began to read. Instead of history, I found one man's opinions and a lot of rank speculation. While admittedly much of history is guesswork because, well, we weren't there, this author stretches that license beyond what is reasonable.  "History" as that term is normally defined means a narrative of what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and to whom it happened. In several hundred pages I learned very little to answer these fundamental questions. What I found instead were rather strained conclusions and sometimes quite enormous logical leaps about cultural characteristics and mores of ancient peoples, often based on the scantiest of evidence. For example, the discovery of cereal grains in a non-native environment is interpreted to mean that a people "must" have already developed agriculture. What about the possibility of trade? What about the possibility that, at that time, the cereals in question were, in fact, native to that area? Large numbers of these types of sweeping conclusions, in my opinion, left me with little confidence in the credibility of what I was reading. Another example is the author's unabashedly Darwinistic bent that leads him to place far too much weight on the reliability of the "Peking Man" and similar fossil evidence. Even he uses words like "may" and "possibly" in describing whether these are, in fact, human remains. However, the extreme sketchiness of this and other evidence doesn't deter him from making rather dogmatic statements about presumed developments during the paleolithic period.  Similar to that were the author's repeated interjections of his own opinions about the development of culture, morality, social norms, etc. Again, as a student of history I want to know what happened, not the author's opinion about what happened. Yet when I read statements about how clothing developed as the result of a regressive cultural movement away from the "paradise of primitive nudity," quite frankly I just want to yak up my lunch. The author also seems to seize frequent opportunities to take jabs at the opinions and conclusions of other researchers. It was almost as if I were sitting in on one side of a petty squabble between a couple of petulant children.  In short, the flavor I got of Will Durant's master work in the first several hundred pages left me deeply disappointed. I was very much looking forward to reading the whole set, but now I cannot see the point of wasting any more time on even the first volume. Just because it's big and old, that doesn't mean it's great 
 Mr Biskind's previous book, "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls" was far better, simply because the people he wrote about (directors like Friedkin, Scorsese, Altman, etc.) were more interesting people and filmmakers. I never had the feeling that the author really cared about the movies he was writing about. This book is really about Miramax and Harvey Weinstein and once you've understood that Harvey Weinstein is a savvy producer but also a monster prone to uncontrollable fits of rage, you've understood 70% of the book's content. There are some interesting passages, mainly about Tarantino and Soderbergh, but the same story could have been told in a much shorter form. I often had the impression that the publisher badly wanted a 400 pages book, even if 250 pages would have been more than enough 
 After the wonderful Storming Heaven I was so excited to read this book, and then so disappointed.  The plot is melodramatic, the characterizations cardboard 
 Shredder may have been not quite a low budget movie. It had a high budget for a straight-to-video film. However, it was low on originality and scares. The movie's originality was so basic. When the ending came up I thought to myself "Of course I should of known." The ending was completely un-original. Also the movie wasn't quite scary. Although I did like one murder. But Bottom-Line is that it wasn't one of the worst straight-to-video horror movies I ever saw, but it wasn't one of the best either 
 I can't beleive the amount of good reviews of this CD.  I have most of the Pat Metheny library and this CD is the worst by far.  It was like listening to all of his un-inspired, not-as-good, filler songs in one sitting.  Yuck!  Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Metheny's work, but this CD was just BAD 
 I did like the Three Cheers album, in fact I liked every single song on the cd.  The Black Parade is basically the same thing.  In every song I find myself being reminded of a song on the previous cd.  This cd is extremely similar but has less diversity.  If you already own Three Cheers, I wouldn't waste the money on Black Parade 
 I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad.  I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie.  The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular.  It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art.  That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real. 
 I can only assume the applauding professional and amateur reviewers were swept away by Lacey's evocative descriptions of Lansky's surroundings and cultural background.  Lacey's detailed study is, I will readily admit, finely wrought, but this book should have been sold as fiction.  Besides totally whitewashing Lansky, "Little Man" is peppered with countless factual errors (e.g. Joe the Boss Masseria was not waiting for a late lunch when he got hit in 1931--  he'd already eaten a huge lunch), many of which bolster the author's fantastic characterization of his subject.   Where is there any discussion of Lansky's operation in Covington, Kentucky?  Why is Murder, Inc. mentioned only three times in this book when Lansky was crucial to Siegel and Lepke's killing-for-hire enterprise?  I certainly understand a biographer's decision to lionize his/her subject, but this exoneration of a well-documented monster is criminal 
 I bought this book a few weeks ago and very unhappy with it when it came.  I was able to flip through the book and read all the information in about 15 minutes total.  There was nothing new in that book that I didnt already know.  And certainly nothing more than I could find for free on [...].  I can see that it may be helpful for someone who knows nothing about wedding planning, but not useful for the average woman.  Instead, save your money and buy a binder with some dividers and head to [...] 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I don't find a closeness to God in the pages. Instead it seems intellectual. It contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with God face to face. Even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal God I seek. And though the author's prayers are included too, I feel the same about them. I expected more from Richard J. Foster 
 The author makes a lot of clear statements about what is acidifying and what is alkalizing.  However, some of what he says is the exact opposite of other sources of information I've found.  Unlike the other sources, Vasey never ever (as far as I could tell) explained how he knew what he said was true.  He never mentioned doing any testing on the foods (as far as I could tell).  He never mentioned any sources of his information.  We are just suppose to assume he is a font of all wisdom on this subject for no reason that I could understand.  I believe it was Bertrand Russell who said that insight untested is no guarantee of the truth.  As he never explained his source of knowledge on this, I don't trust him 
 The training plans in this book for "fit" (there are two sets of plans for each distance: "fit" vs. "unfit") are way too conservative.  I found myself using the Olympic distance plan to train for a Sprint distance triathlon.  There is no way following the "fit" Olympic distance plan I could have completed that distance.  It's suitable for training for a Sprint however but that's not what is intended by the author.  I also find it annoying that so much of the book is dedicated to these different flavors for both individuals and for teams.  It began to feel like me that the author was padding the book to make it longer.    Since most folks (like me) would buy a beginner book for the training plans I cannot recommend this book to a beginner to formulate a plan unless you feel like under-training and slogging through your first event. 
 I give this book 2 stars for the occasional first person insights into the Doors. But there is too little of it. There is too much of the rantings of a man who is apparently trapped in the 6os, and is undergoing a personal mind battle between himself as a flower child and a business man. He often comes on as one or the other of these two conflicting images.  Often he rants about the establishment and their love of power and money, but at the same time he exudes great excitement when he describes the business and money aspect of his music career; like the big bucks he got when 'Light my Fire' hit the charts and the new car and beach house he was able to then buy. Or when he describes getting his first royalty check from Elektra and "Grinning and Dithering" while he makes his wife guess at the figure. Then she "squeals" and they hug and yell "We're rich!" A few pages later he goes on ranting about power and money hungry people.  I found too much hypocrisy in his writing like when he keeps using the phrase "I hope the lovers win the war. Don't you?" Then a few pages later he comes on as anything but a lover with his nasty second-hand gossip about Morrison allegedly telling him that he didn't like John Desmore. Uh, wouldn't a true lover and person who preaches peace and goodwill amongst each other, have kept that to himself rather than basically telling the world "Jim liked me more than John." I mean, what does that serve other than hurting another man's feelings? Nasty stuff from a self professed lover of people.  "Break On Through" is a much more supperior book on this topic. And it is a shame. Because with Manzarek's personal insight into the group, he could have provided the greatest story....But instead he chose to hog the spotlight and put too much of himself, his hypocritical pseudo hippy rantings, and his mean spirited jabs at others who were a part of this chapter in his life, into this book. I was hoping for more. Instead he delivered mostly junk 
 This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work.  I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out.  I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on.  Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books.  And he sounds like a real prima donna.  
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This refers to the double CD edition (not "Level 1"): Neither good dnb nor ambient. This compilation is likable after listenieng to it a few times but it lacks both originality and excitement in my opinion. Almost all tracks follow the same pattern, the drums are rather uniform making it sound like d'n'b has nothing more to offer. If you like smooth repetitive grooves than it may be your thing but if you want to listen to some good d'n'b check the likes of Roni Size or Talving Singh instead. There are a few pieces that have some interesting loops and rhythms and a good ambiental feeling to it (note though "So Long" on disc a seems to be influenced by #5, disc 1 on Selected Ambient Works vol.II by Aphex Twin) but these are few and far between to make up for the overall dull feeling of the compilation 
 More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations. 
 While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight.  There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.  
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 If you enjoy the idea of Lester Bangs, don't read his writing. It just proves he was never anything but another drugged-up beat scumbag. And not in an amusing way 
 If anybody knows anything about music, you don't judge an artist on how many albums they sell or there image, you judge them on raw talent and the total package. Please anyone correct me if I'm wrong. When Mariah came out in the early 90's she was unstopable. She had a slew of hit singles, she wrote her own music she was on the top of her game. Then in the late 90's she fell off because she left pop music ( which made her famous) and she wanted to get in touch with her inner Snoop Dog and go more R&B and have a lot of rap artists on her CD's Snoop dog, Bonethugs in harmoney, P diddy on Honey remix and the lists goes on with Rainbow, Glitter, and Charmbraclet which didn't sell compared to her previous albums because she changed her formula.  She went with more midtempo songs that didn't require a lot of vocal range and high notes because when you have an album with a lot of ballads you have to perform these songs live on talk shows like the Rosie O'Donnell show, Mtv, and Ellen and that puts a lot of strain on your vocal cords and as you get older you can't hit them high notes any more and you don't want to embarrass your self on national tv. So she did a lot of breathy numbers and made her videos more sexier so you can focus on her body and everthing hanging out and not focus on her voice. Not to mention she had to fit in the teenie bop audience because Britney was selling cd's off the hook.  I believe that she loves Rap and R&B but she seen that she wasn't selling like she used too so she decided with this album she had no choice but to go back to the ballads that made her famous in the first place. She had major success with this album because she is singing again. But she cannot sing live anymore. She sounds amazing on CD only and cannot hit those notes live. I respect that she is where she is because of her talents but as of now she is nowhere the best female vocalist anymore.   She is so overated now. Mine again, and Circles she can't sing live are you crazy she won't be able to speak for a month if attempted. The best female vocalist right now is Christina Aguilera. Her voice is so Powerful and clear she blows me away all the time. When she sings live she's like a beast and attacks the song. she sings like she is living the song right there. If you don't believe me get the Stripped DVD and get ready to be blown away. I don't care how she dresses she can blow any one away LIVE. Real talent isn't studio processed. It's live. Anybody who can surpass there studio recordings LIVE is the real deal. Mariah was the best now it's Christina 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 This book would have been better titled "Dips" as it has more recipes for dips to use after you make a fondue than the fondue itself.  It does discuss fondues, very briefly, but it didn't tell me anything I didn't  already know and it didn't answer the questions I needed answered.  If you  aren't already well acquainted with making fondues this book will be of  little help 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions.  On my couch the mouse is dead. If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive. But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky.  Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse.... I am returning this product.  Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen.  
 Picture me [a male] handing this book to a female employee - with encouragement to read...  of course you can't - and i can't as well  
 Let me first say, I have always loved Mary Higgins Clark.    Mostly because the plots are great and the reading is quick, generally comfortable, easy reading.  For some reason, I am having a horrible time getting through this book.  I have been reading it for a week now, off and on, and it still hasn't grabbed me.  I think I have figured out the ending and as I am 2/3's of the way through, I will go ahead and finish it.  If you are a true Mary Higgins Clark fan, you WILL be disappointed with this one.  Final note:  I couldn't finish the book.  It went to the recycle bin.  Ugh 
 R Kelly's third instalment of the Twelve Play albums is downright horrible.Listening to this album gave me the impression that he lacked inspiration while he was recording it.Most of the songs are crass and forgettable.The only highlight of the album are the melodramatic chapters of "Trapped in the Closet".Overall this is a below-average album 
 Meic Pearse is a traditionalist and a Christian.  He defines the "clash of civilizations" in terms that at their core relate to his belief in the moral and spiritual infallibility of the Bible.  Thus on pages 77-79 he defines human rights in terms of Biblical scripture, concluding that the sort of human right "that is claimed simply by virtue of one's existence" to be "not derived" from "Scripture" and therefore not something he is in agreement with.  We can see that Pearse IS in agreement with the Muslim belief that laws come from God and not from human beings themselves.  So it is not surprising to read this: "Normal people (that is, the rest of the world)...cannot exist without real meaning, without religion anchored in something deeper than existentialism and bland niceness, without a culture rooted deep in the soil of the place where they live." (p. 29)  Nicely expressed, but I wonder, do these "normal people" that exist outside the West--would that include humanists and agnostics, Buddhists and Hindus, Taoists and Zen Buddhists, Jains and Vedantists--indeed mainstream Christians, Jews and Muslims--or is he just referring to the subset of people who follow the fundamentalist expression of the Middle Eastern religions?  It is also not surprising that Pearse echoes the reaction of some fundamentalist clerics in the West. e.g., Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who declared after the World Trade center was hit by terrorists that essentially we had it coming.  This view is one that I find abhorrent because, while it does not exactly condone such murderous acts, it tries to shift the blame from the murderers themselves to aspects of the American culture that they--Pearse, Robertson, Falwell and others, along with the fundamentalist Muslims--find threatening to their world view.  In truth, Pearse's is a rearguard action against not just Hollywood and commercial America (the usual whipping boys), but against the basic tenets of democratic society.  We can see this in his statement that "human rights are essentially an invention of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment" whereas, "Traditional systems of morality worked on the principle of obligation: act this way; don't do that; you must; you shouldn't." (p. 64) Again he is in strong agreement with the traditionalist interpretations of the three Abrahamic religions.  My problem with those who worship "the Bronze Age God of battles," with those who find their authority in ancient texts and their behavioral guidance in tribalism, including intolerance of other points of view and the use of violence to resolve differences, is their utter irrelevance to, and ignorance of, the real issues the world faces today.  The fundamentalist interpreters of religion are Dark Age relics of a mentality that cannot possibly come to grips with the very real challenges of science, globalism and the postmodern world.  How a God that has a bad temper in whose image it is insisted that we were made, a God that apparently has a beard and an alimentary tract (what would he need that for?), a God that seems not to have any kind of grip on his world, but must resort to suicide bombings and tanks and guided missiles in order that His will be done--how can such a God of the tribe and superstition hope to cope with the 21st century?  Pearse seems to think that people who do not accept this God and his authority are atheists (he uses the term again and again to describe those in disagreement with his views) who hold values "not as an alternative to traditional values but as a negation of them--as anti-values, in fact." (p. 29)  This then is the problem.  It is not so much that Pearse is in disagreement with Western culture.  It is much worse than that.  What he perceives as Western culture he calls "an anticulture."  In other words, he and those who think like him have values and culture.  Those who disagree with his primitive view of religion, do not.  He sees only the culture of the mass media and the mass mind.  He doesn't seem to realize that people like David Hume and John Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, existed, and he clearly turns his back on the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights in which men are declared to have inalienable rights.  In other words, Pearse would be a Christian fundamentalist Muslim--if such a creature existed, finding authority not in science or the Declaration of the Rights of Man, or in the cultural traditions coming out of the Enlightenment, but instead following only the authority of Scripture--which of course means following the authority of Scripture as interpreted by the clerics currently in power, as it had always been until the rise of the modern world.  Finally I don't think "they" hate us so much as Pearse likes to imagine.  The anti-Americanism that we see expressed today is largely a result of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq and the unilateralism of his attitude.  After all, it could be said that they "hate" us in Europe too.  America still has an enormous amount of good will in the world, and we are looked upon by hundreds of millions of people as the best hope for humankind and admired for our democratic way of life and our system of government with its checks and balances and its respect for individual human rights--something that authoritarian people like Pearse do not fully appreciate 
 These are not only not the greatest closing arguments in modern law, there are barely competent.  Okay, maybe this is a slight overstatement--I liked Spence on Silkwood, but the rest are lackluster.  The title should be, "A few ponderous closing arguments given in high-profile cases.&quot 
 Girls in this movie are portrayed as underdogs struggling against stupid boy bullies. It's a pretty way to boy-bash and promote sexist stereotypes that girls are good and boys are bad. 
 Boy do I feel like chump. I bought this DVD based on the reviews here and because of it's overall 4 star rating. Holy Crap was I ever sucker punched in the back of the head by this wretched little pile-o-lizard spittle   I love cult films and I also love films that are so bad they are good etc. and I guess that's the main reason why I fell for these reviews hook, line & sTinker!   I could not even find it in my heart to finish this movie after about an hour I couldn't take it no more, so back in the case and into the garbage disposal crunch crunch Bye Bye. Aaaarrrggghh one can only wait so long for something/anything of interest to happen or be said.  Please don't end up a chump like me and stay away from this one, because I can assure you the people who wrote these great reviews are not going to get together, take a collection and give you you're money back. Bitter? You bet. 
 As a few others have noted, the battery on this is... questionable. I had a Remington a long time ago, and then a Panasonic, and I think I'll try one of those again. I bought this in Feb of '03 here with a Gold Box discount for $36 total, and it seems too soon for it to stop working 
 When I received this book as a gift, I was so happy and grateful. I have read many of Isabel Allende's books from House of Spirits, Daughter of Fortune, Tales of Eva Luna and others. I couldn't wait to start reading this one. I was so disappointed. Perhaps because Allende was trying to stay true to this historical character rather than letting her imagination take her where it wanted to go. This book is just plain boring. I'm sorry to say it about one of my favorite author's work. I wish her editors would have been honest with her and stated the truth. I read half way through the book hoping for it to get interesting. But it never did. I finally had to abandon it and picked up another book to read instead. Will it put me off reading Allende? Definitely not. She's done it so many times before, she can do it again. Besides, she's entitled to a dud or two. And who knows. Maybe it was just me. Others, evidenced by the other comments posted, loved this book. 
 This book pulls together a lot of information, but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly. I have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in CEA.  Long, boring, convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book. It took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like JAMA, NEJM, BMJ etc.  If you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it. Alternatively if you want to quickly determine what CEA is about, I would recommend reading Peter Muennig and Kamran Khan "Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care" 
 (Written for Worm's Sci Fi Haven by Dagny Taggart, more of her reviews can be read here: www.wormsscifi.com/haven)   Colin Laney is a special kind of private investigator. He is an investigator in the John Nash/Beautiful Mind sense: he can look at random bits of information that surround a person or event, and tell you what the information focuses on, what's going to happen, what you can do to change what will happen, to your advantage, of course.   Laney has been retained by the security team of Rez, the lead singer of Lo/Rez, the latest Japanese superband. Rez has fallen in love with Rei, who is an "Idoru", a 100% virtual media superstar. Makes me think of the movie Simone. Rez has announced to the world (and his fan club full of adoring teenagers) his plans to marry the Idoru. It is believed that Rez was coerced into this plan. Laney has been hired to prove it and expose the guilty party.   Meanwhile, Chia, an American teenager has also heard the marriage announcement, and she goes to Japan as an emmissary of the American Lo/Rez fan club. Chia visits with both American and Japanese fan club members via her computer, in the virtual world (can you say "Matrix"?). Chia feels she is getting deeper into some kind of conspiracy, and she knows it revolves around Rez, but she is only able to get tiny bits of information. Also, the virtual reality she visits is being inhabited by the Idoru.   William Gibson is certainly an ingenious product of the modern world. Typically, when I say "product of the modern world", I do not mean that as a compliment. But all the movies that this reminds me of, such as "The Matrix", "Simone", and "Wag the Dog", they all came out at least 3 years after this book was published in 1996. That means Gibson created the virtual world, The Matrix, first. Bravo to him.   Plot wise, I had a good time. Lots of suspense, some absolutely beautiful virtual environments, a bit of quick confusion at the end. However, after a while I started to wonder, except for the eccentricity bit, why would anyone care that a famous singer would want to marry a nicer, cuter, and female version of Agent Smith? Seriously? Yes, it's very eccentric and avant-garde, but what's the harm? What's the big deal? Why the big hissy fits?   Good job on cyber-punk. Fun romp. Reads like a screenplay. Not much depth. I didn't see how the Idoru was "more than he'd ever seen, enough to break a man's heart", or "the things that bother Rez aren't the things that bother most people', like the teaser in the just jacket promised. 
 I purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a USB charging cradle that would not work.  This is terrible, terrible quality control and I will never trust another casio product. 
 blue orchid is a great song but the rest of the album sux...the songs are kinda weird 
 The folksy advice and complicated concoctions in this book seem to be more fantasy than reality.  They call for more ingredients than you'd find in any grocery store, and in order to make these juicy refreshments, you have to have a wide variety of juices on hand. Not to mention a dozen appliances for blending, chopping, squeezing and processing the ingredients they way the book describes.   I was hoping for something that said "juice 2 apples, a stalk of celery and a bannana."  But this book says something like, "blend 1.5 oz. apple juice, 3/4 oz. of celery juice, and 3/4 oz of banana juice."  It doesn't suggest how much of each fruit you need on hand to make the desired amount.  It doesn't even focus on Juicing, which is why I bought it.    Looks cute on the bookshelf, and that's where it will stay.  UN-USED 
 A few weeks ago, I happened to pick up a couple books by Ted Dekker, mainly because the plot summaries made them look interesting.  The first of these books, Three (or more properly, Thr3e), was a disappointment, but Dekker did at least show some ability with his plotting, so I decided to give my other book of his a chance.  Sadly, while Obsessed is slightly better than Three, it is still a weak effort.  The hero in Obsessed is Stephen Friedman, a realtor in 1973 Los Angeles.  Friedman - a secular Jew - is living a fast and fun life which is about to be turned upside down when he finds out his mother, who he never knew, had died.  Among the items she bequeathed to a Holocaust Museum was a Stone of David, one of five rocks that legend says David used to slay Goliath.  With the other four, the set could be worth a hundred million dollars.  The history of the stones goes back to a Polish concentration camp run by Gerhard Braun in 1944.  Braun is not only a Nazi, he is also a serial killer, a trait his son Roth has picked up as well.  In 1973, Roth comes to Los Angeles in search of the Stones and crosses paths with Friedman, who has learned a lot about his mother's history and of a girl named Esther who he seems destined to know.  Like the movie Laura, Friedman falls in love with a picture, in this case, that of Esther's mother Ruth (who he assumes Esther resembles), which will soon obsess him.  This novel has a lot of problems, principally because Dekker is not a very good writer.  For one thing, he is sloppy:  at one point he discusses Friedman worrying about streetlights at 7:30 on a summer evening, a time which would still be quite light out.  More significantly, Friedman is mentioned as being 31 years old, yet the story makes it clear he was born in 1944, making him only 28 at the beginning of the novel.  Plot points are left completely unclear, such as the fate of Friedman's friend, Sylvia.  Beyond the sloppiness, Dekker has more fundamental writing problems.  Despite the bulk of the story taking place in 1973, the reader rarely gets the sense of the time; sure, there are references to eight-track players and there are a couple stereotypical hippies, but for the most part, this could take place in 2007 with almost no noticeable effect.  And Friedman himself is a really weak character:  he's not very bright and he usually is reacting to situations instead of acting on them (actually, that's just as well, because when he tries to take action, he usually proceeds rather cluelessly).  I suppose that this can be categorized as Christian fiction (that seems to be the genre Dekker is associated with).  This has less to do with thematic material (however, religion does have something of a role in this story) than with the fact that the violence is strictly PG-13 and the romance (and language) is G-rated.  I've always had a wariness about this genre, not because of the subject matter, but because I feel that Christian fiction publishers don't focus as much on quality (although I'm sure some gems slip through) because they cynically assume they have an audience that is not as discriminating as long as the story is labeled "Christian" (the science fiction/fantasy field suffers a lot from this as well).  Unfortunately, Obsessed has done nothing to make me think any better of the genre.  If you like suspense fiction, read Michael Connelly, Lee Child, Jon Land or David Morell or a few dozen others, but avoid Dekker. 
 This book has a lot of great examples of illustration, but the layout of the book is way too confusing. I found myself often lost where I should continue to read. The intro for interface has very little help for the beginner to start this program. This book might be good reference for advanced users, but not for beginners. Maybe the author wants to make a nice-looking book, but this book is over-designed, lack of functionality . I would recommend video tutorial from Lynda.com, it's ideal for beginners who never used Corel Painter and Wacom drawing tablets 
 I bought this book with great anticipation, however as I started the install it went to frustration. I know nothing of Linux when I started this, and it became a disapointment. The information in the book generaly does not line up with the Linux I installed from the CD that came with it. Also the comands that he talkes about wer not present when I tried them. allot of the setup comands you have to install manualy, I had to do allot of trial and error. His book is also badly organized I find, I found my self fliping to differant sections of the book for the same item. Some of the instructions for setup at the install are in the middle of the book. This may be a good book for when you know what you are doing, but I dont recomend it for the beginner 
 I rented this movie for 2 reasons. First, because it looked like it might be a good horror movie and Second, because Casper Van Dien stars in it! This movie fails to live up to horror movie status and Van Dien's performance wasn't all that great even though I wish he would have had a bigger role in this movie. Overall disappointing movie and boring plot 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 My 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and Santa was kind enough to bring it for her.  The quality is fine, but it just doesn't do much.  She played with it for the first day, and has touched it maybe twice since.  I've seen these on clearance everywhere I've gone lately, too.  If your child is into playing "mommy", this is cute, but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn't really equate to lasting play value with this one 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 Too much emotionalism, too little Bible is why I give this book only 2 stars.  The problem is that Pinnock and others have gone off the deep end in their loathing of Calvinism and have denied to God some of His basic attributes as given in the Bible.  I agree that God does change His mind, but this does not have to imply that He is not omniscient.  But as I said, this book presents a glut of emotionalism when it should be presenting a glut of Bible.  I wish Mr. Pinnock and others had done a better job of presenting a case against Calvinism, as it is not hard to do if you know your Bible 
 I thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget.  I was wrong.  Instead, it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, on all kinds of architectural extravagances.  Perhaps this book could have a subtitle:  How to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house.  If you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply, this is the wrong book 
 In trying to counteract the perils of feminism in modern society without appearing too biased, Gilder goes ludicrously overboard by offering the "savage barbarian" thesis as an olive branch. In short, the all-consuming strength of the more societal and nurturing female is, according to Gilder, what 'straightens out' the otherwise savage and single human male. He offers as 'proof' such data as higher unemployment, mental illness, alcoholism, etc. among unmarried males. However, Gilder's claims---however beautifully written they may be---are not entirely accurate and are largely projections of his own philosophical agenda.    For example, unmarried people might have more of a tendency toward societal and/or psychological problems simply because their lack of socialization makes them more pre-disposed to such problems, not because they aren't married. You know, the fellow who doesn?t like people, who tends to be a loner, or who has never matured in maintaining *any* social relationship is not likely to get married let alone hold a job. In fact, Gilder fails to point out the epidemic of depression, alcoholism and other issues that can strike anyone----whether unmarried and ?barbaric?, or married with good jobs and nice families. Equally significant is the marked successes enjoyed by unmarried groups of males---countless hundreds of thousands who work as single professionals and choose bachelorhood for indefnite periods---perhaps as a ?trial? period to find a suitable mate, not to hunt for sexual prizes as predators. [Other successfull groups are liberated gay males who historically are among the more educated and higher achievers in society. I suppose that Gilder would respond by saying that gay men are less likely to be in the ?savage?category list and thus, more prone to toward culturization without the influence of wives. However, gay men are often just as sexually aggressive and masculine as their straight counterparts so where?s the inevitable barbarianism?] And what about the 50% infidelity rate among married men---many of whom have wonderful families and loving wives? Could it be that barbarianism never leaves the male, or that he is simply hardwired to always take part in the ?hunt?---despite the so-called powerful neutralizing influence of woman? Whatever the answers, Gilder?s grand over idealized scheme doesn?t seem to fit.    Another problem is Gilder?s notion that the primary subconscious motivation of intercourse is to bear children, not simply ?screw? around. But if true, then why do post-menopausal women enjoy sexual relations when they---and their body---know that children are not in the cards? Why do people often avoid, at all costs, the bearing of offspring via birth control and sometimes even abortion?     Gilder?s book is not without merit, as the idea of the nurturing female sensibilities counterbalancing the sometimes cruder and more aggressive male nature is probably somewhat accurate. And it?s also true that the push for women to act more like men has indeed made society a more crass and cruder place---but not necessarily because men are crass, but perhaps because women are acting less like women and losing the moral impetus of males to play more chivalrous and respectable mating roles? In conclusion, to simply assign all-consuming power to womanhood as the sole balancing act in society and to render, by default, males as pretty much hopeless brutes unable to change sans the influence of their counterparts *is* cynical, ridiculously sexist, and without any scientific basis whatsoever. [Imagine the reverse being written---that women would basically self-destruct without the presence of men?? A national outcry on Capital Hill would occur.] Perhaps Mr. Gilder might try a different tack that avoids trashing men, and sucking up to women as the master saviors of the human race 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 I have not recieved this product yet, therefore I cannot review it yet 
 I was very unimpressed when I opened this book. Im a lead guitarist and I've played for 8 years. This has no solo arrangements and not all the riffs are tabbed. I enjoyed the interview and thats about it. I probably learned about 3-5 song but I couldnt learn the whole song cuz none of the songs are tabbed all the way through. This is not worth your money 
 This book contains almost no photographs of finished projects.  There are hardly any diagrams of the intermediate steps, and the instructions are minimalistic at best.  This book assumes a reasonable knowledge of cabinet installation techniques; however, persons who possess such skills would largely find this book unnecessary.  What you do get in this book is lots of line drawings of how to stack and arrange cabinets in different configurations, but these drawings are much like the ones you can get through the design services that are provided by Lowe's, Home Depot, and other major home supply stores. A better choice would be "Built-In Furniture: A Gallery of Design Ideas".  
 From what I noticed, this book comes with few examples, which I need to learn well. However, I learned the same topics originally with Calculus by James Stewart (fifth edition), which comes with very clear explanations, diagrams, and examples. Then the practice problems start off easy and then gradually increase in difficulty. Instead of Kaplan's Advanced Calculus, the James Stewart book is highly resourceful and I would recommend it to any student in calculus, because it can work for practically anyone. 
 While the author certainly has insights and interesting things to say about the city of Mumbai, his style of writing is nothing short of painful.  Sentences are carelessly constructed.  Topics bounce from one topic to another on every page, sometimes within paragraphs.  Many sentences don't make any sense at all and words are often used incorrectly.    I read this for my book group and found it to be a real struggle.  I found myself irritated with the author from the outset and a bit astonished that this book, that has been promoted so aggressively, did not undergo a much needed edit before going to press.    The author strikes me as young, over-eager, and in great need of settling down and focusing 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 The basic idea of this book is that to bring prosperity we should support increased spending on research, and not worry about the federal deficit.  Mandel argues that economic growth comes from technological change, and that we should embrace that.  There are many problems here.  First, how should economic growth be defined and measured?  Mandel admits this is a problem, but he never follows up.  Mandel misses the fact that GDP (the usual measure for economic growth) is a statistic so inaccurate that concluding anything at all from its increases is nearly ridiculous.  For example, GDP doesn't correct for costs of pollution or drawdown of natural resources.  More accurate economic measures, such as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) show that there has been almost no economic growth since the 1970s.  So much for the great boom that technology has brought in the recent past, which Mandel makes so much of.   Mandel mentions several possible technologies as candidates for the Next Big Thing.  In my opinion, Mandel wildly exaggerates the chances of success for these.  I think that if our economy has reached the point where only a huge technological leap can save us, we're in trouble.  We can't be certain that leap will come, or come when we need it.  We'd be riding a tiger that we don't dare let go of. Another problem Mandel misses is that due to widespread externalities, costs are not being transmitted correctly through the market.  When we drive a car, we are not paying for the costs of climate change, or for the cost of building roads or parking lots.  When we buy a computer, we're not paying for the hazardous waste its manufacture creates.  Instead, those costs are being shoved off onto someone else.  Externalities mean that the wrong technologies are being developed. If the externality problem isn't solved, new technologies are likely only to take the economy deeper into a hole.   What evidence is there that "economic growth" as Mandel describes it makes people happy or excited?  Is the economic growth we're trying so hard to get really improving standards of living or making people better off?  Most people I know are working a lot harder than their parents did, with less to show for it.  Health care is stuck in a downward spiral of diminishing returns: vastly more money, health only slightly improved.  The same could be said for many other parts of the economy.   As far as the deficit, I am just not convinced that it is unimportant.  There are plenty of countries out there where fiscal irresponsibility has led to governmental collapse or civil war.  Look at Argentina, for instance.  I don't want that to happen here.        Mandel points out that economic growth would make it easier to do everything, from fighting poverty to saving Social Security.  This is true, but it's like saying that a perpetual motion machine would solve our energy problems.  It would, of course, except that it's impossible.   Mandel does have some good points.  I agree that more support of research may be a good idea. However, we can't rely on it to save our civilization.    Mandel criticizes people like me as technophobic environmentalists.  I'm not afraid of technology; but I see a lot of past technologies that haven't lived up to their billing.  As far as I'm concerned, the technology that we really need to develop now is a more realistic economic science.  America could be in the forefront of this.    
 It is always amusing for me to come across  yet another attempt at "Revisionist Koresh History". In this book the author tries to portray David Koresh as a misunderstood religious leader instead of being the evil sociopath that he truly was.The author attempts to give the reader the "Human side" of Koresh's followers.What he fails to describe that it was all a case of "David , please take my wife and daughter, kindly plunder my Bank Account and that way we won't have to think for ourselves anymore".The author glosses over the numerous Charges of Child Abuse while ignoring the fact that Koresh kept the children for 51 days in a hostile environment where there was no running water, electricy, heat or even decent food. As a negotiator with David Koresh the author failed miserably in respect to not getting the innocent children out of harm's way into the  care of the proper authorities where they could be given a hot meal, a warm bed and a safe place to live far away from conflict and gunfire.The author tries to show the real humanity of those involved and fails because there was no Humanity in that Compound only a thug who hide behind women and innocent hildren and interpreted the Bible through the barrel of a gun 
 If cruelty, sadism, and abuse are to your taste, then this is the film for you.  It is a full-length feature expanded from the bucolic short film, 'Fishbelly White', but which contains none of its lyricism and rural poetry.    Duncan is a 14-year-old misfit known for the chickens that he cares for like pets.  He is isolated and lonely because his mother has just died, and his mono-syllabic father ignores him.  And, in keeping with a time-honored cinematic cliche (starting with `Tea and Sympathy'), he is teased, tortured, and threatened by his macho peers for being 'different'.  It seems that he may have a friend in leader-of-the-pack Perry but this is where the two versions part company.  In the short, they develop a lovely, understated homoerotic romance.  Here, Perry is violent and brutal, like his abusive father, ultimately instigating Duncan's final humiliation.   There is not one moment of tenderness in the entire film until the final 'reconciliation' between Duncan and his father but, considering the unrelenting nastiness which has come before, it feels highly contrived.  Duncan is such a willing, unquestioning `victim' throughout the film, any resolution-of-conflict which might have raised this to a true coming-of-age story is lost.  This is a surprising entry from the usually gay-friendly Showtime Network.  There is nothing friendly about this one. 
 And that's pretty much all this book does. And truly I'd be okay with that if it were at all well written or offered ANY real insight into his method. Y'know how reality shows always spend like one-third of their air time repeating stuff they already told you? This book is like that.   The King of Virgin is clearly a marketing genius. Surely there's another book that does him justice 
 This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film.  Both films have the same borring plot.  THE BORRING PLOT. In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them.  After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.   The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.  If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts.  That film is what I called a good ghost film 
 The fuss over Forrest Gump still amazes me. This movie basically rips off better movies in almost every scene. Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994. Out of all of the movies that were released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20. Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on. The only reason that I would give it props is for(at the time) was the special effects, which now are dated. After Gump Zemekis directed a episode of Tales From The Crypt where he used the same Technology and was easiest the worst episode of that year. I used to be a HUGE Zemekis fan. Used Cars, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Furture movies and Death Becomes Her were I thought were strong movies. But arounf Back to the Future 2  I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film. To the objective viewer re-watch this film and think about every scene and try to remember where you have seen that scene before. I guarantee you after you do that you will see this movie in a totally different light 
 One of the plate I bought broken during a 50 seconds medium heat  microwaving, so I doubt it is really good for microwave. When I called Lenox, their rep. simply asked if I want to order a replacement from them as if the bad quality was not their problem. Disguesting. The design pattern was nice though 
 This book has been the most difficult book I have every used.  I have found more useful information from atlas.asp.net then in this book.  Almost every example that I used has had either old syntax errors or just plain syntax errors.  In spending so much time finding the errors, I feel the book should be called "Where's Atlas" 
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
 I love Catherine Coulter books but this one was disappointing at best. The formula for the book which involves female slavery has been used over and over in historical romances but this plot fails where many others succeed. Mainly because Magnus is such a [jerk] throughout the whole story, he never stops being cruel long enough to make this a good romance novel. If you want a good Coulter book read her bride triology but skip this book 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 I just want to say that I like Belle and Sebastian okay, but I think this is the most pretentious title of any work by anybody in any genre I have ever heard.  I just think that fact sums up the type of music they create and the people that listen to them - pretentious snobs who have their thumbs up their behinds 
 There is a simple story line...but after you learn it the story goes no where...and having a woman with a gun does not save the film..the director of photography gave a nice feel to the film....but the director failed horribly....the actors are pretty, but they can not act...so in essence you are looking at a pretty picture that moves...This is not a movie this is not filmaking...it is almost like an ad for a film that never exists due to amateurs...it would have potential if it had a good director and a better screenplay...hmmm I guess it had no hope...If you want to see great lesbian filmaking and movies worth their price or rental value...go get "Aimee and Jaguar" "When Night Falls" and of course "A Family Affair" which is the #1 lesbian film this year in sales for a reason...and if you want erotica...INESCAPABLE comes out in 2004...viewed as a groundbreaking erotic drama unlike any before it, as  sexy as a film can be and more...."The girl" fails but there is hope for the future!! 
 I read constantly and mostly light murder mysteries-meaning nothing gory etc. Gone was very boring and I believe so is because there are just too many characters-It was difficult to keep them all straight.There didn't seem to be much of a plot until practically the end.I have read Mr Kellerman's books before and found them a lot more enteraining than this one. Also he uses words I never heard before to describe something,rather than stopping to look it up I would have to guess, otherwise I'd lose what little plot there was at the time. Also I get offended when the dirty 4 letter words are used-granted it was only by one character-but neither needed to be in the story line. 
 PHONE BOOTH is a foul mouthed thriller. Period! That's all it is. Nobody real cares about bad boy Colin Farrell and his problems. Give us a central character we can care about. That makes a big difference. I can't help but feel that this film got its inspiration from 1995's NICK OF TIME with Johnny Depp where a similar idea was done much better. 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 I have worked in electronic for 15 yrs, and still couldn't understand what he tried to explain about PIC. but he wrote a lot of books about PIC... 
 I am 37 years old and trying to determine if I (and possibly one of my children) have ADD through both my own research and thorough medical and psychiatric investigation.  This was the fifth book I read on the subject, primarily to gauge the 'flip side' of the arguments in this area.  All authors are entitled to write their own opinion, it is their book, however I encourage potential buyers to do some research about this author and her biases and to formulate their own opinions to determine how much weight to attach to this information as it is presented.  I struggled to agree with much of the content as it does (as advertised) run contrary to most everything else I've read and most everything I've experienced personally.  I further don't believe there was any earth-shattering revelations nor reasoned counter-arguments to the mainstream ADD body of knowledge 
 I love werewolves, and I eagerly bought this book though wanted to return it when I was finished. This book, though beautifully written, has flat, one-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and majorly underdeveloped relationships. Kern and Ainsy barely knew each other and they rushed into sex just like that. Ainsy started out as a strong female character, sometimes snappish but a sweetheart on the inside, and she ends up a helpless damsel in distress when I expected her to tell off the harper and give him a good slap. The plot was thin, with not enough emotion, and the characters simply go with the flow, never developing their own characteristics. But the prose is excellent and breath-taking; I'd like to read other books from this author, though I'll check them out from a library first. The author has a fantastic way with words 
 Not at all what I wanted.  It is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you don't want them pushed.  Ordered 2 and plan to return them.  I usually don't even bother to write a bad review; I just don't write one, but in this case I'll make an exception.  Yuk!  Actually, I rate it at a "0" but there was no "0" selection. 
 If Bell left out any cliches I would be surprised. From terrible dialog, laughable stereotyping of characters, ridiculous plot with an unlikely (to say the least) coincidence, to one of the most (unintentionally) comic finales this book has it all.    
 This Pride and Prejudice fan was hoping for a modern-day movie with a storyline much closer to Pride and Prejudice.  Even Colin Firth could'nt save this one for me!  On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor.   If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version.  Both are excellent.  I would'nt waste my time again with this one 
 I WAS LOOKING FOR A GRANDER INSPERATION AND IT WAS NOT THERE.  SOME NICE SHOTS BUT NOT WORTH BUYING 
 "Looking inside" above shows you the old version of this book, not the N10-003 version. You might not notice that this book has been updated though. It tells you that there are 72 questions on the test and that you have to score a 664 (?) to pass. In reality (I just took the test yesterday (and passed)), there are 85 questions and you only need a 554 to pass.  Some of the information supplied is contradictory, incorrect or not updated: the book only talks about Bluetooth v.1 at 720kps when v.2 is out and offers 2.45mbps. Other network+ books have this newer info.  The most reliable and realistic part of this book is the MeasureUp CD. Don't expect to be able to find the answers to some of these test questions in the Exam Cram book though; they're not there.   Bottom-line: You can probably pass the test with just this book, but you will run into questions mentioning things that are totally absent from the book. Spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 This book was cute, but lacked real useful information and descriptions of techniques, moves and etiquette essential to holding your own in the water.  Maybe because the authors run a surf school, they didn't want to give away all the good information that you pay a lot more for when you sign up for their school.  This book was like a big advertisement for the surf school with extra tips about matching your bikini and toenail polish to your board.  I appreciated the part about doing your part to keep the oceans clean, but that was the meatiest part of the book.  I purchased two books for beginning female surfers at the same time.  The other one was fabulous and I refer to it as a reference constantly.  This one is more useful as a beach read on a flat day.  
 I have never seen a WORSE production by National Geographic than this.  I have lost respect for them after this awful DVD. They did not do their homework, nor did they connect the dots.  Very disappointing.  Watch "9/11 - In Plane Sight" instead 
 I would have to say that I don't particularly agree with this book.  I mean, in my opinion, the most important thing about an apple is that it is food, not that it is round.  Regardless, it did provide for an interesting conversation in my 2nd grade class, as well as a fun get-to-know-you activity.  After reading the book, disucssing differing view points, each student created a page about "The most important thing about me is_____".  
 I used to admire this woman.  She was smart.  She inspired me when I was young.  It is a shame, however, to see her intellectual decline in her last years.  Was this the effect cancer had on her brain?  First, I can't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called "The Force of Reason."   She appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality.  Second, she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts.  For instance, she quietly forgot the role of Christianity in the Conquest of the Americas and the slaughter of the Indian races.  Or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the European powers.  And what about the survival of Catholicism in Spain in spite of eight centuries  of Muslim domination?  Yes, there were churches and  synagogues in Muslim Spain.  This manifesto doesn't look very different from those fascists wrote about Jews in Europe in the 1930s.   Poor woman.  
 this movies horribl;e its so stupid the babies are gross and sooooooooooooooo annoing see spongebob or hey arnold or fairly odd parents skip this 
 Marjane Satrapi is an Iranian born artist/writer known for her autobiography Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, and Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return.  Her success with these graphic novels is that the reader can depend on Satrapi's words AND images to tell  HER story.    And obviously. Satrapi is the world's expert on... Satrapi!  Chicken with Plums is another's story, that of her great-uncle, Nasser Ali Khan, a well-respected musician.  It is speculative at best (thoughts going through Nasser Ali Khan's mind as he "wills himself to death," but Satrapi passes it off as biography.  Here is where this genre as non-fiction flops:  A "cartoon" panel with a simple drawing of a young girl (her) looking sad gives me a message of how she is feeling, but a similar panel of her uncle (whom she would barely know) looking sad then appears... "cartoonish".  Seriously, what would Satrapi know what is going through the mind of a suicidal man?  The story seemed shallow, and the simplistic illustrations did the story a disservice.  However, don't let this review put you off from looking over the two Persepolis books.  They are an interesting (but incomplete by themselves) addition to the literature on life under a repressive government (Iran following the fall of the Shah of Iran) 
 This book may be as well called "the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls".  The author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories.  However, if you are a self-help reader like me who is used to David Allen's "Getting Things Done", you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can 
 Solomon's is a well-written book that begs the question: How many ways are there to say that it is cold in winter at Antarctica?  Solomon builds a molehill of meteorological data that pales in comparison to mountains of other evidence.  Scott's lack of provisions, inadequate marking of depots, splitting of teams, depoting of ski and evaporation of stored fuel are not the only problems with his journey.  Scott apologists lay the journey's failure  and death of the party on the bad weather encountered at the end. They fail to note that 2 companions had already died by the last encampment and the last (Evans) party barely made it back 3 weeks earlier (for the same reasons listed above).  The sheer fact of the matter is, that on a journey of over FOUR MONTHS, Scott had barely FOUR DAYS of extra rations for a job requiring 5000 calories per man per day.  A 3% margin of error in the coldest, windiest, least hospitable corner of the globe is hoping on more than luck.. 
 Two previous reviews, "World-class hype - ordinary book", and "Good Concept, Amatuerish Writing" sum up the situation well.  None of the characters are complete, and we learn nothing of the character's "internals".  They simply move about, do things, and talk to each other while the author blandly describes their surroundings.  The book reads like a screenplay (and perhaps that's what it is).  There's not much I can add to those two reviews, but I wanted to add one more cautioning voice against the numerous blurbs within the book and those found here.  There's a caveat: I bailed after just under two hundred pages and I suppose it's possible that this thing turns into a real marvel at some point beyond that, but I don't see how.  I will say that any comparison to Neal Stephenson, however, is just ridiculous.  "Snow Crash" eats this thing's lunch without breaking a sweat.    
 The washcloths are "ok" but I was really expecting a thicker more absorbent washcloth that holds a lot of soap while in the shower. Good for the money I guess 
 I was very dissapointed in this book.  It talked about how food allergies make us sick with very few specifics and no real info on how to go about fixing it. There are no references, though many exist.  It is just an ad for their test.  [...].  Don't waste your money 
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 As an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, I was very disappointed in Mr. Brands' book. It appeared to me that Mr. Brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic's point of view. While any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man, Mr. Brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of TR's actions. TR was by no means a perfect man, however, history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents. One gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of TR that Mr. Brands'truly disliked his subject 
 I love the Ipod when it works, but I have had three die on me out of the blue.  I have taken care of all of them.  They have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures.  It's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for Applecare.  That's definitely worth it.  If you have not already invested in getting your music onto Itunes, look closedly at other MP3 players before getting locked into Ipod.  At this point, I have 6000 songs rated on Itunes.  It would take too much time to switch 
 Being a big Eastwood fan, I bought this unseen and watched it for the first time last night.  Eastwood is great, as always, although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles.  Locke's acting is over-the-top and annoying, as always.  This is a pretty good action movie, but the ending is ridiculous.  After blasting the hell out of this bus, the cops are just going to let Eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband?  I mean, no one says a word to him.  And on top of that, he takes the assistant d.a. hostage and Locke's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire Phoenix police department, and nobody does a damn thing?  Are you kidding?  I'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies, but give me a break.  This ain't no academy-award winner.  Eastwood is the only thing saving this turkey 
 Ms. Hooks--her affected name which she writes in lower case for reasons left unexplained to readers--shouldn't complain so much about feeling "marginalized" in the "white male academy": this book shows she is deeply embedded in it. She has mastered the old academic game: heavily criticizing "the system" while at the smae time extracting a comfortable living from it. She is indeed "insurgent" if you definite insurgency as holding a job in a prestigious liberal arts college. She is "progressive" if that progress involves studious avoidance of any involvement in organized efforts to change things (she lionizes "theory" in one typically rambling chapter, no doubt seeing her passive, shallow intellectualism as some kind of powerful political movement). All of us who are REALLY interested in political change should abandon the writing of people like Ms. Hooks and listen to people who, rather than simply thinking for a living, actually DO something 
 This is another love fluke set in a sci-fi enviroment for the sake of thrill. It would've been better, maybe, if it would've kept to the normal decor... Humans colonized an alien leftover planet, then were cut off from earth. They managed to survive and develop a sixth sense.  Most of them are ghost-hunters or "tanglers", able to spring psychic traps left in the alien ruins. Lydia Smith is a tangler who has to find an ancient heirloom of Emmet London's. She's ready for a love affair and he's the right guy , in the right place. Love affair unfolds. Some things happen. Emmet is searching for a missing nephew. Lydia stumbles upon him. Then everything ends happily. Stupid book, stupid plot. Not recommended. 
 I was absolutely thrilled with volumes 1-4 in this series. This was, stylistically, more jazzy than chill. It has been a couple years since they released a chill colection. I think that after the feedback they got on this one, they gave up. Nooooo- Just bring back the producers on 1-4 
 Reading this book is a little like reading the Kama Sutra. Both books discuss fascinating subjects but readers are given far more information than they are ever likely to use in practice.  Some critical weaknesses. First, there is the number of metrics: there are 114 (and some metrics are divided into sub-metrics, too). Another problem is that while the authors describe a broad range of metrics and scales, they are often less than informative as to how measurement is to be accomplished. They maintain, for example, that brand awareness should be measured on a scale of 1-7; but they give little information on how this notoriously sensitive subject can be quantified accurately. The same is true of metrics such as customer intentions and loyalty.  Finally, does this book really solve the problem of how to measure marketing performance or payback? On the whole, it does not. Nor does it discuss the key decisions that managers must make about marketing, and this lack of decision-orientation is the biggest weakness of the book.  Managers need guidance that links with real world decisions.    Much better alternatives are: - Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949) - Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847 
 This book is as far from the title as you can get.  It's somewhere between Dr. Phil, an Einstein lecture and a Mensa meeting.  !0% of the writings related directly to the title, the other 90% was as far way as you can get.  That's where you should be from this book. 
 Best thing in the book was the cover photo. I think that most people think of metal and colored glass, stones, etc when they think of making jewelry. This book had little to interest someone who wanted to make or learn something like that-but my friends who are weavers, or who knit, LOVED it. My friends who make jewelry hated it.  It is possible to do all of these fiber techniques with metal instead of fiber, (ie: Arlene Fisch, Mary Lee Hu, Barbara Berk, etc.) and that is what I  thought the book would be about.  It was disappointing. I loved the piece on the cover 
 Should be titled 'Art of Selling Products, Making Hundreds By Manipulating Prospects'. Excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off.  A big disappointment for fee-based planners or advisors looking to expand  their client base. It deals more with manipulating prospects over the phone  than with practical face-to-face financial services sale 
 This book was recommended to me by an accupuncturist who did a great job on my back.  I found it contradictory and ultimately confusing to the point of being useless.  Readers are encouraged to diagnose themselves as being damp or dry, warm or cold, with an interior or exterior issue, and with an excess or a deficiency.  (There may be more categories, that's all I can remember now.)  The main problem with the book is that if one is, say, both damp and cold (which Pitchford states is a common combination) then the dietary advice is contradictory.  One chapter says to eat raw vegetables, the next says no.  One says eat meat, the next says no.  One says fruit, the next says no.  One stresses brown rice, the next says very little brown rice.  In addition, being too far along one axis is the same as being the opposite condition.  If you just said "Huh??" then get used to it if you order this book.    Lastly, the big puzzle to me in reading all these 5 star reviews is that not one person (unless there is a review I missed) discusses how their health was improved, how they lost weight, anything!  Isn't that really the proof of a book on dietary recommendations?    Bottom line:  eat whole foods, not processed, organic if possible, and a variety of produce, whole grains, and small portions of lean meat.  I just saved you 700+ pages of reading and $30-something.  And you're welcome. 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 this is by the numbers film making,and as such has no place in the lonesome dove story. with few of the origanl cast back it falls to other actors to take up the parts ,and yes jon voight is a good actor but he can't hold a candle to tommy lee jones and his turn as call. all in all this one misses the mark!!! 
 I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it 
 Bonavoglia examines the modern Catholic Church and women that are making great strides to change the woman's role in the church.  This book highlights a number of different women and the actions they have taken in an attempt to influence the Church's hierarchy to be more inclusive and accepting of women in significant Church roles.  It also emphasizes the multitude of examples where women have been blatently excluded and discouraged, if not prevented, from taking a more active role in the Church.  Topics addressed include the Church's position and reaction to pedophilia, rape, contraceptives, abortion, sex, and women's ordination.  What had potential to be a stirring and thought provoking book turned into a chore to read.  I found the writing to be disjointed and personal stories slammed into the middle of some fact and some author opinion.  What this book was able to do was highlight some of the actions of the Church that are truly disappointing revelations in today's modern age.  However, the impact of these revelations was lost in the boring writing surrounding them.  The epilogue is the only part of the book that really flows and stirs some emotion.  But for the last two pages of the book I would have rated it with 1 star only 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 This thing does not stay in place. I needed a sponge to prop it up. Also don't let the chrome finish fool ya. It's plastic all around and feels cheap. Right now this is in a box going right back where it came from. No good.   
 First of all, when I think of someone in law enforcement or in a government involved job, especially negotiating, I think of someone really tough. With that kind of job, you have to be. The main character was an enormous whimp. In a book centered around a character in the middle of the crossfire and involved in a job as dangerous as negotiating, that is unacceptable. If she gets squeamish after only one job, well then, how'd she get where she was in the first place? Her negotiating tactics and attempts at talking with the bad guy were pathetic. Also in that horrendous scene was the moment when she met the main male character in the book. I never knew that I would gag so much in just a couple of paragraphs alone. On one side there's the author constantly praising the main characters so-called fearless attitude and on the other the guy in the story's doing the exact same thing. I found it all to be quite disgusting.   I didn't like the main character. And then there were the conversations: who talks like that? Everything about the entire story was so unrealistic, the plot, characters, storyline, dialogue...And it seemed as if every other paragraph they were getting something to eat. I have never read another book where they ate more. They ate more than I do in the time it takes me to read ten books, much less a single one.  I have noticed a pattern with Dee Henderson. Her female characters are always extremely dependant on their male heroes. They seem to turn to mush around them, so if you're looking for a strong female character, turn around and look somewhere else.    Overall: One of the most annoying books I have read in a long time 
  The book is manipulative and unrealistic. I felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey, betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend.  Definitely one of the shallowest books I have ever read.  I bought the book as it was rated as a "best seller" , and I was stuck in an airport for hours on end. The entire plot is hideous as the "burned best friend" makes up reasons why it's accept able to betray her best friend. If I was not completely bored, I would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages. 
 This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62!  The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory. 
   Ya sure they have some good tunes on here. But as far as making this the 1 Guns cd,with every killer tune they did. This falls short by mile!   There isnt one song from Lies,Lies,Lies on here. Just another way for Axel to squeeze another buck outta of the fans. Fan? Any die hard Guns fan should be disapointed 
 This is a field guide to the foreign land of our parents - a help & resource as our elders age & we must talk with them about medicine, hygiene, dependence, selling the car, loneliness & love. This book jumped into my hand because it's all about what we're doing right now -  taking care of our Poppa in his final years. While Poppa's son speaks his  father's language & can mostly get his frames of references, there are  over 40 unknown years before his son was a twinkle in his Poppa's eye.  Meanwhile I have only a smattering of references with this plodding  mischievous fellow who avoids saying yea or nay.  He also has an endless  well of stories about anything & these should be told to a bevy of  youngsters at his knees. I also know now that we're not at fault for his  oldness nor is it our job to make him happy. Only he can do that. It is our  job, however, to keep ourselves happy! This book has some eminently useful  information, strategies & ideas. Well done 
 I'm a long-time collector of Froud and a WOF member. This book was purchased by my husband from my Wish List. I was delighted to receive it but was very disappointed in the quality of the edition. A complete set of 24-pages was missing and replaced with a duplicate set. Amazon's Customer Service (always great to work with) sent a replacement immediately but that book was also a a printing disaster. All the graphics had inappropriate color bled into the images (excessive blue, yellow, red). Definitely not acceptable in a book purchased not only for it's amusing text, but particularly for it's artwork. I returned it also as Amazon could not guarantee me an edition without the printing errors.  As usual, they issued a total refund (thanks amazon) 
 Looking for a trend following system? You won't find one in this book.  Developing one and need some assistance?  No help here either.  The critical areas of system development are not covered (What to buy or sell, How much to buy or sell, When to buy or sell, When to get out of a losing position, and When to get out of a winning position).  This book contains a shallow analysis of successful trend followers and their techniques 
 Palms have nice user interfaces. This is my second Palm PDA. The screen is excellent, and it is thin and light. The software works well, and synchronizes without problems to Windows XP Home and XP Professional. Unfortunately, after two years the on-off switch has failed. This requires me to use one of the "hot" buttons to turn it on. This allows me to continue to use this device, but it is annoying and inconvenient (these are all about convenience, right?). My first Palm device, an M130, also had its on-off switch fail after two years (before its main board failed). Palm needs to understand that I have other things to do with my money than to spend $200 every two years on a PDA because they didn't make the on-off switch robust enough. One should want to buy a new PDA because of new features and design, not because of mechanical failure. This device has been well taken care of and has not been abused. My wife's Treo 700p had its speaker fail after 45 days, and occasionally the phone portion requires a reset. Although I have not had any problems with Palm software, my IT consultant tells me that the Palm software does not synchronize well with the Windows Tablet operating system. Although I would have liked to stay with the Palm OS, because of the mechanical failures of my two Palms and the Treo 700p, my next PDA will probably be from HP.  
 I bought this book thinking that it would be something different and interesting.  I like fairy stories but the book was so not what I expected.  It was more the story of a bunch of dirty little children that go out and kidnap other children and take their places so they can live boring lives in which they are so bored with their own existence they have to go in search of the lives they had before they were originally stolen to become dirty little children.  Not really interesting, very little plot, extremely predictable, and a stupid ending.  My friend and I read this at the same time and we both agreed it was not worth the money 
 The exam is relatively straighfoward, but the questions are not as stupid as the ones in the book.  Example: "What is the name of the port provided by some older computers that transmits data serially"  HMM THATS A TOUGH ONE.   Heres another:   What program will "diskmgmt.msc" open  A. Disk Management B. Control Panel C. Command Prompt D. Registry  Don't buy this book. Theres plenty of other better books out there.  
 This is a review of the New Media/Cinevu release, not the dubbed Dimension one.  Do not buy this movie - this product should be pulled immediately as it seems to be an incomplete bootleg not even containing the whole movie. That should be sufficient warning there, but if you must know why, read on.  I was hesitant at first to buy this DVD, as all other reviews - both good and bad - seem to be of the Deimnsion version. I'm not sure why these two seperate products are linked to the same page for comments, but they are.  In short, this DVD is horrible. The only good thing is that it is in the original language - unfortunately, the subtitles - both Chinese and English - are hard coded into the screen, so you have to deal with both subtitles being up there. Secondly, the transfer is atrocious - so bad, in fact, that the hardcoded subtitles are so blurred its virtually impossible to read them (that's not even including the very small font used). The bad transfer also applies to the picture in general, giving it a low quality that makes the worst of TV show DVDs look like painted masterpieces.  There are no bonuses, sound options, or in fact any menus. The set up is bare minimum and the presentation so horrid that I feel as if I paid 15$ for a bootleg from Amazon, and I would not be surprised if in fact this IS a bootleg, as I can find no information on this New Media company or even this release of the DVD outside of Amazon.  But somehow, for some reason, I bore through this to continue on with the movie. Taking great effort I could make out the subtitles and grimey picture enough just to realize that the movie ends at 47 minutes - in an hour and a half movie. So not only is the transfer horrible, but it is incomplete, literally cutting off in the middle of the movie. This isn't a criticism about the editing, mind you, but the DVD actually just suddenly ends as if they didn't bother to burn the entire movie onto the DVD.  I will be emailing Amazon about this shortly, but I must urge all people to avoid this DVD, the reasons being clear - you aren't even getting the movie you paid for, its literally not all the way on the disc 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 I tried it on 4 laptops, and none of them was able to sustain the signal. It kept on dropping out! Mind you, two of the internal cards did a much better job than it.  
 The different authors write different chapters defining some things differently.    The material is outdated, you'll constantly have to update their junk to make it work.  Way too verbose and bouncing back and forth within an individual chapter (just try those two early BMP/CMP chapters).  It's just not worth $1.  Use the sun tutorials for a much better and much much clearer start.  
 I would suggest that any reader wishing to learn about bonds in any detail other than the most simplistic, will be utterly disappointed. It was a waste of money, if I may be so blunt.   Malcolm Yellon 
 This is not good literary exegesis, it is an unabashed apologia for a literary bureaucracy, another pamphlet of the endless "literary production" under the pseudo-Marxist homology of poststructuralism. It ends up merely as a political struggle to save Kafka for purposes of cultural and intellectual identity.    This book purports to get at "the real Kafka," by stripping the man and his work of all transcendent pretensions assigned him by critics of the old school, by making him a model for the new uniformed postmodernist-socialist man. In "Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature," Deleuze and Guatarri have done the same things they accuse the old Kafkologists of doing, in effect stripping Kafka of his old Kafkalogical baggage only to create a new Kafkology, one that focuses more on a weird interpretive biography of the man as celebrity than it does by trying to understand his works in their modernist setting.    
 I just paid $15 dollars (after shipping) for this cheap looking plastic popcorn bowl that was supposed to be a gift for my sister. Bah Humbug!!! Did I mention it is plastic. IT'S PLASTIC!!!! 
 This volume would have carried a lot more weight if the proofreaders had done their jobs correctly. The many typos detracted from the sometimes useful text. The TV show Bewitched became Bewitch and near the end of the book a page just ended in the middle of a sentence. The next page started a new sentence and thought. Overall I liked what he had to say but I couldn't get past the errors. It just lost its authority with all the sloppiness. 
 I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money.   
 This book is a piece of literary trash.  At 5 inches by 7 inches and 130 pages of size 12 type, it can be read in an evening.  But what a waste of an evening!  It contains nothing more than anecdotal stories from grade c sci-fi movies.  No facts or scientific discussion-just a lot of BS falderal.  No wonder there are NO recommendations by her peers.  The reader would be much better off reading Wolfe or another genuine author 
 That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her 
 the book started out really strong. stories (vignettes/chapters/whatever) about her childhood and crap that happened to her. not like, abuse, but seeing a fat girl at summer camp receive head--stuff like that.  and then it degenerated into a mommy blog.  i can't get pregnant. blah infertility. blah we're pregnant. blah we went on vacation and my son doesn't love the boob. blah he loves it again.  frankly, i don't care.  interspersed with the baby crap, there were some stories about her grandma and her alzheimers. those were good.  i could have done with a lot more grandma stories or childhood stories and a lot less about pregnancy and having a kid.  the stuff that wasn't baby related was really good though 
 BORING.  I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book 
 There are two things which tickle me about this book.  One is the sample Zack's report at the back which has a strong buy #1 rating on a -.3% return on equity stock.  The other is the section on practical use of the system.  It, of course, is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 - 3 months.  And don't forget about growth investors and value investors either.  This section is so short as to be laughable.  Also notice that in the 2002 A list there were 216 stocks.  Most are going to have to buy a subset.  But what subset?  No info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class.  Perhaps an MVO addict or a Monte Carlo hack would have the answer 
 I read this book and was very disappointed in that it did not cover ONLY the movie version of the Phantom.  I was not interested in anything about the stage version that was in the book.  Considering the price the book should have been larger.  I also thought there should be more pictures of the Phantom who is the true star of the film 
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 I bought this and within ten minutes it failed.  I was completely dissappointed with this purchase.  I loved the concept, but the product is cheap and will not hold up to normal use.  Lesson learned 
 This book is out of date, and the "famous director tales" are only a few pages in length each.  Not worth the money.  Would be interesting to see how this book would look if were written today, with the  impact of DV 
 I agree with Mr. Oshell on almost every point. I find John Calvin, in this writing, and in many others, confused about what he really believes.  He speaks of 'justification', 'sanctification', regeneration', 'grace', even 'faith', but cannot seem to come to an agreement with himself as to what these important terms mean.  After reading a good amount of the Institutes, I think John Calvin thought they all meant the same thing.  But of course, according to Calvinism, knowing about these things was ever meant for most of the world anyway, and knowledge of them doesn't make any difference to anyone's eternal destiny, so really, what does it matter who does or doesn't understand these terms?  The reader might find his eyes spinning in his head after a short while.  Much philosophy indeed....  John Calvin, like Calvinist writers in general, must of necessity give opposite meanings to the words of the living God in Scripture in order to teach what it is they believe, "Calvinism".  But I think any true 'believer' should be horrified by Calvin's notion that salvation and damnation of individuals are utterly left to chance, a decision already made by God for each of us before the foundation of the world, and most importantly, arbitrary in regard to "faith". God merely made the decision without any regard to His foreknowledge of a person's faith or lack of faith in Christ.  Unbelievable.  But this teaching comes from Calvin's belief that there IS no condition for salvation, that faith in Christ is not necessary for those 'elected' by God to salvation in eternity past.  God, they say, simply "gives the gift of faith" to the ones He has already elected to salvation (making them meet the apparent condition for salvation (faith) in John 3:16-18).  To hell with the rest, literally.    Is it any wonder that Calvinism has never enjoyed any peace in Christian circles?  The 'goodwill' of Calvinism's gospel is simply not meant to be goodwill to 'all'.  As for spiritual deception, Mormonism and the Watchtower Organization can't hold a candle to the brilliant deceptions of Calvinism.  Let me emphasize "BRILLIANT".  Calvin's Institutes turns truth on its head.  Just do as the Bereans did and never fail to compare what Calvin says in his Institutes with the word of God to see if they are in agreement.  What I found in Mr. Calvin's writings was 'the word of men' we read about in 1 Thes 2:13.  It is difficult for me to accept the fact that otherwise intelligent men would even 'want' to believe Calvin's horrible teachings. But its true, one's faith is a thing of the heart, and we can all believe whomever and whatever we want (I made the free will choice to reject John Calvin's teachings).      
 This cable did not fit my camera as stated.  Because of the cost factor, I chose not to return it.  The shipping was more than the cable was worth 
 This year, 60% of college entries will be female.  Look at this spring's honor role listings.  Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female.  Schools are fails boys - not girls.  If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book.  If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 The book I read is called How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. The book is basically about these four sisters named Carla, Sandi, Yolanda and Sofia, and their mother and father, Carlos and Laura. They wanted to move away from their little island to live a better life. Once they moved to New York, the girls got homesick, and they hated the fact that they are living there. People called them hurtful names and that made it worse for them, and they didn't feel very welcome. The chapters are set up differently then most books I've read. Each of the chapters are about how each character feels about New York, and what they did to fit in. Honestly I didn't really like the book because, first of all, it dragged and the author Julia Alvarez didn't get to the point right away. Also, the way she did the chapters was so confusing because she kept on switching the characters. I would recommend this book to people who speak Spanish. I wouldn't recommend this book to people who don't speak Spanish or people who hate books that drag.  
 The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad 
 Sad to say, I to agree with the previous reviewer - this book is a real disappointment.  Of course the title is incredibly vague, and is in one sense entirely true even if the authors merely mention both storytelling and organizations in passing.  They don't - in order to justify this title - have to tell us anything at all ABOUT storytelling or organizations.  Though having said that, I suspect that the title will lead most people to EXPECT to learn something about the use of storytelling in organisations, the what, the when, the why and the how.  Unfortunately, as the previous reviewer comments, only one of the four authors comes anywhere near meeting these expectations.  The book, which comes in at just under 200 pages - just under 180 if you ignore the index, the potted biographies and the "Further Reading" list - is divided into just six chapters.  Chapter 1 consists of 4 descriptions of "How I came to Storytelling" - one by each author. Chapters 2-5 inclusive are each allocated to a different author and consist, as far as I can tell, of (a) the transcript of the person's presentation at a conference on storytelling held in  2001, followed by the author's "reflections" approximately four years later. Chapter 6 is a "wrap up" chapter by Steve Denning on "The Role of Narrative in Organizations."  First problem - the way someone talks in a presentation should be quite different from the way they write the same information.  Apart from anything else, repetition is useful and necessary in a presentation - it can be boring and frustrating in a written text.  And that is certainly the case throughout most of this book.  Second problem - although the authors occasionally mention what one of their co-authors has said/written, the text doesn't link up particularly well.  Indeed, there seems to be a remarkable lack of agreement as to what this book is about.  Maybe the title wasn't dreamed up until after all the draft manuscripts were in?  In Chapter 2, Larry Prusak appears to be talking and writing about business communications in general - and Larry Prusak.  He certainly mentions "story" from time to time, but only a couple of days after reading his chapter I couldn't for the life of me remember anything that struck me as being the least bit significant about it.  Chapter 3, by John Seely Brown, likewise deals with business communications, though he does get as close to storytelling as the proverbial exchanges of information around the water cooler and the mobile phone equivalent.  Whilst this is certainly valid, to still be making it a key point in a chapter on storytelling in 2004 seems extremely "old hat."  Again, the chapter made no lasting impression as far as I was concerned.  Chapter 4, Steve Denning's initial chapter, was the first to actually address "storytelling," as such, IMO.  It certainly contains a few interesting pieces of information and some helpful examples, and if it had been supported by chapters of a similar calibre from Denning's co-authors then I'd be giving the book a 4 star rating at least. By itself, however, even when taken in conjunction with the wrap up chapter, Denning's contributions aren't enough to save the book, as a whole, from being thoroughly mediocre.  Just for completeness, Chapter 5, by Katalina Groh, seems to be primarily a major excercise in blowing a trumpet for her own film company.  Although she does make two or three important comments on storytelling, there is just so much repetition and waffle in this chapter that the good stuff is quickly buried by the dross.  Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the book is how little any of the authors - including Denning - seemed to understand about "how" to tell stories - which is maybe why that topic receives such scant coverage. For example, at one point Denning comments on his idea as to why storytelling is more effective as a way of conveying information compared with a simple presentation of facts and figures.  The crux of the matter, he tells us, on page 170, is that:  "We remember what is in a story because our feelings are reached and because the listener becomes personally involved with the story."  Well, that's open to discussion.  Not all stories automatically inspire a particularly emotional response, yet even then stories tend to be more easily remembered than plain facts and figures.  Why?  Because information is more easily remembered when it has a clear framework which makes it a coherent whole. In storytelling the story itself is the framework.  A list of facts and figures only becomes a whole if (a) a framework is provided along with the information, or (b) the listener already knows the context in detail, and/or (c) the listener is in any case used to receiving and dealing with information presented in this format.  Overall, a very underpowered and unsatifactory book.  
 "So does the author work for the RIAA?" Was my first thought when poking throught this book. Nice content overall, but I simply cannot recommend this book based on one thing alone : The author uses the term "stealing" when discussing copyright infringement. Get it straight! There is a clear legal difference between 'stealing' and 'infringement'. To state things in this manner is not only misleading, but an out-and-out intentional falsehood. Just because the author feels a certain way does not make it law. In this day and age, there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for using incorrect terms like this in a book specifically about the legal aspects of music. Thumbs way down: 
 The premise here is so engaging that I'm not surprised the author got it published, but basically, it's such a self-indulgent ramble that it's not worth the time of people other than the author.  How can a person make the topic of James Bond and his 'disturbing world' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first 100 pages?  If you'd like to know, read the first hundred pages of this book.  Like many, I came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read.  We're talking about James Bond here after all.  The author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously, and that's fine, but in that case, we shouldn't have to be bored.  I would strongly recommend not reading this book.  It could have been covered in a long magazine article or, as I said, as the occasional comment on a blog about James Bond 
 It takes a peculiar kind of fortitude to plow through this overworked tale of the tortuous search for an object that is no more than a curiosity. Long before I reached the middle of the book, I was asking myself, "Why are you reading this thing?" I suppose the answer is that I wanted to see the search carried to a successful conclusion. I began skipping the sections of meaningless esoterica (written, I feel sure, to bring the book to its desired 360 pages exactly) and labored on to an ending that one reviewer here called "no payoff." To give one example of the tedious sort of preciosity that gave birth to this novel, I can tell you that sections within chapters are divided by a small geared wheel whose four spokes begin in chapter one as just a few degrees off from upright, gradually rotate clockwise until they're upright, then past upright, until one by one they return to the upright--in the final chapter. I'm sure the author loved this little conceit, possibly noticed by ten readers besides myself 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this book...  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't interested in a kiss and tell look into her life, but I have a feeling Tweed is much more interesting and entertaining than what this book suggests.  Most of the book covers her live moving from Canada to LA boucing from boring boyfriend to even duller boyfriend.  She finally meets Gene Simmons and she tells us how good there life is etc.  But she is obviously a hard worker, a survivor in LA movies, mixes with interesting people and is part of an intriguing relationship with Simmons - but there is little detail.  I found the "Family Jewels" DVD series far more satisfying and complimentary about her life.  For fans only.. 
 I bought this blender because I liked its retro design, and I thought it would function well.  Well, every single time I've tried to use it has been a disaster.  Even for very simple tasks, like blending soft avocado, the blender has not worked. The blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything... It's horrible.  And I even threw away my old, ugly blender when I bought this one... and the other worked just fine. :  
 not sure a more incredible collection of horse hockey has ever been published.while my masochistic tendencies have led me to read other books by pat robertson,this has to qualify the man for some sort of prize.on the bright side,if the right reverend would release a audio version,it might be helpful in breaking down the will of criminal suspects during hostile interogations.. 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again.  
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 The book is 10% about Jefferson and 90% about the author's far-left political agenda.  I also lost trust in him after reading his criticism of American voters' low turn outs in comparison to Austalia, while failing to mention that in Australia, voting is compulsory.  It makes me wonder how many other self-serving "facts" he used.(? 
 Actually, the book ticked me off. It was probably TOO authentic, contrasting the professionalism of the specops group to the smallminded pettiness of the bureaucrats controlling their assignments. Some good action, and "magic" equipment was interesting. I still like to see the good guys win, not get used by the turkeys 
 This release is boring. What passes for angst is mere whining. Any hooks are few and far between. If a melody should occur, it's telegraphed well in advance by the guitars. It's sort of a musical equivalent of a dying lawn mower - there's a lot of racket but it can't cut it. Sixteen Stone is just what we didn't need more of in the mid-90s: One dimensional primitive blockhead raving. Makes a great coaster, though 
 I've been doing a lot of research about the artist Artemisia Gentileschi, and this movie really doesn't fit the historical data that we do have about this amazing artist and woman.  It's a beautiful movie, but the facts are just wrong, especially concerning her rape by her tutor, Agostino Tassi.  It is unfortunate that the filmmakers chose to portray her in this light, because she was such an amazing, talented, and strong woman.  This movie really dampens her strength and determination by making her into a seductress instead of a victim 
 If Robert Strange McNamara expects to profit from his version of what most of us knew at the time, then further shame on him!   He should make this  available as an e-book, at no charge, to the American people.  I have  little doubt that Amazon.com would accomodate him in this effort 
 I know that as a wolf-lover I am a bit biased, but I would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect.  You see, in this story, three children are left alone.  A wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in, because he wants to eat them.  Unfortunately, that's where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill.  This is just another stupid book that, summed up, says "Wolves are evil, ugly beasts who attack people!!  We have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children!"  Yep, the wolf is depicted as evil in this book.  Why couldn't they make it something that actually hurts people, like a bear or a mountain lion?  Ignorance, that's why.  The wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book.  See, near the end, the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts.  They plan on luring him into their trap, to get rid of him.  The wolf instantly falls for it, which is lame.  Wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on Earth!  It's practically traditional to make children's books with wolves as villains, and the Chinese seem to loath wolves, but this book crosses the line.  Don't let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage, stupid, man-eating beasts.  If they already think so, you'd be neglecting mankind's need to know things even more by letting them read it.  In other words, it's a terrible book. 
 It is rare to see an author tackle such a rich and interesting subject, and write a book so vapid and lacking in content.  The material is "explained" in terms of inept metaphors and vague hand-waving assertions. After devoting several hours to studying the book, the reader has the feeling that he's "been had", since he has acquired nothing in return for his effort.  In fact, the author appears to have no more than the faintest grasp of the subject he is writing about 
 Player's Handbook II is a waste of time and money.  It is a disappointing mish mash of lame executions of potentially interesting concepts 
 To sum it up, this book wasn't much helpful. I'm new to Poser and would like to get started on Poser. The author *plods* through Poser at a snail's pace! I gave it up and am waiting for a better Poser book to come out 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 If you think "Knight of Fire" worth is a read because you enjoyed Shannon Drake's wonderful storyline and characters so much in "Princess of Fire" then don't bother. Unfortunately Knight of Fire is rather boring and the  characters are quite flat. Fallon and Alaric make an appearance, which is  why I bothered to read the book, I was more interested in seeing what had  happened to them in their later years.  If Drake writes another novel about  their children I hope it's about Robin their firstborn son but I'll have to  see what people in Amazon.com have to say about it before I bother to buy  it 
 Anyone that knows anything about Milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs, and contributed much more to society than people like James Stewart, who often act like parasites at the expense of others.  And what about Milken's life after this whole affair? I wonder what Stewart will write about in the sequel, since Milken has taken on a life of philanthropy basically unrivaled, and certainly contributes more to this country than most. Milken's creation of a liquid market for junk bonds allowed credit risk to be redistributed throughout the capital markets, effectively creating more capital, more jobs, and more wealth creation.   Anyone up and coming in IB, or looking to inform themselves of the 80's capital movement, please at least check out some other perspectives on the era.   Note: These comments don't apply to Boesky or the arbs who were doing nothing but breaking the law. I would argue a strong distinction between Milken and most of the other characters in this book 
 A friend of mine just gave me one of these. Knowing I've been working out she figured it might help me on days I don't go to the gym.  I would love to say how much it is or isn't helping me, but I can't even use it! It absolutely will not stay on the doorknob, one little pull and it comes down onto your head! Out of the several times I kept trying to get it to stay, the one time it stayed on for more then a few seconds and I was actually able to try and get my feet in it and came straight down. I'm 5'8" and it is too short for me, how's anyone who's really tall supposed to get it to work. I honestly have to say this product is not very well designed and shouldn't even be on the market. 
 I purchased the Adaptation soundtrack thinking the song from the trailer and the V.W. commercial would be on it. The soundtrack is nothing more than very horrible sounds, nothing from the trailer and very expensive. False advertising at it's best 
 Moore sets out to blame guns, rather than the people who make Prozac and other 'designer' seditives for the massacre at Columbine High School and runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself, Moses, better known as Charleton  Heston. Heston, gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments Moore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftist has v. the Second Amendment. Long live the second Amendment, otherwise the First Amendment is gone, too! Moore should wake and wise up. Better Moore efforts that are highly recom- mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, Roger and Me and even the un- derrated Canadian Bacon 
 Don't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there. This book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases. I guess it lives up to its subtitle of "Life as a Forensic Anthropologist" in that she usually presents only HER part in each case with little presentation of the entire case. The forensic cases are not really the star of this book, the author is. I was frustrated with the lack of depth. Instead, read "The Body Farm" by Bill Bass. Excellent storytelling there! He gives you personal stories, but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated 
 I liked the price of this, but I guess you get what you pay for.  My friends complained that I sounded as though I were underwater.  I returned this product - a real piece of Cr*p.  
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 this is not biography, but libel with a good motive. For an unbiased overview of the polemic about dr. B. see the review "The Strange Case of Dr. B." in the New York Review of Books, Volume 50, Number 3 ? February 27, 2003. (i found it online) 
 This book functions primarily as a large advertisement for the author's seminars/classes. Most of what the book presents is naive, simplistic or just plain wrong. The financial side techniques presented include "tried and true" goodies that don't work now and didn't work when I first read them in a book my dad bought 40 years ago.   The negotiating tactics don't work. See Spin Selling for some of the best sales and negotiating material out there.   Of course, if you are able to deal only with people who are completely ignorant of the real estate values in their town and who distrust lawyers, i.e., don't have contracts reviewed in lieu of using a real estate broker, you may get some of these gems to work for you.  And what do I know? Not much -- but I have appeared in court as an expert appraisal witness, made a few million in real estate (& yes, I still read books. Who knows when I'll find a good idea?) and been a real estate broker for 30 years.  The author, if he ever made any money in real estate, is now, it would seem, making his money selling his seminars. Run, don't walk, away from the author and his materials. 
 Campbell was quite prolific; why would he have published such a very short book? He didn't, actually, it was put together posthumously. Understanding the editor is key to understanding this book.  I found odd that such a short book could nonetheless be so incoherent and incomprehensible. After researching its editor, Eugene C. Kennedy, it made sense. What the publishers of this book don't tell you (don't want you to know?) is that Eugene C. Kennedy was a Catholic Maryknoll priest for 22 years, teaches at the Jesuit Loyola University, and is the author of such classics of humanist mythological studies as "Would You Like to be a Catholic?" and "Cardinal Bernadin's Stations of the Cross". This information puts "Thou Art That" into perspective.  The book starts out with (ex-)Father Kennedy's preposterous assertion that Campbell had some kind of deathbed conversion. Apparently Campbell's wife put Campbell in a Catholic hospital, then claimed that her husband had spent his entire life studying spirituality, mythology, and archetypes without ever once in his life "experiencing emotionally" their meaning... until he saw some kind of Catholic religious image before he died. This sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the "Doctrine of the Faith" department. I very much doubt this happened; the assertion puts Campbell's entire life's work into question. What kind of person could write about something his whole life without ever experiencing it emotionally?  Reading Kennedy's selection of Campbell's works is like reading Thomas Aquinas's selection of Arisotle's works: the result is a confused, disjointed mess, because the material has been gerrymandered in a sometimes desperate attempt to make the author more palatable to Catholic theology. It appears that very little of Campbell's work suits Kennedy's purposes, which would explain why the book is both so short and so fragmentary. At the very least, such an editing misrepresents the author.  Here's some Latin that the editor should have shared with you: "caveat emptor" 
 Anyone interested in the resolution of the Anastasia controversy must also read Peter Kurth's books: "Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson" (ISBN: 0316507172) and "TSAR: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra" (ISBN: 0316557889).  Also read Kurth's direct rebuttal to Massie's "Romanovs" at peterkurth.com, specifically http://www.peterkurth.com/ANNA-ANASTASIA%20NOTES%20ON%20FRANZISKA%20SCHANZKOWSKA.htm  Highlights:  1. The DNA test's techniques are so antiquated that they produce many false positives and negatives.  These techniques are no longer considered accurate enough to be admissible in U.S. courts.  2. The DNA sample from Anna Anderson was taken from a bit of "her" intestine that -- God knows why -- had been sitting on a shelf at the hospital where she had had surgery years earlier.  Where is the "chain of custody" that any legitimate court would require of such evidence?  Thus, the sample tested is suspect.  3. The DNA test results that "prove" AA was a blood relative to Polish peasants in fact PROVES THE OPPOSITE.  According to Massie's geneology, AA was a PATERNAL blood-relative to these Poles.  But the DNA test that was conducted can only trace MATERNAL blood relations.  So a POSITIVE DNA test result "proves" a relationship where none could possibly exist, using Massie's own geneology.  None of this proves that Anna Anderson was Anastasia.  But it does cast serious doubt on the conclusiveness of the DNA test results that Massie champions, and serious doubt about the accuracy of Massie's book 
 It's clumsy, cumbersome, not great quality, and a bad idea. In addition to that, mine will no longer work after very limited use. Wish I could get my money back 
 Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the "reviews" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the "secrets" of such and such product. A "secret" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product 
 This sounds like such a good idea, but in actuality, it doesn't work. The sidwalk chalk and stencils work fine, but the stencils don't work with the "stomperz." The chalk dust comes flying out of these things in every direction and lands on everything *except* the stencil you're trying to make. Your child ends up covered in chalk dust (including up their noses!), but the stencil is still un-chalked. We were SO disappointed with this one! 
 Thriller is the ONE song I like by Micheal Jackson(not counting the Jackson 5) I saw/heard it in 13 going on 30 and thought it had a good beat to it. and when that dude starts talking near the end, some of it goes like this:  Must stand and face the hounds of hell, and rot inside a corpse's shell  Now would you really want some 6 year old listening to that? I bet they don't even have that talking part at the end. Oh, and I would love to know exactly how they got permission from Micheal Jackson : 
 Very disappointed because I can't watch it on my DVD player. I would have asked for a refund and returned it but don't know how to go about doing that on Amazon 
 I just passed the California Brokers Examination on my first try. I am an attorney and have no real estate background and I do not have a real estate sales license.  (In fact I hated Real Property in law school and avoid practicing in this area.)  I read a few primer books including this one to see what would be on the exam.  I read this Barron's book all the way through and answered all of the test questions.  I the took the Real Estate Trainers Course in Santa Ana, on the advise of a girlfriend who is a broker and who took their course. They offer a crash courses in LA, Orange County and in Northern Cal. I took the course, read the big book they give you; did all of the exam questions (Over 1500); attended the crash course seminar twice and took the test.  The courses and practice exams Real Estate Trainers gave, made the test easy.  When I took the Real Estate Trainer's Course I realized that this Barrons book is only good to lay out the general areas that are on the actual test.  However, you can not use this book alone to the pass the test.  The questions in this book are too easy and don't reflect how hard the questions actually are.  You can use it for general information purposes only but some of the areas in the Barron's book overemphasis areas that the actual test spends little or no time on.   In that the pass rate for the exam is between 30 and 38%, I would prepare the best you can.  Save your money and find this book in the local library and check it out.  (Many libraries have it.)  Read and take a brokers exam course 
 I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them.  I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore.  Save your time, read some Dostoevsky, some Dickens, some Milton, (...) 
 Men and women have equal sex drives,deal with it!What makes us  different is the constant shaming women get when they do indeed act sexual.If you have the word "slut" hanging over your head constantly it just might make you want to cling to romance in order to appear less sexual than a man.Gray generalizes,and not only generalizes but makes women out to be sexless objects there to please men and not themselves. He writes as though he has a great fear of men and women being  equal in sex drive.His mysogamist views of women are  disgusting! In short what he says is,the woman only has to look nice for the man,and the man has to romance,begg and trick women into  bed because women in his mind really don't want or need sex. 
 If you are looking to find out about the IMAP protocol - This book is very good, I bought it to help me install the Cyrus imap server. The book covers the installation of cyrus but it does not cover the prerequisites. I found the hardest part of setting up the Cyrus server was dealing with the software prerequisites, i.e. tcl and cyrus sasl.  If you are interested in learning about the IMAP protocol, this is the book, if you are interested in setting up Cyrus - save your money 
 As previous reviewers have commented, this is a very good overview of the CMMI. The authors work in the industry, and have done an admirable job presenting the nuts-and-bolts of this enormous topic in a straightforward fashion. But if you intend to use it as a tool, like you would Paulk's book on the SW-CMM (SM), DON'T BUY IT YET. The editing in Appendix B renders this book useless to me (I need it as a tool). When I compare the constituents of the Process Areas in Appendix B to the CMMI (CMU/SEI-2000-TR-018), there is erroneous duplication. E.g., "Commitment" in PMC reads exactly like "Commitment" in Requirements Management PA (it shouldn't !). Ditto for Co in SAM, Co in MA, and the subsequent Maturity Level 2 Process Area commitments. The same erroneous cut-and-paste was made for the Abilities, DI, etc. The Level 3 PAs have the similar problem, erroneous cut-and-pastes from the RD template. I cannot use this book as I'd intended because of these errors, so I have to lug around the large heavy SEI tech reports instead 
 The cover is great. For a second, you'd think this was finally the definitive guide to Michael Moore's life. Something that documents his struggles and embellishments. Alas, this book is another failed attempt to make a buck.  First, anyone passing by the book and checks it out will notice the font. It is a large, child sized font. Basically, about 100 words average each page. Roughly, it's size is actually a quarter of the length you'd expect it to be.  Then there's the content. Take the chapter on "The Awful Truth". I was a big fan of the show and I expected that the chapter would actually be about how Michael Moore stuggled to make the show with a small budget, getting the show off the ground, and dealing with the lower ratings than "TV Nation". Almost an entire HALF A PAGE is dedicated to all that information! The truth is: the chapter deals with little else than a disgruntled part-time intern/fact-checker getting fired so the show could save more money. I do not care about this part time employee. Especially when it turns out that he stalks Moore. The book tries to set Mike up for being the bad guy for taking legal actions about said ex-employee. Despite the attempts, the fact that Moore receives death threats everyday and does not have secret service to protect him, makes his paranoia reasonable. The ex-employee also comes off as a jerk in the prose, which shows how the propaganda of the novel fails considerably.  Expect every chapter to be vaguely written with little to no details about what is actually interesting in Moore's life. The book takes about a hour or two to read (pretty much, you could read it in Borders and save some money).  What I will say is the best thing about the book are the pictures of a young (and thin) Michael Moore. It's interesting to know that he was once a normal guy. He may be rich now, but he wasn't born that way. I think that is a much better book, but apparently Schultz disagrees with me. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions 
 The film Why We Fight, I believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize America. I felt that the movie, only told one side of the argument, and that side was clearly not pro-America. The film portrays the United States as a power hungry nation, which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world. The film constantly criticizes the decisions of America leaders to engage into foreign combat. The film however, does not present an alternative solution. It fails to take into consideration that America may be acting out of self defense. The film constantly criticizes America for engaging in combat throughout the world. What I have to say to the director of this film is: Is it not alright to defend your nation, after terrorist drive planes into two buildings, killing 3,000 people? Is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots, who are looking to destroy your way of life? Is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the Middle East, by toppling a murderous dictator? When I see these questions, I have to answer no to all of them. I feel that if America feels threatened, it should not have to seek permission to defend itself. President Bush put it properly I feel when he stated "After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers," and "America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people." This film can criticize America and label it as a bully nation, but these terrorist must be brought to justice. President Eisenhower once said, "Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin." As the most powerful nation in the world, it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world. It is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as Americans, sometimes take for granted. Since when, has it become wrong to defend your nation. Why must America be criticized for engaging in conflict, when it feels threatened? Is it not the job of the President of the United States to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent? Does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack America again, if they are given the chance? We can never let our guard down. Freedom does not come free. On September 11, 2001 we saw firsthand how evil, those who want to destroy us can be. You can not negotiate with these types of people. The only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force. On the morning of the September 11, 2001 attacks, President Bush stated that "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended." Indeed freedom was and is being defended, and I see nothing wrong with that. Words are not enough to protect our nation. President Theodore Roosevelt said, "Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all mankind," and our great action, will be to defend this great nation. In the words of President Hoover, "Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity," and it is America's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom. Remember: "Words without actions are the assassins of idealism." Herbert Hoove 
 This isn't a kick a** book like I was hoping.  It isn't a celebration of the single state; it seems more the the author was regretfully resigned to this delightful condition.  Some of the adivce runs like "bla bla until you can find a man" or "it's not your fault you are single, you've tried long and hard to find a man".  As if we were waiting with baited breath for prince charming.  I guess it's okay for the needy types 
 The companion web site mentioned in the book is not there. When I typed in that URL, I got redirected to Peachpit's advertising site of this book, but no "links", "tools", nor "examples" mentioned in the book at all! 
 I had this one figured out by the second chapter. Too predictable and shallow. Hopefully, the next Stone book will actually be worth reading 
 So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not 
 This book's information is generally accurate, and it's easy to read.  However, readers should know that the American Academy of Pediatrics sold this book a formula company. Now, the company gives hundreds of thousands of copies of it emblazoned with their logo to pediatricians offices to give away for free.  If the American Academy of Pediatrics really cares about breastfeeding and the well-being of breastfeeding mothers and babies, why would they sell their book to a formula company?  Perhaps the answer is because the American Academy of Pediatrics depends nearly 100% on the pharmaceutical and formula industries for its financial support.  There are many excellent books on breastfeeding:  Newman and Pittman's The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers; Mohrbacher's Breastfeeding Made Simple; Sears and Sears' The Breastfeeding Book, to name but a few. Buying one of them will not support the American Academy of Pediatrics, and in turn, the formula industry.    
 This book, although cleverly written and beautifully illustrated, is one my kids turn away from routinely!  "Harriet" gets in trouble in a new way on every page!  While this is an accurate representation of many childhood days, I don't think kids want to read about it.  Getting in trouble happens enough in real life 
 I am a Martina fan, but don't care for this cd.  I agree with the other reviewers who think this album has an over-produced sound.  Timeless was great and "A Broken Wing" has to be one of my all-time favorite songs, but this album missed the marked.  Even "Anyway" which is probably the best song on the cd doesn't quite measure up to some of her past hits.  If you are a new Martina fan try out an earlier album.  
 This was my introduction to Terry Pratchett's writing.  Reading all of the reviews led me to believe that this book was a funny take on the world of cats.  This book, which reads like an essay of observations, is not ground breaking and is certainly not hilarious.  If I were counting I would say that there might have been ten chuckles all together.  Certainly not as funny as it was cracked up to be. The treatment felt superficial and the observations felt recycled from other writings about cats.  Nothing here would recommend this book over any other cat book or story that I have read 
 When I read this book, I was fascinated by the story of Cook's life (who wouldn't be?) but I was sure this book was a reprint of some turn of the 19th/20th century author. But no, it was published in 1995. So where does this guy get that Australian aborigines are negrotoid and Inuits are mongoloid? Has he read any recent anthropology? Does he still believe in phrenology? He seems not to have read anything besides Beaglehole's biography and Beaglehole's editions of the journals, except for a few other journals by the crew. There is no historiography and no analysis. This book was originally a manuscript Hough found in a Victorian attic, I am sure of it! 
 Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite.  Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con.  A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus.  There are two principle types of literay work:  1. That which is to be read. and of course  2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face.  Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category.  You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work:  Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow.  You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!!  What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity 
 Well put together and had a lot of great photos 
 Most of the reviews as far as I can tell are for the actual paper version of the book, but I just wanted to comment on the audio verson.  It's bad as you can tell from the title of my review.  The reader is slow and makes the story drag on and drag.  Despite that, I managed to get through 15 hours of agony because I spent so much buying this audio CD.  Again, the story moves very slow in the audio CD version 
 When I heard that Laura Powers was simular to Loreena Mckennit I rushed to get this cd.  I was very disappointed. Laura Powers Has a lovely voice and the songs are good, but she can't compare with Loreena Mckennit and Enya.  She lacks Enya and Loreena's surrealistic sound and Loreena's incredable instrumentation. When you Listen to Enya you feel like you have passed part way into the otherworld. When you listen to Loreena you feel like you have stepped back into the ancient world of mystics, Shamens and exotic lands.  Laura, although her music is soothing, provides no enchantment. Overall I would not recommend this Cd to anyone 
 Date on bottom of can shows an expiration of June 2007. I would expect a longer shelf life.Also the label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat. This generally equates to bone fragments. I'm not confident with this product 
 This film is AWFUL! Once again Hollywood misuses the amazing talents of that "MOST BEAUTIFUL and SENSUAL" of actresses,GINA GERSHON.LOVED GINA but HATED the film/THe two-star rating was for GINA,she is ALWAYS GREAT 
 I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks.  In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider 
 This book while well written contains too much stuff that Windows2000  Professional shares with WindowsNT.  It is not a good reference book.   Perhaps it would be better off positioned as an introductory text because  it has too much fluff 
 My problem with this book lies not with the writing, but with the printing:  missing fifty pages, the book repeats the first quarto.  Happily, the publisher graciously sent me a new copy, but prospective readers should be forwarned 
 This book covers the basics well, but does not cover any concept in depth. This book might be good for undergrad class for introduction class, but not a good one for grad level and one interested in advanced topics in VLSI. 
 Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead 
 I was looking forward to reading this but was not able to finish the book. There is no hint of objectivity in this work. The sole purpose seems to be to praise blacks. Toward that end the book is a stream of quotes that have only one thing in common--they say something positive about blacks. There is little attempt to analyze or coordinate these quotes. Quotes will be taken from authors who disagree with many of Jackson's theories but that doesn't bother him as long as the quote meets his immediate needs. It appears that he'll use any quote from any source without attempt at analysis if it meets his limited objectives.  Jackson inserts his own unexamined opinions often without any attempt at analysis. Any work based solely an attempt to promote one race is doomed to failure and this is no exception 
 This film is an adaptation of the first book in the new Frankenstein series by Dean Koontz. I am not really a Dean Koontz fan and have only read a few of his books, but the first 2 in this series were excellent. (I eagerly await the 3rd, which is past due to come out.) This movie was a very boring, poor adaptation in my opinion. Why Dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books I cannot understand. Every movie version of his books has been really bad, this one is no exception. It is dull, which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull. It is no wonder that Dean took his name off this project. That should have been sufficient warning to me. If I could get my money back, I would. Save yours, or better yet, buy the Frankenstein books to enjoy the real story 
 This book for me has two faces, for some time, I enjoyed it like a drug, and then it was difficult for me to even open it... The thing is, for me, when Strieber tells his story, it's like the best book I've ever read, but when he pretends to be some scientist or else, and he tries to look so objectif, it just gets pathetic, unbearable...  However, I think people should read the book, but really skip some parts because some have just no sense.. 
 If you're looking for the new millennium's sequel to Feminine Mystique or Backlash, keep looking.   Warner spends almost 300 pages trying to figure out whether she's trying to evaluate the mothering cultures of France and the U.S. (when she was in France, she found it far inferior to the U.S.; now that she's back in the States, it's clear that France is superior), resolve the mommy wars (she deftly handles this by arguing that most money-earning moms don't work full time and most SAHMs have some kind of paid work, thereby eliminating the divide), determine the merits of nursery school vs an overly scheduled childhood vs just hanging out, or trace the ups and downs of mothering theory as compared and constrasted to the rise and fall of feminism.   Whew, that's a lot!  No wonder she encapsulates the above (and more) as "This Mess."    Because the general topic is near to my heart, and because I know so many women similar to Warner and her interviewees (heavily pedigreed mothers of the post baby boom generation, which Warner oddly defines as beginning in 1958), I picked up this book expecting to find some really good tidbits if not a wholly coherent structure that pulled all the pieces of motherhood together.  Instead I found...a mess.  My theory is that Warner started off with the best intentions, sure there was a book in all this material somewhere, and hoping that the thesis would shape itself if she collected enough data from enough women (she interviewed 150 moms).  That didn't happen, and she didn't even get any good anecdotes out of the experience.     My own observation, as a mother of four who span the range from college to third grade, is that a lot of the sources she cites (the seminal treatises of each decade that redefined the role of mothers and the relationship of moms to paid work) didn't have nearly as much impact as she wants to believe.  Being a mom has always entailed a significant amount of soul searching, juggling, angst, self-abnegation, and doubt.  But everyone, mom or not, is affected by the increasing complexities of day-to-day life and the ongoing pressure to succeed, do more, spend more, experience more. We are all dealing with more stress, and Warner fails to factor that into her analysis.  (She also somehow forgets to mention that there's a lot of joy to be derived from raising kids, and that there are plenty of parents and kids who are thoroughly enjoying the whole family thing, stresses notwithstanding.)   Warner's only hope of being extricated from This Mess, stated in her concluding sentence, is that society will "come together to make it a reality."  That's not going to happen, and blaming the Mommy Mystique is ultimately a pretty pathetic excuse for not taking charge of your own life.  No need to wallow in This Mess 
 This story starts out immersing the reader in a Klingon battle game, the rules of which are never clear. This opening only really serves to introduce the main characters of the book and is otherwise confusing and completely unnecessary. I almost put the book down because this section was so uninteresting. But it does pick up somewhat from there, when we follow Vrenn's life and his rise from humble beginnings to command a ship of his own. There are some interesting dynamics between the characters but as usual when dealing with Klingons, you're never quite sure who can be trusted or who will ultimately betray whom.  Nearly every bit of Klingon lore and culture introduced in this book has been contradicted by the "official" canon of later TV shows and movies, so it's not even really good as a peek in the Klingon way of life. Bottom line - unless you are passionately interested in all things Klingon, I would pass this book by 
 this film had a few laughs but it never really got working for me.James Belushi always seems to get the sidekick role even in films where He is the Main star.it is a very cliched type of film but it has some moments 
 This is a serious book on psychology,  not one of those "how to" popular books. To me it was very helpful, it helps to understand oneself better. I reccomend it warmly 
 Oh there definitley is a balance with the chemistry that is going on in this album. It is the chemistry of a WHOLE box of exlax mixing with my digestive system and the aftermath that arrives in my toilet. This is what occurs when I listen to the lyrics of the ying yang twins. The beats are hot, don't get me wrong. But a song is incomplete when it doesn't have any good lyrics to go with that beat. So that makes an album of incomplete songs because every bar that dribbles off the crusty lips of the ying wack twins are no better than a bar my son can spit. Buy an instrumental of this album and avoid making your eardrums hurt by hearing the lyrics 
 You can't write a mystery without a solution and call it "pulp" or "noir" in my book.  Those of you who are fans of King's writing will find this readable, but hardly enjoyable.  Those who are not would do well to stay away.  We're halfway through the book before we're even introduced to the "mystery", and we're finished the book before we're told that there's no solution to it.   And worst of all, none of this seems to bother the Downeast characters narrating the tale 
 i had to rate this book one star because there was no "ZERO"!  This book is complete garbage and the worst investment you can make to start your investment career.  There are other books on investing in this series, which do an incredible job for beginners.  Even the resource centers at any decent online broker has better information for you than this book has and the links won't go bad 
 Just not a good book.  Not very well written.  No real insight, lessons learned, etc.  Just not worth reading 
 I picked this book up from the library (thank goodness no money out of my pocket) because I thought it was a mystery. Talk about hiding the real genre of the book! NO WHERE does it say this book is Sci-Fi. I got about 40 pages in and threw it against the wall. It wasn't sufficiently interesting to persue and I really do not like Sci-Fi. Why didn't the publisher advertise it as such? Trying to sneak this stinker out? Yuck - now that I know what Reilly TRIES to write (he's a terrible writer) I won't bother picking up another of his "books." Kind of make you wonder who he knows in the publishing world to get this crap into print 
 Sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.I'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.Nothing is moving,action is zero and filming is poor. we are very far away from dirty dozen,battle of the bulge,midway,enemy below etc.... a total waste of time and money 
 There is frankly no 'truth' to be found in this publication.  Aside from the previously circulated speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's political aspirations and orentation, her knowledge of and duplicity inside the Lewinsky affair, and her march to the Senate, this work is void of anything but base conjecture and one-sided analyses which offer no depth and villify the women's movement in 21st century America at large.  I had the double misfortune of perusing this volume via CD.  The material is made far less credible by Mr. Klein's own wheezy and wet-sounding reading of his work.  I address this first because I am part of a large number of technoservants who spend 8-10 hours per day with no diversions during a monotonous coding job but for headphones, and I want explicitly to warn any readers from the audio version of this work.  It begins with an inane and unintentionally ridiculous buzzing sound from somewhere at the top of Klein's palate and carries on with sardonic emphasis placed on repeated terms such as:  'lesbianism', 'leftist' and 'aspiration'.  Spaced at roughly equal intervals (making one further question the very validity of research), Klein gleefully quotes Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, their aides and supporters, and the altogether too-rare addition of Clinton apoligists in making vulgar statements.  A professional narrator understands the proper treatment of the profanity that occurs (and is only attributed to the Clinton camp) in situations such as this, and Klein clearly does not.  Klein's very decision to narrate his own narrative is a poor one, and further displays the partisanship that he clearly wishes to convey with every written word of it.  As to the substance, and contrary to the title, there are no revelations about Mrs. Clinton contained anywhere within this narrative.  And I sincerely mean that - Klein has acheived no investigative credibility in simply regurgitating what is already known about the Senator.  The speculations regarding her sexuality (or, as Klein would argue, her very lack thereof), her role in Mr. Clinton's sexual escapades and the Lewinsky affair, and the politicking that took place in New York are either matters of public record or outright conjecture that would make Kenneth Starr look like a law-and-order hawk.    With reference to what the title leads the casual browser to believe is the centerstone of the book (what she knew about the Lewinsky affair), Klein does nothing but recirculate rumors and ideas that any half-informed person has already heard:  that Hillary knew about Bill's affair with Monica, that she did nothing to stop it, and even that she was reponsible (!!!) for it because it was her connections that lead to Lewinsky's entrance to the White House.  There is a contradictory juxtaposition here - Klein leads the reader on into this affair shortly after explaining that a young Hillary Rodham launched a verbal tirade against harrassment of interns while an intern herself.  Klein mistakenly presumes that everyone will nod at his faulty logic (that Hillary became the enabler of a concept she defames), yet it actually illustrates that Hillary is what she claims to be:  her own woman, independent of Bill himself.  As a disclaimer, I do not support Hillary Clinton.  I believe that she is a disengenuous person, willing to sacrifice her own rather confrontational ideas in favor of pursuit of public office.  But Klein makes this argument foolish.  His barely disguised anymosity for the Democratic party at large and his not-at-all disguised disdain for feminism which borders on outright sexism within this very narrative (he frequently charactarizes Hillary's crowd as a group of butch supporters of what HE has dubbed 'lesbianism') is nothing short of inane.  This narrative is poorly organized, and the silly quips with which he ends each of the far too numerous 'chapters' are representative of, well, nothing at all.  Possibly the saddest commentary I can offer is that this narrative is wrought with inconsitency on both an intellectual and factual level (as Klein altogether too often relies on sources who 'jumped ship' from the Clinton camp and he treats his conjecture as actual evidence, often citing 'facts' that are no more than his own speculation of Hillary's mindset), and has no organization to fall back on except the aforementioned large number of 'chapters'.  This work just rambles on and on while saying, well, nothing.  Finally, readers may chuckle to see that Klein has printed a number of glaring grammatical errors:  at one point he says that Hillary wore contact lenses that make her eyes 'bluer'.  In summation, this work needs to carry the disclaimer:  "Paid for by the Republican National Commitee" in exactly the same way the Michael Moore's "Faranheit:  911" needed a discalimer for the Democratic party.  That way the casual browser or, in my case, the frankly interested citizen preparing to make voting decisions for the 2008 primaries would just keep browsing.  There is nothing in Klein's work that suggests any effort on his part to search for the 'truth' he erroneously claims to offer; only the 'cut-and-paste' [... 
 If you know the physiology, and want to review, get a little deeper, then OK, BUT COME ON. Have the other reviewers used this book to learn physiology from. The writing is horrible, the book needs an editor. Perhaps the writers should have taken some more writing classes, and less physiology when they were in college.   Don't use this book to learn physiology! It just bombards you with facts (like I said, a reference manual) but is horrible at explaining concepts, so then you just sort of memorize, memorize for exams, and a month later you can't remember anything, because it's such a mess in your head.   
 Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass 
 I give this album one star solely because the CD side WILL NOT play in a computer!  I love the content of the album; it's one of my favorites.  The remixes are all pretty good, from listening to the album in a CD player or as a DVD.  I'm not sure if it's some sort of copy protection that prevents play in a computer, or poor manufacturing techniques, but either way the producer of the album should be ashamed 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 This was like a kid's first reader for adults.  Only about 20 pages, and definately not worth more than a dollar or two. It should be marked more clearly that it's not really a "book". I was very disappointed 
 This is a terrible book.  Having read many of Dumas' other books, I expected a story about a dashing young hero who would fight with the blood thirsty rabble in Paris to rescue the innocent victims of the revolution.  Instead, I found an aimless and unbelievable plot that proceeded to kill off all the heros and heroines in the book.  I was left totally perplexed about why Dumas bothered to write this awful book 
 I can not belive how a band as lame as this can actually get signed to a label. They make Limp Bizkit look like Led Zeppelin and I hate Limp Bizkit! I made the mistake of seeing them on Craig Kilborn the other night and believe it or not, they're even worse live than in the studio. Whne I hear something like this being actually called music, I almost want to ram ice picks into my eardrums so I won't have to hear it. If car company put out cars with the same quality standards as some of today's band's so-called music, we'd all be walking or dead. This sounds like someone yelling and screaming while pushing a lawnmower. As another reviewer said, If I could give this negative stars, I would. Avoid this at all cost!! 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 I've read Wicked first and perhaps that was where the mistake lies. Wicked was so well written that after reading such a great novel, Confessions was somewhat of a disappointment. It's not a bad novel but the character development was just par and the storyline seemed a bit forced. I would love to recommend Wicked though for those who might be interested. I even bought the soundtrack from the Broadway show 
 This is a book your boring granddaddy might have written. That it was (allegedly) written by the monumentally talented James A. Michener is hard to believe. It was written relatively late in his life, and he was losing it 
 Don't waste your time and money on this piece of excrement.  Ms. Homes HATES L.A. and lets the reader know it all the time.  She knows nothing of the history of Chateau Marmont.  She also has an ego so huge it wouldn't fit into Arrowhead Pond. No dear, it's not REALLY a pond!  The writer refers to herself more than once as an "intellectual from the East." Usually when someone speaks so highly of themselves it's frequently because no one else does.  Ms. Homes is like the one irritating girl in class that knows EVERYTHING and lets you know she knows everything all the time. If you want to read a truly splendid book about the Chateau Marmont pick up "Life at the Marmont" and don't waste any time and money on this one.  My copy will be on the garbage truck in the morning. If I could have chosen NO STARS I would. A.M. Homes you are a disgrace 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 I got this book and the Adobe User's Guide when I purchased Adobe Audition 1.5.  This book requires that you have a pretty good idea of what is going on in recording and gives hardly any examples of practical applications for how you can use the program. It is simply the type of book that says, if you want to do this, here are the steps to accomplish that feat.  The Adobe user's guide isn't much better.    
 Being an art history major and having read numerous books on 17th and 18th art, I found Minor's work to be one of the least helpful or accessible.  He arranges his text by subjects instead of chronologically or by artist or by country.  Though an interesting approach, it makes it difficult to follow the development of the arts through the centuries.  Anyone really interested in Baroque art and culture should look instead to Julius Held and Donald Posner's classic text 
 This devotional is shallow and uninspiring. The only thing I learned from it is this woman should stop writing books and spend more time focusing on her home life. 
 I will keep this brief.  This is Peter David's worst New Frontier book.  I recommend it only if you are an avid New Frontier fan. The plotting is poor, the dialogue stilted.  Shelby's handling of her crew was terribly portrayed.  The resolution of the Lefler plot from the previous book was out of place. Calhouns tale on the planet read like a poorly done western. There is so much about this book that needed improving I am leaving it to other reviewers to say. The book seemed as though it needed a re-write 
 Ok, so I'm a half hour into the movie, and I'm falling asleep here on my couch. I rented "The Return" as part of a usual Saturday horror-film fest. The PG-13 rating was the first thing that caught my attention...however, there have been a few good PG 13 horror films, at least in my opinion (What Lies Beneath, The Ring), but they are somewhat of a rarity. I guess I should have figured that this one staring Sarah Michelle Gellar probably wouldn't stand the test of taste. So what's missing?  A good horror film is like a good speech, book, article....what not. You have an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Well, we start off with an introduction. It was good, nice set-up, good acting, great environment. However, the introduction never seems to end. When you're 45 minutes into the film and so far all you've seen were a few flashy images, loud smash cuts, and eerie music, as the main character walks around in circles, it's just time to start something new. The scariest part had to be when I ran out of ice cream! In element we've gone from horror film to drama, with little to no plot advancement. Then we start a romance which seems way out of character to me for a career obsessed traveling sales-woman. If anything, this movie is more of a drama about strange stalkers who all seem to specifically go after Sarah (well, she is hott...).   Reality: The film seems pretty real, all except for one spot where she reaches for a knife on the stairs after being cornered, yet she caries a switchblade in her boot...what?? Yet the rest of the film seems to be pretty realistic and the characters act somewhat reasonable.   Plot: Ok, so it's not very intriguing. The story is a drama, not a horror film. Don't expect to be scared, but you'll probably jump at a few of the smash-cuts. Most of the plot carries Sarah around as she tries to figure out her past and why she's connected to this small Texas town. The creators gave a bit too much away too early and you figure most everything out before the third act. Nothing new, nothing interesting....it's just as it is. There's an interesting final twist at the end, but that's going to just about cover it. The final scene is just a simple fade to black. Everything comes together, and all is as it should be in the world.   Effects: Yeah, um...virtually, there are no effects. So if you're looking for monsters, blood, gore, that sort of thing, don't rent this guy. There are a few vehicle wrecks which were pretty exciting, but that's about all the icing on this cake...  Film elements; Acting, camera, lighting, sound, music....the rest is all about what you'd expect from a common drama. It's all placed together pretty well in a nice coherent manner. It's definitely a budgeted film, and lives up to hollywood standards by all means. Definitely technically sounds. A slight desaturated color scheme spills over the film's "style," and some strange quick zoom in, blur, quick zoom out type camera work adds to it. I'm not sure I particularly enjoyed this, but it's something I haven't seen to often.  All-in-all, it's you average film, nothing new, nothing exciting, but it should please the drama or thriller fans. It's definitely no horror film and will provide little excitement to the die-hard horror fan. I might rent this on a rainy day with my girlfriend, but I wouldn't add it to my collection.  
 terrible! dialog non existent. Need to run this with subtitle on to  make a feeble attempt to hear the actors 
 This film tells the story of a great battle where a group of village of Thai villages held off a major army from Burma history. The story itself, I found well explained. I found the story line appeared to be weak. The acting I thought was poor. The action was okay.   If you are going to do a movie like this, I think you need to spend more money then what people did on this movie 
 This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book 
 The Church hasn't changed -- we still despise the things and pleasures of this world in favor of charity and sacrifice. Everything passes away, except charity, which endures in eternity. Kaiser, in contrast, whistles up a notional church in which everyone is free to follow their own desires -- oh, I mean conscience. In Newchurch, conscience means carnality. This is how nations fall, folks. Follow your bliss and blow off your neighbor.   
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 Unable to get a message to Amazon any other way.  The last two cds are bad, can't play them on my cd player.  I have sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure, but no one has contacted me.  Very disappointed in the Customer relations of this cd compan 
 I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray.  This was terrible.  Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous.  I'm sorry Ray, I love you.  It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's 
 This is a good example of rap today.  You don't need to be a MC to land a deal, or even know how to rhyme.  All you need to do is come up with a dance move, make songs about your damn clothes and how you party all the time and your on.  This ain't right man... it just ain't right !! 
 This book is RIDDLED with typos and factual errors! The very first paragraph in the book refers to something that was 'sited' on the cover (they meant 'cited'). The very popular camera manufacturer Canon was spelled 'Cannon'! I could go on and on--but that's the book editor's job--not mine!  My question is: who edited this book? How could a book with literally hundreds of errors--factual and grammatical--make it through your publication pipeline? How did the weak sentence construction and freshman-English-class mistakes pass by an editor's cursor 
 I found the book another rehash of the same theme: customers aren't all the same, so you can't just push advertising at them anymore. Okay, okay, we know that already.   The authors seem enamored with complex and unnecessary terminology, which I found tedious. the book is full of terms like "persuasion architecture," "business topology," "modalities," and "personas," to name a few. I guess the more jargon you can use, the more you can charge. If that is what you are looking for, then it's a great book.  Remember geometry class and all those tedious proofs you had to go through, step by step. I could intuit the answers so had little patience for proofs. That's what this book reminded me of. In all it seemed to me to be an overly complex paint-by-numbers approach. Even so, it just *approaches* the subject but never really gets there. You can identify all the modalities and develop all the personas you want, but without the creavity to turn that information into compelling marketing, it doesn't help anything except the consultants' bottom lines.   I kept expecting the "real meat" of the book to come, but it never did for me. Perhaps it's because I'm already knowledgeable on the subject. With such a clever title, I hoped there might be some nuggets, but I found none. Some good ways to explain some issues to clients, but that's about it.   
 I have the feeling that Mr. Luciano was running out of ideas with this book.  The only reason to read this book is for the inside accounts from the average players that the author enlists to fill out this book. This book is okay, if you are looking for a quick, light read 
 I am an avid fan of the chipmunks. I was there when they first came out. I have the original 45's of The Witch Doctor, The Bird Sitting On My head which are really not the Chipmunks, but I have Alvins Harmonica and The christmas Song and Ragtime Cowboy Joe. I was disappointed when I listened to the first few songs on this album. They aren't the original recordings. I think that should be mentioned. I do have the Greatest HIts of the Chipmunks which are the originals, but they put only 10 or 11 songs on the cd and non of the David Seville songs. I know the original recordings are on Liberty records. I'm not sure if they are still around, but someone must have the original tapes. Lets get the original recordings on cd and not just 10 songs. I would definately get the Grestest hits with the 10 songs. At least they are the originals 
 This book is boring.  I loved the first two books in this series; Hannah was an engaging heroine and her method of solving the crimes with her family and friends came as a welcome change after dozens of detective loners.  The two books prior to this one were not particularly good, but I'd hoped that was because they were rushed and that a return to a once-a-year publication rate would mean a return to the type of book I'd so enjoyed.  Not so.  Like the last two, this book is crammed with irrelevant minutia that does nothing to advance the plot and little to develop character.  For example, within the first few pages, I learned that Hannah puts a single cube of frozen coffee into her hot coffee because ice would dilute the caffeine, watched with her while her cat stretched--each stage described in loving detail, and learned about her preferred shower temperature. Later, all sorts of random facts are shoved in and detailed, again, with no purpose.  To make matters worse, Hannah has still to choose whom to marry and does not make up her mind by the end of the book.  In fact, she dates someone else and feels smug about "shaking up" Mike and Norm's world by doing so.    I'm off to try some other series by some other author 
 This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame 
 Cooper's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text --- from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager, of a real company. It contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories --- along with trite sayings such as "When you find a back door that's open, close it" or my personal favorite "Use the lanterns of your life to help light the way." If you're looking for an inspirational book, one with a solid basis, forget this one. You'd be better off reading the daily horoscope 
 Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I couldn't get excited about any of the characters.  I didn't even finish it.  Gave it to the local library.  I'm a quilter myself, and enjoy reading Underground Railroad stories, so you'd think this would have been right up my alley, but it just wasn't.  Not that there was anything wrong with it exactly...it just wasn't my cup of tea.  
 sublime is an all around good band with great soul and inspirations, but this album is more like a sign of what was to come for the boys. sadly, i think they would have been way too alternative mainstream if brad would have lived...alongside bands like red hot chili peppers and 311 for eternity...my advice is to stick with Iron Maiden. very random of a recommendation, but youll be surprsied how some bands just fall apart compared to others...but if you really want some reggae So-Cal punk, get 40 oz to freedom and Robbin the Hood 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 My husband bought this book and its companion, If He Only Knew, since we need to work on strengthening our marriange.  I was glad that he took the initiative and was eager to read the book, but I found myself a bit disappointed by the content.  While the basic concepts seem good, I found the examples and suggestions to be rather outdated.  It was originally published in 1979, and, despite some revisions, seems to belong to a different time -- that of 25 years ago.  The book seems to lean too much toward the idea of the wife being submissive to her husband, and encourages her to look nice and greet him with a smile when he comes home from work, which sounds very much like the Home Economics textbooks from the 1950s.  I feel that the author's suggestions do not really speak to me in today's world 
 Harsh words, yes!  "Into the Garden......." was disappointing and quite a bit "out there". Way too new age. If you want a free copy just send me a SASE 
 Good book giving the details on all the CS 2's new features. Two thumbs up 
 I saw this movie on Fearnet.  Thank God it was free and I didn't rent, buy, or borrow.  This is yet again another ripoff suckfest that can't hold it's weight of steamy doo-doo.  I hate this movie.  I hope the people involved in its unholy creation have their film van broken into and all their stuff gets stolen and sold on Ebay.  And I would buy all that jacked stuff just to smash it in the street.  Ugh.  I feel faint.. 
 I bought this book because it was reviewed well.  I have no idea who liked it, or whom it is for.  It's definitely not an investor's book, despite the title.  It's more of a theoretical diatribe by the authors against Graham and Dodd -- read that instead.  It claims to be the updated version.  The preface mentions Enron, but everything else is from the 60s and 70s.  Examples talk about oil at $5 per barrel.  Overall, it's a disappointment, with very little that's useful or interesting 
 This book states that it's better to die than survive a rape:  "Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle." (p.196)  How much more twisted can it get?  
 This doesn't sound like YLT at all. If you like a bunch of slow, acoustic, sad songs this is an album for you.  Maybe it's the fact that this record is a good attempt to pay tribute to some unknown bands that it gets a couple of stars...I honestly, don't get it. 
 Has anyone looking at this book noticed that for the Cancer sign, which, to the best of my knowledge its symbol is a CRAB, that in the book it's a  LOBSTER!   I mean, come on!  Who edited this book?  That just threw me  right off. Maybe it is just the St.Martins Press copy I picked up?  Don't  know. But it certainly hasn't leant any credibility. If this author was  alive today, I am sure she would be livid. Very silly 
 This book is useful and contains a lot of good information, but could have been half as thick as it is. Everything is summarized more than once, in side-bars and at the ends of chapters, and key points are even repeated more than once in the text itself. The result is patchy text that is difficult to navigate and next to impossible to find information quickly in 
 This book was recommended by our baby's pediatrician. Its really a "cry it out" book. So it depends on if that's a method you're willing to inflict on your child. We're looking for a new pediatrician 
 Yes, I have read portions of the book-- I couldn't stomach most of it.  It saddens me that Focus on the Family and MOPs promotes Ms. Whelchel as an author and speaker on parenting.  Many of the suggestions she have are in no way helpful to children in helping them to learn, and cannot even be called discipline which means "to teach" not "to arbitrarily punish."  For the record, I am a conservative Christian, not a liberal or seeking to rid God from anyone's lives.  I seek to raise my children according to the way God treats us all as sinners-- forgiveness and love and compassion.  Thankfully when I screw up (as we all do as both children and adults), God doesn't pour hot-sauce down my throat, drag me by the hair across a parking lot, hit me, or any other method along those lines.  He welcomes me back with forgiveness and uses the situation to help teach me what I did wrong and how I can try and not sin in that manner in the future.  For "John St Meyers" from Indy, you can't even quote the bible correctly-- the bible in no manner EVER says "Spare the rod, spoil the child", that is a widely misquoted & misused quote from a SONG in the 70s.  I would more strongly recommend books such as "Grace-Based Parenting" by Tim Kimmel, "Biblical Parenting" by Crystal Lutton, and "How to Talk so Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk" by Adele Faber 
 All I can say is that if and when this novel is made into a movie, expect a lot of changes. A screenwriter will certainly not go with such a slow, dragging pace. Also, there will need to be many more actual confrontations with Dracula, not just infinitesimal accretions of knowledge boringly gained through research about the vampire. There will need to be more horryfing scenes and far less looking through dry manuscripts. And that pretty much sums up my objections to the book 
 This is a strange little book.  The intention is good, love conquers all, dealing with aging, etc...  However,it is full of negative images, and frankly is...creepy.  When the boy is awake, he is exasperating, annoying, foul mouthed, and strange.  The only time the mother shows her love is by furtively entering her son's room and singing her little love ditty.  For what it's worth, my wife hates it too and refers to it as "The stalking story."  It has been unceremoniously pitched out of our house.  If you want a better rendition of this sort of thing, try The Runaway Bunny, or Guess How Much I Love You 
 Am i the only real music left on this planet that thinks, no knows, that Janet CANNOT sing.  Don't get me wrong, very nice body, nice dancing, but her voice is garbage.  For that matter none of the Jacksons can sing, stop playing, keep it real 
 While Guy Grand's pranks are amusing, the book lacks any real satirical center or dramatic structure, which would give it some meaning (and some real bite).  You could take the chapters out of their present sequence, reassemble them in any order, and the book would be just as effective --- and that's about as damning a criticism as I can think of.  The book utlimately is a washout.  It starts and stops in the same place, and in between the narrative just meanders from episode to episode without any real idea of what it wants to do, or how to do it.  Not Southern's best, by any means, but better than tripe like CANDY 
 I am embarrased that someone is looking at this page and considering reading the cliffnotes for one the the best (and not to mention shortest) pieces of american literature.  Try to use your brains for something other than reality television and choosing a fast food joint.  Its not all that hard to read this book and understand it.  ENJOY 
 I don't really want 2 pages of every four dedicated to where I sat, what I ate, and "place ticket stub here" type of things.  I just wanted a book to score games in...I got half of what I paid for.  If you want a book to score games in and you are under 10 years old, then this book is fine.  If you are an adult and want to score games, get something else 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 These days, young (and not-so-young) children are subjected to such books with the intention of 'expanding their historical understanding, giving them a politically sensitive persepctive, and allowing for an introduction to what they cannot yet handle--real literature'. I have read this book; many teachers have their students read this book; it is a shame.  If your idea of good children's literature is this, then you'll probably enjoy such fine works as 'What Jamie Saw' and 'Gentlehands', the latter of which is a modern defense of a monsterous SS officer. And, also, if you enjoy this sort of work, do the world a favor and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home, preferably hidden in the closet, never to return to the real world again. So, if you're a teacher reading this review, don't force your students to read this and other drivel. Try Huck Finn... I'm fairly confident that most of you have heard of Mark Twain. Or, better yet, 'The Loved One' by Evelyn Waugh. Remember, it's never too late to teach your kids that subjects such as death and perversion can be--and are-- hillarious.  If you're a kid reading this, wondering if it's a good novel (I'm using the word novel loosely here), it isn't. This is the story of a little factory girl who pouts a lot about her existence but "keeps on truckin'" as they say, and in the end is about as enjoyable and empowering as, say, a dishwasher commercial. Read above for good books to read... they've got swear words and dirty humor, and are much more entertaining and informative than this trash. No, go pick up 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Your parents'll love that one. If you're an adult wondering if you should read this, I have nothing to say to you. You are beyond all hope and redemption 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 The Kite Rider. A book centered completely on the importance of obedience. A small boy living in a small village of 13th century china has to overcome everything that is taught to him and above all from the importance of obedience to the importance of respect for your elders. Through being strapped to a kite and being used as a wind tester for a merchant vessel, Haoyou's father, Gou Pei, is brutally killed by first mate Di Chou, and that sets Haoyou's life in for a whirlwind of events he could not have imagined possible. After the horrific loss to Haoyou's family, Di Chou even tries so marry his mother -Qing An- an ambition he has long had. When Haoyou's greedy, gambling addicted uncle agrees immediately, Haoyou and his cousin Mipeng know they must do something. They send Di Chou (completely drunk) on a vessel, but to do that Haoyou bribes the seamen by being a wind tester. This brings The Great Miao, circus master of the Jade Circus looking for Haoyou to be one of his acts. Once again, Great Uncle Bo agrees for the money that he knows he can make out of it. Haoyou's kite riding act does well until the Jade Circus reaches the court of Kublai Khan, ruler of Cathay in 13th century china. There Bo challenges the Mongols to a kite ride, where the first person to come back to earth lost the bet. Haoyou wins, but he also happens to land in the Khans place of worship, a wagon full of grass and earth from the Mongolian steppes. This infuriates the Khan, and Haoyou is almost killed for his crime, had he not been offered as a secret weapon in the Khans moving army.  This novel was really not that great a book for me personally. It was just too short and lacking that factor that makes me want to read more of it. It was far too simple a plot too. Its like a ten page book with 250 pages of vague details scattered in between the words. This is the first book I have read by Geraldine McCaughrean, and it is not inspiring me to read the second.  
 I quit reading this book after 225 pages. Like most of the books I give 2 stars, I'm going to leave that one statement as a major testament to what this book did for me. I don't know if it's fair or not. I'm sure scores of Bloom fans will say I'm too ignorant to understand it. Maybe I am. But the purpose of writing a review is to be consistent in rating the books I read. I find the lack of lower ratings on many books puzzling. If you read a book and it isn't to your liking, you should say so. For me, this was of very little interest, and just wasn't a very good book.  I found the commentary about Adam and Eve to be the most interesting part of the book. Everything else, including the Book of J itself, was hard to take. The introductory piece before the translation was downright painful, and the only thing that got me through it was the notion that the actual book couldn't be much worse. I was right, that it couldn't be much worse. But it wasn't really any better either. For me, these stories are too transitory and scattered to be of much interest.  The commentary starts off well, but then sinks into an almost desperate attempt to declare that J is a) a woman, b) the main influence of Shakespeare, and c) the main influence of many classic Western voices (Tolstoy/Freud/Kafka/etc). After 225 pages, I got so sick of hearing this assertion that I quit the book and stared out the train window for the next 45 minutes. The total lack of focus and drove me bonkers.  I think scholars of the subject might enjoy the book, but casual fans of literary works will have a tough time with it. As a reference, I have read Michener's Source, and recently Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Both are steeped in religion, and both held my interest for many pages, the latter more than either. But this book, well, it was very difficult for me to keep at. Those who don't already have a working knowledge of the subject matter are going to struggle with this.  It's not necessarily that I think this book is lousy. It's just impossible for me to really identify with. And in that sphere of existence, the one I live in, it's a 2 star book, simply because I would rather watch the buildings, cars, and grass go by the train window than read it any further. Take it for what it's worth, but that was my experience.  Not for the casual reader 
 Anti-Flag's existence as they do is the definition of hypocrisy and irony. Not only is their music nowadays extremely tame, melodic and accessible (things, especially accessability, most would agree punk rock isn't supposed to be), but their anti-establishment preaching and left/liberal lyrics don't hit home at all due to the fact that they're signed to RCA Records, a major corporation.  For all of their lyrical babbling against corporate power, greed, war, and fascism, they have proven they indirectly support those things exactly in order to get a wider audience. Their abandonment of their own label (AF Records) as a method of release and their giving in to major labels proves that ideologically they are nowhere where they claim to be.  The music of this album is just as bad, if worse, than the Terror State. Their "radical" lyrics continue, but despite the arguably good message they seem to have overall (despite the hypocrisy noted earlier), the backdrop of idiotic picked note melodies reminiscent of pop punk are enough to drive any fan of other political punk (hardcore, crust and anarcho) out of their mind.  Overall, the album would be just another bad modern "punk" release if it was released on Epitaph or an equivalent. Instead, it is a bad modern pseudo-punk release released by a corporate record label for mass distribution and consumption by the brainwashed masses. Fans of real punk should listen to Crass and turn a 180 on these jokesters claiming to be political 
 I used this book for a fluid mech course and I thought this book is terrible.  The derivations of the equations are though but that doesn't make up for what this book lacks.  The problems are quite difficult since the material covered in the chapters doesn't match what the questions ask.  I don't expect a textbook to entertain me but this one put me to sleep a lot.  There are (literally) hundreds of references to video clips demonstrating different topics covered but they weren't put on the included CD.  And speaking of the CD, it is completely worthless.  Don't even bother wasting your time looking at it since it contains very little useful information.  There are a few more detailed explanations of a few of the topics in a few chapters but that is it.  There is no real meat there.  I gave this book 2 stars only because I did like the thoroughness of the derivations other than that this book is a waste of your time and money.  And if one opinion may not count out of a class of 35 about half of us hated the book (it was doubtful the other half had even read it).  If you have to use this book, good luck 
 It is amazing that Armenians can rewrite history based on forged documents and lies. Armenians were some of the richest Ottoman citizens that held high positions in the government. They believed the lies of colonial European powers, such as Russia, Britain, France, with the promise of an independent state, and attacked the Ottoman Army from the rear. Armed with the weapons given to them by the Allies, they massacered hundreds of thousands of unarmed innocent Turkish civilians. While the Turkish men were at war fighting at many theathers of war, the Armenian men stayed home, because they were exempt from military service. "They raped any Turkish women they found. They extracted the babies from expecting Turkish mothers with their bayonets. They stuffed the innocent Turkish elderly men, women, and children,into their mosques and burnt them alive. Even Russian generals at the scene, who witnessed these heinous acts, called them the most barbarous race they had ever seen". The Ottoman government re-located them out of the war zone, in self defence. Any other country would have punished them much more severely for these treasonous and barberous acts. Calling this relocation a genocide is disingenous, at the very least. The rewiver is saddened by loss of life suffered by the Armenians during the re-location process. Most of the deaths were caused by attacking Kurdish and Circussian bandits for revenge and booty. The number of Armenian deaths have been greatly exaggerated. The Ottoman Government was unable to protect them any better, because the country was in turmoil, at the time, due to the great war 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 OK - I went into this book hoping it would be a James Michener-type epic with sweeping characters and a grand sense of the rich field of Middle Eastern history since World War II. What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.   The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach). I stopped reading about halfway through.  My grade: F 
 I seldom pan books, but this one is little more than an egotistic rehash of simplified versions of AI/AL theories of the past 3 decades. The only new data are the author's opinions. If you are looking for anything new and/or in depth, look elsewhere 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 Like most circuit design books, DIC doesn't cover issues that a serious circuit designer should know about. It does not mention or barely covers transistor sizing techniques, drive strengths for standard cell libraries, antenna rule checks, synthesis, and signal integrity issues like crosstalk. Sequencing elements like flipflops and latchs and memory design are covered poorly. Despite this, pipelining and parallelism are covered fairly effectively compared to other texts. Many other circuit design books are also fairly outdated now with respect to semiconductor technology. For instance at 10um cmos technology, leakage power is significant, but a casual reader would never know that you should increase the transistor threshold voltage or lengths on circuits on non-critical timing paths to control this nanometer effect 
 The chapters are not of consistent strength or substance.  And then too, I came across a number of instances where statements were made without any attempt to support them with specific examples.  I cannot offer specifics instances of the aforementioned because I have already discarted the book.  This was required reading for a college course 
 Hi,  I purchased of one these pools for my then 4 yr old daughter and she did enjoy it for a shiort while, then one morning I went to check on the pool which was covered with a large blue tarp since it does not come with a cover and to my surprise the pool was totally deflated and the whole middle and bottom of the pool was gone, apparently the crows liked how it tasted and ate the pool and just the sides of the pool.  Millions and millons of tiny bits of plastic ppol were left all over our backyard and it took hours for my daughter and I to pick up.  I would never have guessed the pool would be eaten!  It was fun for the few days she played in it but maybe seeing this review just maybe they will also provide a hard cover for this pool.  We are left without a pool since this is gone.  Maybe the manufacture shoud make the bottom not so tasty for the birds and more durable so kids can enjoy it longer.  I have heard of one other person who had this experience as well.  Warning:  Kepp this pool away from birds!  I have been advised by a rep at Amazon to purchase reflective tape to place around the pool to ward off the birds!  We are hoping we do not have the same experience when we purchase the Family Size Center Pool.  Best Regards,  The Youngs Family. 
 Absolutely no use to me whatsoever. Next 
 Reading this book was like reading a soap opera script. Nothing happened, the same events were rehashed over and over and everything is revealed through a secret window the reader has into the thoughts of the characters. The story was weak, the characters far worse and the premise completely ridiculous. Why would any woman, depressed or otherwise, allow their 11-year-old daughter to continue a strange friendship with a strange older man she met on the beach? Implausible. Especially for someone who has lost all her loved ones, to even take the chance with the daughter being lost, insane. Danielle Steel is a terrible writer, that is if she even writes these books anymore. Poor writing, poor editing...what a waste of my time 
 Public Budgeting Systems by Robert D. Lee, Philip G. Joyce, and Ronald Wayne Johnson is written more clearly... if you have a choice, buy this book.  The problem with Mikesell is that he has to write 200 pages (six chapters) to explain the concept of revenues in the budget process.  Too many trees were wasted in the development of this book.  Lee, Joyce, and Johnson can do this in 40 pages.  The greater majority of my Public Budgeting Systems class at George Mason University feels that the Mikesell book is written in a manner to lull oneself to sleep... the benefit is that one could read the book rather than using drugs to induce sleep.  However, if you are required to purchase the Mikesell book, you should go to the Amazon UK web site and complete your transaction there... you can save yourself about 70 to 80 dollars.    
 I downloaded this b4 it came out and I'm glad I downloaded it. "Oh I Think They Like Me" was an aiight song when it dropped but "Lean Wit It Rock Wit It" got played out the 2nd time I heard it. Only good songs on this album are: My Music (cuz Bun B is on it) Bricks 4 The High (cuz Jim Jones on it, beat is good) Ridin' Rims (hot) Don't Play Wit Me (Three 6 Mafia can't even save DFB on this one. but ok)  
 Growing up in the Delta I find a lot to dislike about this exercise in academic revisionism of Southern history. The author is clearly ignorant of those times that shaped the history of the Delta, the floods of 1927 and '37 followed by the migrations of black people to the North followed by the mechanical cotton picker, followed by the emmigration of light industry to the "new" south. This superficial book is typical of the ideological rectitude among apologists that permeate parochial history departments. A person wishing to understand the psyche of the Delta should read instead, "Lanterns on the Levee",or "Rising Tide", both available from Amazon.com 
 Please, I beg you, purchase one of her other books!  I have read nearly all of Aiken's works and they are FANTASTIC.  However, this book was very cut-and-dried, dull, and prejudiced.  The characters of the island people were so caricatured that it was borderline offensive.  No child deserves to have to read this book 
 Or perhaps I should have said Nazi-science. Extremist Budiansky seems to have picked up where the likes of the Nazi-mentality left off. This absurd diatrbe should certainly not be listed amongst any legitimate science writings as it has nothing to do with real science, but rather, the author attempts to pass off his hateful agenda of others, as science; nonsense. Do yourself a favor---save your hard-earned money, you certainly won't be missing anything with this one....except precious time 
 sad to say, I was misled by all the 5 star reviews and bought this cd.  I was expecting something extraordinary.  this is not it.  i am a true reggae believer and my ears are always wide open for something new.  this aint it.  its soft and boring.  hate being negative about postivie music, but this album just doesn't add up 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 The information is incorrect!  You can't print this thing out!  Had I known that, I would've dropped the $8 on a paper copy 
 Mission:Impossible, the TV series, told the adventures of the Impossible Missions Force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins, foreign dictators, terrorists and others who threatened the security of the United States. Rather than engage in James Bond-like shoot outs, the IMF team worked together to covertly neutralize threats, leaving little or no trace of their involvement. Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show.  Along comes Brain De Palma's catastrophe of a remake, starring that couch-jumping Scientologist Tom Cruise. Within half an hour of the film starting, the entire IMF team, save for Cruise, is killed off, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original Mission:Impossible is shot to hell. Granted, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are present as Cruise's new team, but Mission:Impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another Tom Cruise vehicle where he preens and postures. Making a film called Mission:Impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original TV series. It's obscene what Tom Cruise's ego has done to Bruce Geller's original concept. This is just another action film with Mr. Cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself. See the original TV series and skip this piece of bastardized trash 
 Like her fellow misguided evangelical Larry Crabbe, this woman quickly puts the label of "sin" on problems that are more complex.  Being told that they are sinners who need to repent is the last thing that people who are struggling with eating disorders need to hear.  I think it is this belief about themselves that drives many of them to eating disorders in the first place.  The book just pushes evangelical Christian dogma without seeking a proper understanding of the issues it discusses 
 I have owned a Palm since they were first produced by US Robotics. This is by far the worst for reliability. I never had any problems with prior models (Palm 500, Palm III, Palm IIIxe). This is the second T5 I have had. I returned the first one because it constantly locked up (just like an old windows PC), and when it was working, the hot-sync would fail a lot of the time. I am ready to send the replacement they sent me back because the battery lasts about 2 DAYS even when I am not using it. Then I have a hard time getting it to turn on. I usually have to leave it plugged in for an extended period of time until it finally decides to turn itself on. What a waste of money. I wish I still had my Palm IIIxe 
 Many of the recipes use an abundance of heavy cream, half and half, whole milk or butter. I'm sure these dishes taste good, but people I cook for don't need to eat such rich food.  
 To build up a thesis and a book title on Edison like this is uninformed and dishonoring to Edison. Edison was no 'mere' inventor, but a much more broad thinker and leader of non-violence. It is a misnomer to think of an 'Edison gene' that makes people good hunters. Edison was committed to non-violence and NOT hunting. This book regards ADHD, a quality that, in an ancient, dangerous, changing world, may indeed have been to some benefit. But Edison was no hunter.  Thomas Edison wrote that, "Non-violence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages."  Edison, a true thinker, rejected the violence of hunting and killing, and was a committed vegetarian. 
 We've received this toy as a gift from our friends and i liked the idea of 2 sides (is like having 2 new toys at once). But then, when we tried playing with it i didn't like several things: 1) side 1  - has a really hard to squeak thing,  - hard to pull hammer  - pretty far located smiley face so the baby playing with it as an activity table (not crib mounted) won't easily reach and press it - smiley face could have more than 1 melody playing It results in that side having only 3 things to play for the baby at 6-8 months: spinning flower, spinning ball and a mirror  2) side 2 - the most i don't like in this toy (both sides) is the music of those 4 musical instruments buttons. It sounds not like it's a baby toy but like it's some kind of tool to horrify the baby. We have pretty much musical toys and none of them has the music which is soooo unpleasant. My baby just looks at tose buttons as she looks at strangers she doesn't like. - pop-up thing - could have a better holding door (opens easily) and prettier "animal" inside. - the squeaky knob on this side is hard to push even for me.  To summarize i'll just say that as for me even 2 sides are not worth the money!   I don't like it at all 
 Save your money and don't buy this.  The recording seemed to play like it was coming out of a box and about 20 minutes into the music, the CD started skipping.  Not once, not twice, but repeatedly over the course of 5 minutes.  While I can make some concessions for the skipping for packaging error, the quality of the sound makes this a worthless buy 
 This book carries a lot of assumptions on the authors beliefs.  It does not give practical advice on how to read auras 
 First of all, I have to give this collection at least 2 stars because it is RATT after all and there are some great tunes here. But in general, the Essentials series sucks. They try to put the big over-played radio tunes and leave out killer album cuts and fan favourites. They only have two tracks from Dancing Unvercover, my favourite Ratt release. The material from Detonator is the slow ballad crap and not the really high energy stuff. What a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and buy Dancing Undercover. If you still don't like Ratt after listening to that album, you never will 
 You know, I hate to burst the bubble of devoted Trotskyites across the globe, but Trotsky was just as responsible for Stalin's rule as anyone. For Leon to blame Stalin is the height of hypocrisy. Without Lenin's apparatus of social repression and Trotsky's apparatus of military dictatorship, Stalin would never have been. The Russian Revolution was never a win for workers. It destroyed them, some 4 million at Lenin's hands, 30 million by Stalin, and 65 million by Mao Tse-tung.  No policy or ideology that denies the soul can ever succeed. And communism does just that. By denying that which makes humans humans, it can bring only suffering 
 I love Jane Austen's works, and Persuasion, for me, comes next in line after Pride and Prejudice.  I think the story is more gentle and you really see a transformation in Anne.  The movie, however, I just didn't like.  The characters weren't portrayed well and I thought the movie was boring.  Anne in the movie had pretty much the same look on her face the whole movie which drove me nuts.  The guy who played Capt. Wentworth i thought was too angry most of the time.  I really couldn't enjoy this film because I couldn't get over the bad acting.  I'd love to see Persuasion redone with hopefully a better result.  My advice: read the book and skip the movie 
 It's really hard to write a serious review of this group or any other 70's lightweight pap bands. There's one good song here, "Strange Way" but otherwise it's mostly trite stuff that is better off forgotten.  Your better off searching out a mid-late 70's compilation CD rather than paying full price for a CD with 1 song and a bunch of filler 
 This is the book you read if you want to punish yourself for being a romantic. This book takes you from the total high you have when starting a new book, to the point of just wanting to cry and scream at the impossible blindness of the characters. And that was not a compliment of wonderful writing on the writers behalf. Nina wrote this long ass story that takes you on this wild ride that never finishes. IT never reaches a climax. It just builds and builds untill she drops the bomb that nothing good happens for the two main characters. You'd be better of saving your money and going to a funeral 
 When I plugged in this model, I couldn't believe how quiet it was compared to a previous model we owned.  It worked great for about 2 weeks, then stopped collecting water.  We followed all of the troubleshooting steps in the manual, but it still would not work.  I was very disappointed and out the $26 we spent on shipping.. 
 Unbelieveably bad album from Osucka Papsmear  I kinda knew this would suck before I bought it but it was the only way I could get the proof of purchase seal for the Misfits 45 they put out through Misfits records. You look at Horror High's roster and you get Michale Graves,Zombeast,Calabrese etc,etc all great bands and then compare them to the garbage being put out by Misfits records and I really don't know how long Misfits records can survive because it's roster should resemble some of the talent on Horror High's roster instead we're getting garbage like this from some 40+ yr olds trying to sound like 20yr olds trying to sound like early Blink 182 or something. I think Jerry Only is surrounded by too many Yes men and I'm kinda dissapointed Marky Ramone lent his name and time to this abortion of a CD. "Sailor Moon","Astro Boy"...P*#! OFF!! Whatever happened to songs like "ASTRO ZOMBIES" that's what I wanna know. 
 I was hoping for a great collection of vintage and rare Mickey Mouse cartoons. That's not what I got.  Steam Boat Willy was shown with a large black boarder surrounding the cartoon.  I assume it was so the entire frame could be seen.  Cartoons two and three were complete rare sound films.  However the remaining cartoons were not original prints.  The openings were created electronically.  The cartoons were very enjoyable but don't expect a collection of all original prints.  
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

 I've been using this shaver for almost a year, and am disappointed with it.  For years, I've used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because I feel like I'll drop it otherwise.  The big problem is with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood.  To clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With practice, it usually works the first time.  The funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s 
 I cannot recommend this book.  He puts forth some interesting ideas, but it is all conjecture.  There is no scientific or historical foundation.  It's all "could be", and "might be", and "may be", which becomes very frustrating.  It also lacks focus.  It drifts from topic to topic without a coherent driving thesis.  Save your time and money 
 Unfortunately, this book does not live up to its title.  It does provide a brief introduction to quite a number of models, theories and other published material with some explanation to what they are and when to use them. However, it does so rather superficially and the language is never quite right. It attempts to be practical, but never really succeeds; at least not if you have any prior experience with organizational change.  It is too much of an introduction with too loose a structure and never becomes relevant in its' recommendations and method 
 One of the labels for this Anchorman DVD labels the edition as "uncalled for", and I couldn't agree more- this movie was completely uncalled for and unnecessary.  In an edition of GameInformer magazine, Reiner and Joe recalled a conversation they had in which it took them several hours to "regain normal higher-level brain functions" after an unfortunate run-in at the movie theaters between them and Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne; I hate to say it, but I feel the same way about this movie. This movie literally made me feel stupid- but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour.  The part I did see, however, made me think of movies in which Will Ferrell was actually funny- movies like Elf, my personal favorite from Ferrell, or more recently Talladega Nights: The Story of Ricky Bobby. Anchorman really wasn't that interesting, I laughed at maybe one joke in the movie, and overall I hated the experience.  Good thing I watched it at a friend's house and not at the theaters- otherwise, I'd have to demand my money back 
 I like the fact that I can't really find a bad technique in this book.  The tone of the book is deadly serious, though the political overtones of WWII are imposable to ignore.  The reason I don't rate this book higher is because it is simply a series of self-defense sequenses; there is no real "system" presented.  The combinations shown herein are all valid, workable moves, taken from street boxing, catch wrestling, Japanese jujitsu, and WWII comando training.  While one can learn practical self-defense from this book, the lack of organization makes other books on the subject far more useful.  The aspect that suprised me was the ammount of catch wrestling techniques included, such as the toe hold and figure-four choke.  Another thing that this book had that isn't found in too many other souces was the use of your opponent's clothing, in a non-judo manner, to execute a technique.  Once again, the induvidual sequenses are good; it's just the lack of an organized system that I don't like.  OK for some good self-defense "tricks", but most other books are better 
 I bought this book and also Last Night based upon the gushing reviews you see above.  Who are they kidding? The main character is a cad.  It is far from "a tour de force" in erotic anything. His short stories in Last Night are only marginally better. Your time is better spent with other authors 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 Roughneck Nine-One is Frank Antonori's account of ODA 391's operations in the early phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  SFC Antonori paints his team as a group of professional black sheep bucking the system all the way to the cold hills of Kurdistan in Iraq.  By his account, his ODA fought the good fight and inflicted the damage claimed however luck and good technology (the Javelin anti-tank missle) best explained the results of the engagement at Debecka, Iraq. By his own admission Antenori's team was surprised by the enemy. The author then commits the error of suggesting his team took on a mechanized enemy Task Force.  A Task Force is a technical term for a combined arms battalion size element (roughly 500-700 personnel).  What Antenori describes as his enemy was a company size element known as a "Team", a size designation far smaller in size than a Task Force.  Furthermore, his description of the friendly fire incident suggests that the fault may well of rested in the way the target was described to the pilot rather than in pilot error.  At no time in the description does Antenori ever suggest that his team provided an azimuth from their own position to that of the enemy.  At best, the Roughnecks were lucky more than skilled 
 I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors.  The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery.  And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it.  I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out.  There is tons of static and extra noise.  Also, the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much.  Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag!!  Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend! 
 I've been a long time user of Trend Micro's PCcillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version I decided I didn't want to take a chance on it so I went looking for different anti-virus software. I stumbled onto this ZoneAlarm (piece of junk) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews I down loaded their trial.  It didn't seem too bad. After a few weeks I bought this 3 computer suite and installed it. I went a while longer and notice my computer's performance was not as good as it was. I downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new.  Now after about a month my computer is practically unusable (as well as the kid's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start).   This zonealarm is the worst software I have ever used.  It hogs CPU and memory.  It gets the CPU usage to 80 - 100% and it doesn't free it up.  I shut down all programs and CPU just keeps churning away. The interesting thing is that at times I would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90% but when you check the performance tab the CPU chart would be near 100%?  Go figure! I finally said enough and uninstalled it (and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry) and downloaded Trend Micro's pccillin.  It's installed and I got my old machine back.  Log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with ZA.  CPU is back to normal.  You couldn't give me this cr*ppy software.  I wish I would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $40 
 Have not read yet (hence only 1 star), but will. But Amazon reviewer, Gail Hudson, warns of "overly rigid boundaries (to the point of being righteous and judgmental)".  Hudson seems to assume that being "righteous" is be avoided. But Christians are called to righteousness and continual growth to more righteous behavior.   It is self-righteousness we must avoid, just as we are to avoid being judgemental. We must not avoid judging. Only the ignorant say "you must not judge me."  Jesus warns about judgmentalism but plainly teaches us how to judge: "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."  John 7:24  Many pastors/teachers fail to quote John 7:24, which sums up/balances other teachings on judgement. Paul exhorts us to judge, discern, admonish, confront, rebuke, etc.   Yes, Christ warns against being judgemental but teaches us to judge righteously.  PS Re Hudson's opener: mature believers don't want "to call themselves good Christians." They want to obey Christ 
 This book properly recognizes that election shenanigans are virtually an American tradition, but slinks into pure propaganda with its implicit and explicit contention that Democrats are solely to blame.  But, if there's an equivalent book out there for Democrats that focuses solely on the misdeeds of Republicans, then perhaps we all can agree that elections need protocols to determine fraud by officials, by parties, by voting equipment vendors, and by voters.  And that we especially need officials with an attitude capable of protecting the integrity of elections, and not one that pooh-poohs every conceivable threat.  Fund grossly undervalues two things, greatly damaging the value of his work.  First, he grossly underappreciates insider fraud.  In fact, with secret vote counting now the order of the with electronic voting, economics argues that elections can and will be up for sale to the highest bidder, and we'll never know any better.    Second, he grossly underappreciates the fact that ALL voting systems will be vulnerable and subject to attack, because elections have always been highly competitive events with a unhealthy dollop of dirty tricks.   Because all systems can be compromised, a good voting system is inexpensive and creates witnesses and EVIDENCE when cheating happens and also has a low payoff per election crime, while a bad voting system leaves little or no evidence, and a relatively small number of people can throw the election, getting a high payoff for their election crime.  Guess what?  Electronic voting leaves no evidence of hacking or rigging if it's done properly, insiders are the most likely culprits, and the payoff for a single crime can easily be the whole election.   Paper ballots, while subject to felon voting, double voting and the ills Funds describes in this book, leave EIVDENCE.   In fact, this is the very reason Fund is able to write a book about them!   They were caught, in most cases!    In a democracy we should not be quick to blame the people as pretty soon the people may be considered untrustworthy and then we don't have a democracy any more.  Instead, since voting is a right, let people freely exercise the right, and then punish AFTERWARD the abuse of that right, being careful to create systems where it's hard for an abuse to yield more than one vote.  Paper ballots are easy on the tax dollar, and meet this bill.  Despite the thousands of people trying to cheat the election system, it's a good system, and the rats are getting a might small piece of cheese with paper ballots.  In contrast, you can see Howard Dean on the web hecking an election in less than 60 seconds.   I kid you not.  The only solution is total openness and observation by all parties, watching each other like hawks 
 Unfortunately the recipes I tried from this book did not taste good and turned out rubbery.  I do not recommend it.  
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 Real estate is a localized market, but this book is written for a general real estate market. It should focus on one market so that we can understand the analysis and apply it to our own market. Missing many important info when discussing about a market crash such as historical affordability compared to today, historical price reduction, impact of increasing foreclosure, loan origination and percentage (ex. $9 trillion dollars lend out on mortgage in the U.S. 46% are adjustable mortgage. $1 trillion in loan will turn over to the new rate in 2007, another $1 trillion in 2008....etc) Is notice of default and bankruptcy increased lately? How much? What about the impact of oil prices on real estate? What about the new bankrupcy law? any impact?  Sell, rent, then buy back is folly according to the author, but never consider sell, rent, invest in other rising markets, then buy back.  Excellent section on job growth forecast with good web links 
 I couldn't stomach this movie for long. I kept waiting, hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge but the language, nudity, and explicit sexual content was too much for me so I turned it off and never saw the entire film. If there was any poignant, brilliant story with any depth, it was buried in filth and raunch. I would not recommend film this to anyone. Nicholas Cage or not, it was disgusting.  
 Being a fan of Scott and his writings, I expected much more from this book than it was able to offer.  Although the actual writing of the book is excellent, conveying wonderfully the flavor and character of the times as well as the vanity of the monarchs and suitors, the plot ends abruptly with a tragic ending.  Aside from altogether disliking tragedies, I found this ending a surprising disappointment because the book gave very little indication of the horrific climax which was to come.  After finishing the last page, I almost felt as though I had finished reading two separate books - a romance and a traged 
 I was given this book as a gag gift. I regret the day that I actually read it. Here's the basic message "Be good.", it's nice that so many adults are willing to be maniuplated by a statement that has haunted them since Kindergarten. If you need a solution merely "Being good" is not a solution. Change something within yourself. Don't avoid the actual problem. And most of all DON'T preach about this book to other people, they might sucker-punch you, I know I would 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 This book started out entertaining but then it really dragged on.  Maybe I didnt understand something, but I felt the second half of the book was really a waste of my time.  I had a really hard time finishing it 
 This might make a good book for your teenage kid trying to learn about small business but other than that I dont think it would be helpful.  If you really want the details of how to create and grow a real business (especialy high tech) and get funded, you should read "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"  (Stathis).  It makes this book looks like preschool. 
 After seeing Field of Dreams, I was excited to get the book and fill in the holes of the story and figure out what was left out of the movie. But you know what? It didn't happen? Why? Because the movie is only vaguely "based on" this book. For good reason, too. The book is terrible. As in poorly written, mostly boring, and largely kinda dumb.  I don't know who the Field of Dreams screenwriter is, but Kinsella should be on his knees kissing the guy's (or girl's) feet every morning. He turned this largely unreadable mess of a novel into a moving, funny, classic movie.   One example? In the movie, the revelation that the main character is REALLY building the field for his father doesn't come until right at the end, setting up an improbably emotional moment--even for most men who've seen the film. In the book, it's on about page 10. Shoeless Joe appearing is practically an aside--even though it's the dang title of the book!  Don't waste your time reading this book...and definitely don't waste the money. If you've ever seen Field of Dreams, it will only taint the movie experience for you 
 Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW.  
 I tried to read this book, and can't get through all the humor. I'm looking for real meat and, but I can't seem to wade through all the chatter and jokes. I think I'll give up and resell it and find another book on Mac OS X Tiger. I buy a lot of "how to" books and and usually enjoy them, but this has to be one of the less helpful ones I've bought. I used to enjoy his 1-page magazine articles, but a whole book is too much 
 No, you didn't. You read about 300 pages of gossip, slander and supposition. The font size is so big, when I first opened this book, I thought I had bought the "large print" version by mistake.  Yes, as many have noted, this book seems to "read fast" for a history book. But the number of words per page can also be used to guage the research and thought that Fleming put into his attack on "the New Dealers."  Any potential buyer might be advised to use the "look inside" feature to compare a page of this book with, for example, an excerpt from Robert Dallek's "Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy" or James MacGregor Burns' "Roosevelt: Soldier of Freedom." Eric Larabee's "Commander in Chief" is even more packed with information 
 Please, your reviews are going to be read by adults who want to buy gifts for their little girls, nieces, and granddaughters. Anyways, this doll is nuts! I already reviewed her, but I had to again when I realized how trashy that one girl was talking! No curse words, puh-lease!  Parents, please DO NOT buy this awful doll. 
 The Sluggers Club is an okay book, but I think it is pretty boring. It has an exciting beginning and ending though. Most baseball finds would enjoy it 
 this is really the most boring book i have ever read. i read the whole thing, waiting in vain for something good to happen, and while i was waiting, in vain, the book ended. that was it. the last page. no climax, no excitment. i could say that something good did happen, the book ended, but with a name like "the black album", you might expect something more ingriguing. maybe something having to do with, and this is a stretch....a black album. maybe i missed something, but the title and the fact that it did end were the 2 best things about this book. that, and i bought it either used, or on clearance. 
 back in the day i remember my friends babbling about this band called texas is the reason, but i never gave them a chance for some reason. so i did today, and i am extremely disappointed. someone said this band sounds like further seems forever and all those other new pop punk bands, but i would say it sounds like a high school band trying to sound like the current pop punk trend.the recording and production quality is considerably poor as well, dont waste your money kids...just turn mtv back on and let them make your music choices for you 
 Plain and simple, this sheet music collection has a good number of interesting songs, but the print quality is very poor. The guitar chords are unreadable on some songs, and the piano music, while readable, isn't crisp at all. It looks like a cheaply bound photocopy 
 While I generally share Joe Consason's political sensibilities, and I am a fan of his column on (at?) Salon.com, I found this book to be a disappointment. Too often Mr. Conason seems utterly scandalized by minor transgressions on the part of Republicans/conservative pundits, or posits innuendo as fact. To be fair, at several points he does intelligently treat some genuinely egregious instances of mendacity, hypocrisy, and/or venality on the part of the American far-right over the last few years. Here his commentary is illuminating, and his conclusions are sound. Also, throughout the book, one never gets the sense that Mr. Conason is motivated by meanness or vindictiveness in any of his contentions. Yet ultimately the book can be characterized by (dare I say) what are at times partisan and dubious assertions.   (For a truly sober, superbly researched, and utterly convincing look at the ascendancy of the far-right, and what has been a well-financed (and highly successful) campaign of distortion, read Eric Alterman's superp "What Liberal Media." 
 Love the Beatles since childhood, of course John and Paul solo, even the occasional Ringo, but George always will have a special place as the unappreciated and vastly under-rated 3rd musical genius of the group. In many ways George was deeper on a spiritual and emotional level, which I believe was best reflected in his music and ability, all the while continuing to stay in the backdrop of Lennon-McCartney. I think both John and Paul consciously and unwittingly each burned this man to their own detriment. I think Paul realized this a bit too late, sadly, and may also regret not having spent a fraction of the time he used up in his downturn periods with John.    I have most of George's work on vinyl, cassette and CD, and my spouse and kids are very well aquainted with the majority of his work, whether they know the titles or not. I was very saddened by his passing, and of course wistful as I had been with John's passing - because I knew we were being "robbed" again of what might still have been to come. So I just had to get his last release, placing it ahead of anything else that might be on my musical wish list. It saddens me to say that I think George, of course knowing his condition and the inevitabile, likely just kind of let go. Maybe it just was a simple release from what he had previously wanted to accomplish, maybe he felt he had nothing left to prove (too true), or maybe he just wanted to express and vent - no frills. Maybe worse, he just didn't have it any more. For me though, it just wasn't the George that pierces the heart, mind and soul, that brings one to a deeper appreciation of how profound our relationships are and  what they should be or make us feel. This wasn't the same George, and I will miss him that much more.    
 I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option 
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'.  My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh.  Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces 
 I am glad that Elder recognizes that applying his concepts to short-term trading, such as daytrading, is much harder than applying them to a longer time horizon.   His basic premise is that stocks tend to travel within channels. This is a volatility mean reversion argument, which when taken to its limit essentially argues that volatility does not exist - that stocks do not gap up or down and that when a stock breaks out of or down through its channel, it's automatically a long or a short (in the opposite direction of the respective move).   I couldn't disagree more.   If you apply Elder's concepts to daytrading, for example, you will lose all of your money. I did.  But, if you have a longer time horizon - such as a multi-day holding period, you could very well apply his concepts with some success - just be sure to apply his premise of stocks travelling within channels to stocks that recently FINISHED breaking out of or down through thier channels as opposed to stocks that are in a relatively tight range (primed for breakout). I'm very surprised that Elder doesn't address how volatility mean reversion can easily kill his style of trading if not applied properly to stocks that are consolidating.   In any case, take this book with a grain of salt as it is likely the first important trading book you'll read, but certainly (hopefully) not the last 
 Italy has been using the Euro for over two years.  These lessons spend much time teaching the student about Lira.  It also spends time teaching you BIG NUMBERS.  That is really useless when dealing in Euros! Pull this product off your site until it joins the 21st century!  The Italian speaking woman is also very difficult to understand.  She does not have a clear voice when it comes to the endings of words.  
 Historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of Byzantium. Think of only what the labeling "Byzantine" means today. If you want to know more about Byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by Sir Steven Runciman 
 Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: "Signs," "Sweet City Woman," "One Fine Morning" and "Gimme Dat Ding" - and the last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year before the others.  The star of this show is Lighthouse's "One Fine Morning," and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter.  It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on "Music From NFL Films" - it had that quality about it.  As for the other eight offerings: If they wanted to pick some obscure stuff, why didn't they go all the way and throw in Dusk's "Treat Me Like A Good Piece Of Candy?&quot 
 I encountered this gem as a wannabe text book in 1998.    The author makes a big deal out of using movies as a self help device. The problem I have with this book how the author judges the movies he presents. Get a copy and read "Solomon's" description of your favorite movie. It as if he stretches his views and theory's around a movie that just are not there. A case in point is The Great Santini / The Gift of Fury (1979). A coming of age movie with a dedicated Marine Pilot as the father. Gary Solomon treats this movie as Child Abuse. Gary misses the point completely. Once you begin to actually look at the movies he recommends his Prescription falls flat on its face! It is the same self help mumbo jumbo for a buck that hits the book stores every day. I would go so far as to say this is a Toxic book. Toxic in the same way as using aspirin to grow hair on your head.    If a college instructor hands this book to you hand it back and drop the class 
 The gist of this book is that if your child is defiant, it must be because you, the parent, is too controlling.  Give the child what he wants and quit bugging him.    Um, no.  Has this author ever spent any time with a defiant preschooler?  If I didn't try to control him somewhat, he'd spend most of his life naked in front of the tv eating cookies.  This book was no help at all. 
 I bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers.  Let me be candid....what the hell were they reading?  This book is simply insipid, implausible and a waste of time.  Get this for a premise....rich, geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the "Connecticut Nutmegs"!  Nutmegs for a major league team??!!  Yeah, right.  It gets better....he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the C-list movies he produces....ok hold on to your seats, here comes the good part....she is going to be his star player on this MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL team!!  Why, because in college she was an excellent athlete.  So some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball!!  Am I the only one who thinks this is plain stupid.  Oh, yeah there's a murder along the way.  Parker (author) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise I can't think of a reason why it got published.              
 The author returns to the same source material far too often -- the variety of movies from which the quotations and trivia are taken is seriously lacking. Coupled with the flawed layout and cheap feel of the book, and you get one large waste of time. Save yourself the grief of reading this ... and go rent a handful of DVDs 
 The editor's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid Lifestyle magazine, which you'll enjoy only if you're like her -- rich, creepily entitled, self-absorbed, and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining, but not really food or actual cooking itself. 
 Wouldn't you think with the title of the collection being "When the sun goes down" that it would actually include the video to the song "When the sun goes down"?  Apparently NOT!  The only reason I ordered this DVD was for the video/song titled the same as the collection and it's not even there.   
 In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose  
 They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth.   Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out. 
 It was an insult the first time around when Criterion didn't release this title in an optional 3D format. I was hopeful when the announcement came for a reissue; But guess what? Nothing changed to remedy the situation. They could've had me buying a second copy if they cared enough. The 3D glasses included with Freddy's Dead on DVD made for a wonderful experience. I've never had eye strain problems with 3D, and I suspect those who whine about it are simply more fussy, with little real desire to enjoy the enhancement. I wouldn't care so much, but this title was conceived and shot to be seen in 3D. To present it out of its intended context is not only an insult to the director and technical crew, but to the audience as well. I guess this means I'm off to find a bootleg 3D version elsewhere... 
 Clearly not the best from this author. The story starts well but does not fulfill its promises. I had a hard time reading it through the end 
 Another in the long line of promosexual strongarming from the left. far-far left. I cannot remember ever reading something this boorish.  Avoid it please 
 Spend almost 1 dollar a minute.  Have fun!  : 
 I have read about three quarters of this book and my biggest problem with it is that the testimonials by the boys seem really contrived, as if their words have been doctored up or forged. He has interviews with twelve year olds that flow so beautifully and articulately that it actually comes off as very inorganic and makes you wonder whether or not these kids' words have been doctored up. The vocabulary these kids use is often too sophisticated sounding for their age 
  This book is riddled with fallacies and very poorly organized. Although some of the ideas were interesting, it seemed like the author just made everything up! It's amazing that something like this actually got published.   I think this paragraph about the author's "trip" to one of the astral planes speaks for itself.   "Suddenly the figure of the evil Darth Vader came out of the woods... My astral sense of humor was in attendance, as I created a can of spinach, opened it with miniature lightning bolts, and consumed this can of power immediately.   Just like Popeye, my fists grew in size, and I punched Darth Vader right through his helmet..."  How stupid does the author really think we are? This obviously reflects his opinion of the readers of his book.   If you want to expand spiritually, I suggest reading something by Thich Nhat Hanh, or any author that knows what they're writing about.  
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 The story would be alot better if this guy new how to describe ANYTHING. Short exerpts from his description of a character, "tall black man," another exerpt, "white man," and another, "naked blond woman." (...), I would've been happy to read the phrase nubian goddess as a description, but nope, couldn't even get that descript.  I may not be rascist, but I think the writer probably is. I'm still slowly drudging through this book because I'm having trouble getting past the horrible writing.  I'm also upset because the binding in my book fell apart 
 Meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile: Suzanne Clothier (Bones would rain from the Sky) Patricia McConnell (The other end of the Leash) Turid Rugaas (Calming Signals)  We have three Irish Setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
 This book is way to simplified - It doesn't have step-by-step pictures for knotting some difficult knots (3 pictures just won't do it for beginners like me) 
 Let's not even discuss the countless laws our heroine violated in her attempt to escape her abusive husband.  Laws, that were completely overlooked by the authorities in the resolution of this piece of work.  Lets go to the stereotyped characters, the completely predictable plot,  the outrageous 'chemistry' of the two main lovers and the mindless banter that was being passed off as witty conversation.  The bad guy was completely bad, the heroine was perfectly good, the hero was a pillar of strength, the son was every parents' dream, the cops were all cliches of one type or another...The characters were perfect examples of cardboard cut-outs.   Max and Caroline had romantic sparks flying the minute they saw each other and it was hilarious...There is no way a real person in real life could think and act like those two...These two would make a great Saturday NIght Live satire of afternoon soap operas.  Detective Jolley was a hoot...If you didn't see what was coming for him you were not payng attention which could have easily been the case.  The plot I thought had possibilities but it was wasted.  Yes, I know Rob Winters was one of them (a cop), but come on...Nobody could see the obvious here?  Finally, of all the things I did not like about this book, there was the scene in the kitchen with Max, Tom, Caroline and Dana.  Why Caroline (or Max)didn't just smack Dana for her witty comments (more like witless) is beyond me.  Somecody should have just told her to shut the H... up.   This was not good natured banter among friends.  This was drivel.   I bought another Karen Rose book at the same time I purchased this one.  I'm not sure if I will give it a try or not.  This book could have been written by a middle school student who would have been satisfied with a grade of 'C'.   I gave it two stars only because I was able to finish it and I wanted to see how the author wrapped it up.          
 Not  a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read. 
 Anyone else disappointed in this book? It seems to center on the wardrobe the most. I know it is difficult for the authors to show detailed images of the vehicles of the first trilogy, since they are all digital. But this book pales in comparison to the first Star Wars Chronicles. I can't recommend it as you can find pretty much the same material in the "Making of" EP1,2,3 books, all of which can be found for cheap.   The photographs all seemed washed out...all lacking crisp rich colors as in the first book. For the costumemaker/modelmaker/toy collector/true fanboy this book would be a great addition..I personally am not satisfied.  
 Having been a quant, it occured to me that I could develop a Monte Carlo football simulator, then back test it according to different betting strategies by running simulated games thousands of times over using previous statistical data.  Two things went wrong.  One, I bought this book which I found helped me learn little about sports betting.  Two, a company of quants has just introduced earlier this year a Monte Carlo simulator (Statshark) and for a montly fee, you can pay for their predicition services.  Alex Alaniz   1.

 Was "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential" not enough? Were Joel Osteen's seven steps not clear enough? If not, realize a journal is not the solution.  Trying to mix the positive thinking of Robert Schuller, and the faith movement theology of Paul Yonggi Cho and Kenneth Copeland, Osteen has taken the stadium seminar circuit to a new level. Augmented now by his book, "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential" he pushes the find the god/champion within yourself.  Here, we see he has a journal to help point out what is not difficult to understand with his book. However, the main book is not making any points that a journal will enhance, and only the lowliest of sheep will need the extra help. This is a better tool than his study guide in that it forces more action, as opposed to just thinking about what to do.   If Osteen's book is inspirational, hopefully it inspires action rather than complacency. However, if you're discovering you are working your way through another Joel Osteen book, or have just worked through a pile of Joyce Meyers books, let it be a sign that getting excited about setting the past behind is not enough. Diversify and try something more challenging, and ascertain that next month, you will have made changes.  People who are down on their luck, or discouraged with life will find Osteen a good read. It is a feel-good book, reducing the image of Christianity to be about us and not about God.  "Getting your mind off of yourself," with the goal of self-fulfillment should appeal also to readers of Wayne W. Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.   Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office. Maybe this is why he has created both a study guide and journal. Reading like a seminar set to print, it sums as quickly as reading through its self-determinist table of contents:   1. Enlarge your vision  2. Develop a healthy self-image  3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words  4. Let go of the past  5. Find strength through adversity  6. Live to give  7. Choose to be happy   The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are. Within their religious context, evangelicals and charismatics will likely find offense at Osteen's assertions about controlling your own destiny as opposed to letting God control it.   Aim a little higher, and check out Charles Colson's "The Good Life." The title sounds similar, but Colson defines what makes for a good life far differently than Osteen. Save your money, and if your have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.  Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 I read this book from back to cover (it is less than 200 pages) and came away rather dissapointed. None of the topics are explored in any length and many of the ideas can be found in Guerilla Marketing, including existing music industry articles on the internet. Many of of the websites that are cited resulted in dead links and I found some of the ideas outdated. Chapter 12 is an insult to readers with three pages devoted to setting up an internet record label; and Chapter 14 devoting four and a half pages to home recording. Overall, I felt the material lacked passion and could use an injection of new ideas.      
 First of all I am a big fan of this band.  However, this CD left me greatly disappointed.  It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired.  Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did.  Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark.  Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best.  I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ... DUL 
 I agree with the comment below.  Boring.  I also have read all the books in the series and look forward to each new one.   This one was not up to the standard I expected with the In Death Series. By the end of the first chapter you knew the killer and why.  The conflict with Mira didn't fit either. Maybe the next one will be better 
 I'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story, but it wasn't worth the cost of finding it.  Started reading this and got 100 pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references, historical meanderings, and pointless speculations.  Seems like this book's real purpose is to test the reader's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written, intriguing story.  It was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings, I think, do so because they're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth.  Call me stupid then, but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings. My congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this 533 page snooze fest.  You have my admiration for your tenacity.  I note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful.  But take a look at lots of reviews of this book.  The majority of them say it is a long, boring slog, then they give it a 3 star rating.  How helpful is that?  
 Raymonde Carroll's book, a must-read when it came out, is now unfortunately way outdated. To that, add a poorly done translation... I was going to use Carroll's book in my French classes, but it was so bad that I picked Polly Platt's "Savoir-Flair" instead. 
 My friend has this cd and he sings along with these lyrics meaningfully.  It makes me sick.  I don't like this band, all this guy talks about is how he's sad, becuase he broke up with his girlfriend.  1 or 2 songs is alright, but the cd is full of these songs.  The guitar work is unimpressive, alll he does is play easy chords, or uses wierd tunings.  I'm not agianst acoustic music(I like Dave Mathew's slow stuff), but this is horrible 
 I have not recieved the book......please someone contact me NOW, this is the 2nd purchase I have made and not recieved my book! Very Upset!!!  Please help me! 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 I think Cheryl Jarvis needs to get a grip on reality! What kind of wife wants to take a 3 month sabbatical from her husband and family to find herself? People like her need to wake up and remember the commitment she made to her husband and children! Life can be hard sometimes, and can take us all on a ride we don't like or in the wrong direction. Women like these need to realize that they have made other commitments now and have to stick with them! Her children come to her and ask her not to leave...... doesn't that right there give her the clue that maybe her dreams and goals have changed and being a wife/ mother is what she is now! This is why you see divorces at like 60% now because no one wants work at a marriage anymore, when it gets too hard they just pick up and leave! I don't like the message this book is giving and don't recommend it to anyone! You have problems with your life, talk it out with your husband. Don't read a book from a person who doesn't know the first thing about marriage! What ever happen to talking things out 
 I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart.  But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin 
 Ya same problem here I THOUGHT I was ordering the book but turns out its some stupid guidebook and some CD's! I believe it is only fair that the seller gives a full refund!! I need the book for class on TUESDAY AGH!!!! 
 Okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as "Bring it on", "Clueless", "Mean Girls" and, especially the superior "Heathers".. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. I'm sorry but, "John Tucker Must Die" is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films. These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. "JTMD" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. "Heathers" = 5 stars. "Mean Girls" = 4 stars. "Bring it on" = 4 stars. "Clueless" 4.5 stars. All four of these movies have something that "John Tucker Must Die" doesnt have..  
 The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.  If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].  If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
 First, let me say that I could not review this product completely as it quit working after about 20 scans (30 minutes after charging it for the first time).  I did have the chance to perform scans at 100, 200, 400 dpi as well as in black and white, 12- and 24-bit color.  I was also able to install the software and import about 10 scans into my computer.   It did scan photos well (at both 200 and 400 dpi), but it was tough to get the images to scan in perfectly vertical.  At the higher resolution and higher color (24 bit), the scanning process took to long (about 12 seconds for a full page).  When scanning  at 200 dpi and 12-bit color it took about 8 seconds per page.  Also, the scanner actually turns off after each scan, thus it takes 15-20 seconds and button pushing to reboot the device before scanning another page.  Importing 7 images from the device to my laptop (while it was still working) took about 4 minutes.  The OCR software (Paperport) was good, but the scan quality (Black and white and 100 dpi) was too poor to allow it to be functional.  The 8MB internal memory is not enough and the 128MB or 256MB expansion card is definitely needed. What I was most shocking was the very poor craftsmanship.  There were seams on the device where the plastic was glued.  One of the  two main buttons was recessed into the device.  Also, the indicator lights were misaligned with the overlying symbols.  I cannot emphasize enough how poorly made this was.  I am returning it for a full refund (30 day money back and 90 day exchange - if bought from Planon). DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Addendum (April 20th 2006):  I have had a very difficult time dealing with the Planon company.  To return this product within the first 30 days and get a full refund, you must first get an authorization which required no fewer than 7 phone calls and 5 e-mails.  Once I finally had returned it, they said they had credited my charge when they never did.  Upon calling them they said it would "take some time" to see the credit come through... That was 6 weeks ago.  They do not return phone calls or e-mails and in order to return this it has required alot of time and effort.  There business practices (product quality, customer service, and return policy) are poor at best.  I will re-emphasize: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT 
 I went through an entire box in two days!  The fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly.  Plus, the diameter of these are much smaller than any others.  Try Gerber or Lansinoh 
 This franchise is for fools like all of you who buy it and give it five stars. The songs on this Cd are the reasons of fools who listen to them. Plus, Kelly Clarkson should be lying in a pool of her own blood by now. Music like this is what deserves to die. This franchise will be destroyed by fire and blood, and then the music world will be safe.  Did you think that the song of "Since You've been gone is so good that kids would listen to it? It is music that strikes fear and terror that does the trick. Did you even think that the song of "Incomplete" would be great for kids as well that they should listen to it? I have enough power, that I would use it to destroy the Kids Bop Franchise, and the fools who listen to them. I will create a reign of terror that will destroy MTV, American Idol, Kids Bop, and yes, put the music world under my total control.   To the fools who buy this franchise, as well as the fools who make this franchise.  You are against me. You have tried to rob me of bliss and nourishment, but I have eaten in spite of you, and slept in spite of you. I hereby promote the music duos known as Nox Arcana, and Midnight Syndicate in my reign of terror. There has been one execution, by nightfall there shall be another. For what you did to music by releasing this franchise will never be forgiven. You may lock yourselves away, surround yourselves with security guards, but death is coming. You want music? Nox Arcana and Midnight Syndicate are the forces of music that will rule the radio and television airwaves 
 Terry Pratchett's only written four bad books of which I am aware. This, I suppose, is a sign of genius -- when your work is so consistently good that a small slip-up is so glaringly obvious. It doesn't help Carpe Jugulum, though.  The Witches are the least interesting of Pratchett's sub-worlds, since Granny Weatherwax is simply too confident and sure of herself for us to really believe that anything can threaten her. Her cohorts are simply not as funny or interesting as Death's family, the University Wizards, or the Night Watch.  The storyline here is also something we've seen many times before; something strange and modern is invading the Discworld, and the native forces have to oppose it. In this case, the threat is a bunch of vampires who play by modern rules instead of traditional; they like garlic, they ignore holy symbols, and so forth. The Witches mobilize to oppose them using a combination of clever tricks (which don't really make sense) and blind optimism (basically just hoping something lucky will happen). The subplots involve the arrival of an Omnian revivalist in Lancre, some strange avian life, and a bit more of the fairy-tale cliché from Witches Abroad; none of these subplots actually go anywhere.  Really, this is the exact same plot as Lords and Ladies, but not as well executed. It's still not Pratchett's worst (that's hands-down Fifth Elephant) but it's certainly nearly as much fun to read as his other works 
 The retail price is totally wrong. I could get it for cheaper from another vendor 
 First, let me tell say that I began this book with high hopes since it considered a masterpiece.  However, not 100 pages into the book, I kept asking myself why this book is considered a masterpiece.  After finishing it, I am still asking myself that very question.  I don't have an answer since this book was certainly not worth the time and effort to read it.    I entitled this review "Call me Ahab" since after getting 300 pages into it, I became obsessed with finishing the book. I was not going to let the White Whale beat me. I was not going to let that fish cause me to put down the book (even though that is what I wanted to do). I was not reading this book because I was enjoying it. I merely finished it so that I could say that I finished it and the White Whale did not win.  There is a reason that the most famous line in the book is the first one. Of the 135 chapters, there are maybe 20-25 that are worth the reading.  Of the 725 pages, maybe only 150-200 are worth reading.  I was not too terribly concerned about knowing the anatomy of whales, the different types of whales, the skeletal system of whales, or knowing about whaling in general.    Throughout the book, you may read one chapter with some action only to be followed by 5 or 6 chapters of tangents that are not necessary to understand the story.  This also happens within some of the chapters that have some action.  In the middle of a chapter with some action, Melville may go off on some tangent for several paragraphs and then come back to the storyline.    If you like a story with nonessential information and an author that is entirely to verbose, then this book is for you.  Also, if you have only one book and way too much time on your hands, this would be a good book.  However, if you like a story that has some continuity to it and a good storyline, this is not the book for you.  I think that Melville's plan was to have his writing be the White Whale and the reader as Ahab to determine if his writing would cause the reader to become obsessed just to get through it.  If this was his thinking, then it worked on me.   There are so many more books that are much, much better than this one.  If you have many books that you want to read, read them first and always place this book at the back of the line and read it when you have no other books you would rather read.   Take my advice - read another book. If not, then be prepared to become obsessed with finishing it since that may be the only way you will get though it.  My apologizes to all those that I may have offended with this review 
 I would not recommend this TV......  I purchase the TV   .... It has a brilliant quality picture.    After a couple hours of running four very large segments on the screen went out making it un-viewable.  Panasonics determined the TV needed to be repaired.  After a two week wait the Technician arrived from a local TV repair center.   The Tech recommended that I take the TV back and exchange it for another.  He mentioned this is a common issue with Panasonic's and he has a couple in the shop waiting on parts. HE said I would have to wait several weeks for parts to arrive from Panasonic.   I loaded it up and back it went.   I exchange it for another brand new TV....    With in a week same issue in a different area of the screen.     Long story short in the past three months ....I'm loading up the 4th one tonight to return and try another brand.    I sense from all of the service techs and Panasonic support line this is a common issue....  Nothing I can say I did.  The TV's had very little use.  On Battery Surge/ Monster Cable UPS system, Coax surge filters and in a well ventilated area.  Based on my experience I would say look elsewhere.. 
 This is a wonderful collection of tunes, but it is mastered at a very low level.  I have to crank the volume up to get to typical listening levels.  That just ain't cool; many details in the music are lost.  Re-master this and it's easily five stars 
 I was dissapointed with the patterns, they were all very interesting and the pictures were beautiful but the yarn use for the patterns was ridiculously expensive. I made a pillow and it ended up being $65.  The patterns also had several misakes in them, I made the slippers and the pattern was incorrect, I brought the book into my yarn shop and they said they do NOT recommend the book to newer knitters due to the multiple pattern errors. Great pictures and good for ideas but not great for a newer knitter 
 Sony Premium Grade T-120 VHS Tapes used to be pretty darn good.These days that is not the case.The past few times that I have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish,there have been to many flaws with the tape.One problem has been a line through the middle of the picture,like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about 20 years old,and also there have been jumping pictures,and small audio flaws as well.I use various brands of videotape,so I know that the problem lies here with the Sony videotape.Basically the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and over.They show too much wear way too soon.Get Maxell tapes instead 
 We have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our Ford Windstar van. This cushion did not help 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 This is the book the Pharisees would have written about how they dealt with Jesus...talk about spin.   Paul Pressler and Paige Patterson are the Annas and Caiphas of the twentieth century...they know scripture backwards and forwards, but they completely miss the message of love and grace and forgiveness preached by Jesus Himself 
 This is one of the worst films ever made! And I mean it!! One of the worst scripts I have ever come across. The acting is hammy and the direction is very weak! There was no reason for this movie to exist! "Turbulence" was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels! No way! If you like the 1st mabye try "Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying" but stay away of the 3rd. This is one terrible movie! Believe ME! 
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I was excited to read about a futurist's view on technology and medicine, since I work in biotechnology research for medical applications.  However, the outrageous claims and messianic wild-eyed tone of this book really cranked up my B.S.-meter. Kurzweil's admitting to taking *250* (!) supplements a day both orally and IV was the real clincher.  This guy is neurotic.  He is so afraid of his own death, so blinded by technology and his scientific orgasms, that he fails to take into account the complexity of the human condition, both individually and collectively.  He ignores those facets of being human that don't jibe with his hyper-intellectual, reductionist views.  Human beings evolved to both think AND to feel.  He has reduced human beings to merely thinking machines.  He dreams of a future where we transfer our consciousness to robots, thus shedding the mortal coil of our biological bodies (which he hilariously calls 'version 1.0').  But having a biological body is an intrinsic aspect of being human.  So much of our life revolves around eating, sleeping, dreaming, touching, sex, growing, and so on.  If we give all that up, will we still be human?  What's more, many people don't see death as the end of their consciousness, as they believe in the immortality of the soul.  Kurzweil comes from a very narrow cultural niche, the nerdy materialist/atheist Western technologist.  How many people of the world, from the devout religious folks of Islam and Christianity, to the earth-centered native peoples around the globe and New Agers, will buy into this technolust vision?  Don't hold your breath waiting for 2045 
 This machine worked great!  I used it about five times and was very impressed.  My kids loved it.  But after the fifth time it broke. 
 As an Amazon reviewer, I have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that I have listened to that is worth reviewing. More often than not, I will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who haven't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it. However, I believe I have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it. Chingy never was very talented, whether lyrically or flow-wise, but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use, helping make some of the song more listenable. But his follow-up is...well, how can I describe while also being nice...unmitigated crap. There, I used a big word in an attempt to be nice. Even if you're into the whole "cash-money-hoes" pop rap that's been overtaking the mainstream, this album won't do a thing for you. Some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young "hood" life experiences to make it their own, but Chingy, other than his nasaly, thick accent, does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album. All that this album offers is more generic "I'm rich so I'll flaunt it until you puke" crap. Worse, the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the "music". I don't even know if you can call this music, as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down. Chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise. I can't believe I once even listened to this guy. It makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all. He and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives. And for the love of God, Chingy, LEARN TO SPELL! You're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and "Fall'N". I don't see what's so hard about spelling those right. Here's a short lesson: "WHERE ARE THE GET IT GIRLS?" and "FALLING", My god, you can't even spell simple words right.  Bottom line: there is no reason why you should buy this album. Like I said, even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms, you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once. You'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full CD price for such a worthless waste of materials. For rap that actually warrants more than one listen, try Busdriver or Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow. For good music in general, listen to great metal bands like Children of Bodom and Blind Guardian, and maybe even some classical composers like Dvorak and Beethoven. Those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than Chingy has in his whole body. This CD gets no points whatsoever. I would also give 0 stars to it, but Amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there's at least a shred of quality on it, but this album doesn't even deserve it.  0/1 
 Like his main protege' Diana Ross' book SECRETS OF A SPARROW, I found this autobiography, TO BE LOVED, a bit too self-flattering and unapologetic.    Berry Gordy's story is extremely fascinating, his accomplishments in, and contributions to, American music are absolutely gargantuan. He deserves a great deal of credit for having created the conditions for an unmatched musical legacy to flourish.   The lore surrounding the founding and early development of his great musical empire is almost as wonderful and engaging as the music itelf. You DO get some of that here.   Gordy also explains many of his business decisions. From most accounts, Mr. Gordy and his family were astute business people.  However, Gordy's single-mindedness could often cause him to ignore or underplay some of the artist's gifts, appeal and marketability.  For example, great as Diana Ross' star potential was, other female artists, even within the Supremes, were not as fully developed as they deserved to be, while Diana was given "special" opportunities in the way of extraordinary classes [beyond Motown's famous Artist Development]in modeling, etc.  Was this purely a "business" decision?  In the meantime, artists such as Kim Weston and Brenda Holloway, both quite gifted vocally, and very attractive physically, basically languished at the label.    Gladys Knight and The Pips, while having had moderate success at Motown, but not given that "extra push," absolutely exploded after they left the label, had huge sales, and were awarded several Grammy awards.   The Spinners fared even worse at Motown.  But after they left the label they had phenomenal success in the early-mid seventies with singles and album sales. Many of those singles are considered r&b classics.   Was there just too much talent at Motown for all of it to be promoted as deserved?  Was Mr. Gordy too hands-on during those years?   I wasn't satisfied with Mr. Gordy's take on some of these situations.  As a huge Supremes' fan, I was especially dissatisfied with his matter-of-fact comment that, within the original group, Diana had the "sparkle," and Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard didn't, to paraphrase.  People loved all 3 Supremes, and us fans recognized the magic and potential in all three. The fate of Florence Ballard is especially sad.  She was dead [of a broken heart?] at age 32, just about 9 years after her ousting from that group.  Her replacement within the Supremes was literally waiting in the wings to take over, between the early evening and later performance at a Las Vegas casino in July, 1967, when Flo was fired from the group. Was this also, a purely business decision?  Was Mr. Gordy willing to hear Flo's grievances about being relegated more and more to the background, when the fans loved her to be featured, and by many accounts, she was the "founder" of the group?  I really prefer Mary Wilson's unvarnished take on the Supremes' story, as presented in her wonderful books DREAMGIRL and SUPREME FAITH [both available in one volume].  She tells it like it is, and, along the way, exposes her own warts and blemishes, but also comes across as a rounded, real, fallible, wonderful person.  TO BE LOVED didn't have nearly enough of that.  DREAMGIRL sold like hotcakes, while Mr. Gordy's book did rather poorly.  Ms. Ross' book also sold poorly.  A lesson??? If you're going to do a memoir, people will really relate more the more real you relate.  
 The book starts off with a terrific survival tale of an English ship full of Australian bound captives, suddenly discovering that they are way off course due to a terrible storm. What follows is a 70 page tale of death, despair, deceit, and survival.   After that, the book is ruined by the prototypical Dirk Pitt saga. There's some monstrous, megalomaniac with some diabolical scheme. However, the nauseating Dirk Pitt comes to the rescue (surprise, surprise), and saves the day using ludicrous and ridiculous tactics.   And of course, there's tons of boring filler. Large chunks of it are filled with people having their tongue in Pitt's ear, praising his every move.   Don't bother, if you've read a Dirk Pitt novel before. Nothing new here, besides the prelude. 
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 This book is a horrific let down.  While admittedly no one expects to it be the next Lord of the Rings, I have rarely read a novel as poorly written and unbelievable as this.  I found the entire book felt like it was written by a grade 9 student.  Medically, it was accurate, but english wise, it was atrocious.  While reading this, I felt like it was a glorified Nancy Drew books, you know, the ones we all loved when we were 6 or 7 years old.  the characters are superficial and unbelieavle, the scenerios and plot are even more artificial.  The character of Tony is one of the most unrealistic fictional characters I have ever come across.  It was pretty obvious the author knew absolutely zip about organized crime when he wrote this book.  Overal, a very poorly written and unbelievable book.  No one is expecting Shakespeare, but we're at least hopeing for some entertainment.  This was painful to read 
 It just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover, or it's title for that matter. This book is just awful. Awful. Bukowski wasn't a Beat, he didn't hang with the Beats and he had nothing in common with the Beats. This book struggles through it's 255 "pages" attempting to find any connection, regardless how tenuous, linking Buk to the Beats. It is like saying "Lawrence Welk and the Beatles". They only thing they have in common is that they lived at the same time and made music: Buk lived at the same time as the Beats and they both wrote. There are two separate stories going on here: one about the life of Bukowski and the other is a history of the Beat movement and there is no coherent thought connecting the two. The book is heavily referenced and quoted with a complete lack of original thought. It is so flimsy that the author had to include a 61 page interview with Bukowski and a 61 page notes section just to get the book to a reasonable page length. The interview is also terrible, after reading it one has to ask 'Is Ham on Rye the only book by Buk that Duval ever read?' The actual discussion of Bukowski and the Beats is limited to a weak 118 pages. The whole thing reads like a bad high school term paper. Save your time and your money, skip this one. Go watch grass grow, it would be more interesting 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 This book was a requirement for my directing class and I must say it did not help me at all.  The title is misleading suggesting that a reader actually gets advice on how to prepare for directing.  Instead, readers get Bogart's theory on what theater directing is.   The book gives aspiring directors a confidence boost where Bogart basically says, "you can do it, just be persistent and brave."  If anyone wants to get a book that gives a better description of what directing entails, the best bet is to get the book, A Sense of Direction, written by William Ball 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 This is a fascinating book, but the title is misleading. "All Night Party" suggests a sexy, scandalous tell-all book about the Twenties -- full of long-legged blonde flappers dancing on table tops and swigging from flasks, and gangsters piling up loot, and sexy black jazz men blowing their trumpets all night long.   In reality, most of the women Barnet writes about were lesbians who disliked men, and parties, and had little interaction with the wilder, sillier, more entertaining aspects of Prohibition. Many of these women "acted out" and abused drugs and alcohol, but you don't get a sense of pleasure or reckless abandon, more  a sad case of personal demons destroying talent from within.   Barnet never resolves the contradiction here. A Twenties girl might bob her hair, swig liquor from a flask, dance on table tops -- and still fall into a proper marriage with a boy from her own class. Pleasure and excitement don't always lead to rebellion and non-conformity. By the same token, a lesbian artist might live alone in a gloomy flat and paint beautiful paintings, but not get any pleasure out of her solitary life. Pleasure is not political, and rebels are not always happy in their rebellion. Barnet tends to confuse the issue and sentimentalize both the flappers and the feminists, as if the two were one in the same.   In reality, the same girls who danced on table tops in the Twenties were often the ones most likely to express bigoted and reactionary views in later life. Case in point, Margaret Mitchell, a Southern girl who went to Smith college. She lived the Flapper lifestyle to the fullest, by her own admission, and went on to write GONE WITH THE WIND -- full of prurient sexual titillation, to be sure, but also a virtual dictionary of racial hatred and lies. Nothing vicious little southerner Peggy Mitchell learned at Yankee Smith College prevented her from becoming a passsionate cheerleader for the Ku Klux Klan. Privilege and education are not a vaccination against hate. But this is one reality modern feminists are desperate not to recognize, because most of them still come from fancy white girl "finishing schools" like Smith and Barnard.    By the same token, Barnet keeps insisting that parties and clubs in Greenwich Village and Harlem were "interacial" in the Twenties. Maybe so, but she doesn't explore the problem fully. Certainly one can imagine a pretty blonde flapper eyeing a black trumpet player in Harlem with innocent admiration. But if the two of them got together, wouldn't the reaction of the black women of the time be one of rage and humiliation? Barnet remains discreetly silent on this issue. By the same token, a rich young college man could easily manage an affair with a high-yellow gal at the Cotton Club -- but his wife would certainly turn out to be a blue-eyed blonde. So what was the All Night Party really worth? Who was really celebrating, and why? 
 We bought this game yesterday for our daughter.  The dolls are very difficult for her to dress.  We have to do it for her.  Also, two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times.  She loves the game and the princesses, and it does teach memory, but it could be made much better. 
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 At first I was very intrigued by this author and his narrative.  The story seemed to have a lot to offer.  But the problem we all have when reading spiritual books is how to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Someone who had done their homework, could undoubtedly, read the literature and put together their own book.  What really separates true experiences from imagination?  And what good is imagination in achieving greater a spiritual connection with the universe?  For me, the deciding factor is, whether or not the work speaks to me.  I set the book down for a few days and meditated on the contents.  As I reviewed the book and it's themes, I am sorry to say, I think it is more likely a scientific reduction of the shamanic experience to an agenda of fighting global warming 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 	I can recommend this book only to a person who is interested in thirty or so particular families that settled in the vicinity of what is now Lewistown, Montana, during the last two decades of the nineteenth century.  There are better choices for people interested in the history of the Metis people or Montana.  	Defining who the Metis people are is a fundamental problem for all historians.  This book attempts a definition, but fails.  The title of the book implies that the Metis can identify who belongs and who doesn't.  Such unity is beyond the capability of humans.  The word Metis is French and can be translated as "mixed blood."  In a very narrow sense, one might think of the offspring from intermarriage between the French and Indians (mostly Cree) of eastern Canada during the early days of the fur trade.  This concept breaks down rapidly as other races enter the mix.  After devoting most of this book to treating the Metis as a separate ethnic group, Foster nearly cancels it all out in her concluding chapter when she says:  "In families that might have Cree, Chippewa, or other tribal relatives plus a variety of Euro-American relatives and in-laws, a Metis identity might be the only one inclusive enough to encompass and accept all members of the family....  In the 1800s a Metis person may have had ancestors who were Chippewa, Cree, African, Iroquois, English, Scot, French, and Hawaiian, as well as a number of other Native and European ancestries.  By the early twentieth century, Metis families may have included all of these plus Lithuanian, Polish, Croatian, or any other of the numerous ethnic groups who settled in central Montana at the turn of the century."  	In general, Metis identity requires a mix of both white and Indian heritage.  There are two aspects of being a product of two ethnic groups.  First, you can be either one or both.  Second, you can be neither.  This can be an advantage, or a great disadvantage.  Sometimes the Metis could convince government officials that they were sufficiently Indian to get land allotments on the reservations; sometimes the government excluded them.  Sometimes the Indian groups to which the Metis were related accepted them as part of the tribe; and sometimes they excluded the Metis.  Indians were not able to become American citizens during the historical period considered by this book.  However, if the Metis individuals were not Indian, they could possibly become American citizens; voting and homesteading as other citizens did.  	There was another duality that influenced the lives of many Metis, Indians, and others.  During the 1800s, the Metis were buffalo hunters and frequently crossed the forty-ninth parallel that later became the line between the United States and Canada.  Thus, a family could well show that they had resided in either country and that some of their children were born on Canadian soil and some on U.S. soil.  In fact, they might not even know in what country the child was born.  This became a problem as each of the two countries decided who might enjoy the rights of citizens.  	Foster never reveals whether or not she is Metis.  If so, I doubt if she grew up in a Montana Metis community.  This book is drawn from Ph.D. material.  It reads as if an outsider is basing conclusions on research and interviews.  Most of the material is consistent with the historical facts of the time.  However, it seems out of context with the broad history of Montana and the lifestyles of Montana people in the past century and a half.  To give an example, Foster implies that the Metis and Indians were somehow uniquely disadvantaged by the extermination of the buffalo and the separation of Canada and the U.S. by the forty-ninth parallel.  However, there were many fur traders, wolfers, and others who faced the same problems.  There are many first person accounts by people who lived close to the border and encountered obstacles or prejudice when crossing for social or business reasons.  As drought or homesteading curtailed their livelihood, many Montana homesteaders and cowboys faced difficulties very similar to those that Foster sees as resulting from prejudice against the Metis.  	In fact, this book goes overboard on showing that the Metis suffered prejudice from the Euro-American community.  Indeed, the Metis and Indians suffered prejudice.  However, many of the factors Foster cites as evidence were broadly true across Montana at the time.  I grew up in southeastern Montana.  The majority of farmers and ranchers could have made a case that the townspeople were prejudiced against them, that the bankers and merchants didn't treat them fairly, that they lost homes because their lifestyle was inconsistent with the homestead requirements.  Some felt treated unequally because of differences in religion or politics.  Quite a few felt discriminated against because of deficiencies in language or education.  Without looking very deep, a person can find books about many Montana ethnic groups, each claiming prejudice against their particular group; Italian, German, Polish, Chinese, Irish, Scandinavian, sheep men, wolfers, homesteaders, newly arrived immigrants, old cowboys, schoolteachers.  The list is virtually endless.  Admittedly, the prejudice against these groups was in most cases less than that experienced by the Metis.  On the other hand, most people would feel that Montana Indians faced greater discrimination than the Metis, even those Metis that chose to identify themselves as Indian.  However, it is difficult to quantify degrees of prejudice.  	"We Know Who We Are" is difficult to read.  It is at an academic level and retains the character of a thesis.  There are copious references, a large percentage of which are unavailable to the average reader.  This review started by saying that there are better sources for the reader interested in Metis history.  That is true, but unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good source.  	In closing, it should be noted that the issues concerning Metis are not all historical.  In each recent session of the U.S. Congress, there have been bills concerning what is often termed Montana's Landless Indians.  A significant portion of this group is what Foster identifies as Metis 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 Reading this book I couldn't suppress a suspicions that this book was written for PR purposes. The people who wrote it are, undoubtedly, very knowledgeable in their area - i.e. the oil industry, but still... Many pages are dedicated to how the US government had been trying to put a straitjacket on the oil industry. Another theme is inefficiency and greed of oil-producing countries. The only `sacred cow' in the book is The Big oil, and unfortunately it is excluded form meaningful critical analysis. From my perspective, the book's goal is make you feel good about oil industry. It is a good book for that purpose. Unfortunately, although it presents some tidbits of really curios information, this book is essentially shallow. I would recommend it for a college student who wants to join oil industry, but isn't sure. This book would cement his or her decision. But if you seek a truly good book on the subject go for 'The Prize' by Daniel Yergin. I am reading it now and I believe it is more balanced and simply more interesting 
 The worst anthology of maps I have ever encountered, lacking depth or a point of view, and with no historical or cartographic intelligence. How can you reveal anything about a place ot a culture with two maps? How can you pretend to say anything about Rome or its cartographic history without Nolli's 1748 masterpiece? A ridiculous effort 
 This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other.  I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace.  Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner.  I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it.  I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better 
 The picture is perfect.  Why can't the Laurel and Hardy series be so good, especially their silents, which look just hideous, even in the Hallmark releases.  BUT, the music for the General is SO BAD I can't get through it.  I don't know what kind of organ or synthesizer they use, but the new-age sound certainly does NOT suit the 1920s.  The music just plods along without humour, and very little contrast.  I have seen these films with live accompaniment, and with great music, the comedy just comes alive; but with anything less than great, the film falls flat and seems at best droll, at worst just kind of stupid.  Very, VERY BAD.  But one thing this proves, movies even back to the middle 1920s are clean, clear, and sharp.  Never accept less than that in your collection!  And send companies letters demanding it 
 The Bourne Identity by this author was great but this is a contrived, monumental bore.  Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention.  This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest.  OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make.  The world presented here is sick, but the sickness is the author's monomania 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 My husband bought this for me because I believe in the use of herbs and he thought it would be helpful to have a Christian perspective.  I did appreciate the explanation for the Biblical use of pharmeceuticals.  However, as far as a guide for herbs goes, it left me much confused. It is strangely setup like a jeapordy game which is not easy reference. It contains a lot of information on a handful of herbs, but it is certainly not informative on all the herbs.  The author leaves you with the conclusion that basically most of the herbs have not been tested thoroughly and may not help the way that some people claim.  After reading it, I felt like I had probably wasted hundreds of dollars on herbs.  
 This mouse works fine on my laptop...however, it goes through a pack of batteries within weeks.  I hate it.  If I still had the packaging for this mouse, I would have returned it.  No wonder it is so cheap. 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 If you want to see what Rick Warren believes, read Saddleback Church's Statement of Faith.  There are no hidden agendas.  I doubt you'll find Rick Warren is the anti-Christ, leading the church astray.  If you want a more balanced view of the "controversy" then pick up a copy of "Rick Warren And The Purpose That Drives Him" ISBN: 0736917381.   This author's analysis is based on the assumption that Rick Warren is influenced by the New Age movement.  This is so far removed from what is actually happening in Rick Warren's ministry, that Smith's assumptions don't hold water.    Is this the fundamentalist method of spreading the Gospel?  Using fear and intimidation to win followers?  I don't know.  Just double check the facts, and you'll uncover the truth.  I don't believe the facts are in this book.  We all fall short, that is why we need God's saving grace.  Always double check what people teach with the bible, and pray for guidance.  Let God be your guide 
 Come and hear Sunset Boulevard songs slaughtered - 2 mega big songs crying out for the Big Voice and Big Orchestra and she goes and undersings them with plinky plonky piano as the only background. Streisand's versions wipe  the floor with her. She's not even close. This style fits very  uncomfortably with the rest of the album which on the whole is  unlistenable. Only Come On Come On has any true grace or prescence. AVOID 
 Very disappointed, this item never got shipped to me, we waited close to 2 months to find out it wasn't coming 
 I understand that the most recent thing is to take groups of one band or artist's songs and make a musical (Movin' Out; Taboo; Mamma Mia) but this takes a small group of songs from the 60's and makes a musical. Maybe if you saw the show it would make more sense, but the CD gives nothing as to the plot, or characters. This is not a Broadway CD, it's a 60's Ballad CD. Don't get me wrong, the voices and music are great, but to be advertised as anything resembling a musical is just plain wrong. Musical Theater collectors can pass on this one (that is the first time I've ever said that) it shouldn't be part of a musical collection. But if you like the golden oldies by all means get this one. I didn't give this CD two stars because it's bad, it is just advertised wrong and shouldn't be here.  Favorite song: "Goin Back 
 An excellent idea, with a fatally flawed implementation.  It appears to be a limitation of the midi controller - drums will fail to sound intermittantly.<br /> <br /> An except from my (so far unanswered) request for support from Ion-Audio.com:<br /> <br /> I have found a problem with my new Ion IED05 Electronic Drum Set - the drums appear to conflict, perhaps in the MIDI interface, perhaps within the Alesis controller. <br /> <br /> When playing the drums, a pad will fail to sound intermittantly (and occasionally, the whole system will mute momentarily).<br /> <br /> I hope this isn't the first you've heard of this issue, and that a fix is available.<br /> <br /> Of course, I've checked the connections, checked to be sure I'm hitting the pads squarely and in the center, tried swapping pads (though the issue affects all of them, not just the snare), etc.  <br /> <br /> If fact, I can often reproduce the problem by simply, repeatedly striking any two pads together, one a split-second after the other.  When it happens, the second appears to mute the first, before the first fully produces a tone.<br /> ________________________<br /> <br /> Until/unless this issue's resolved, you'll find the set a cause of repeated frustration, whether for learning, practice or performance 
  Lots of interesting explanations. Poor pictures. Total lack of detail to make room for quantity. Cute but no big deal. To the point of boring 
 I decided to buy this book instead of borrowing from the library because of the pretty colorful pictures it has. However, I regret spending $100 on this book because the text is poorly orgnanized. Although some chapters are written well, you will see content are scrambled within some chapters making it hard to take notes. There are also errors like they mentioned that Th cell help cellular response, but they ever tell you how. The activation gate and inactivation gate mentioned in the neuron chapters are confusing. The mentioned it on the text, but they don't show it on the pictures.   I need to admit that their animation, tutorial in their web site are awesome.   I would recommed the campbell book instead 
 ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman Review by Nickolas Cook  	For those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling ï¿½lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition.  With "Anansi Boys" he again proves all of those qualities and more. 'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, "American Gods"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death.  'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human.  And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider.  Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fiancï¿½ right out from under him. Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human.  But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self.  For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother.  He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death. Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace.  There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven. "Anansi Boys" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of "American Gods" and the extraordinary "Neverwhere", but fits nicely along side his "Stardust".  It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by  some of his other fiction.  --Nickolas Cook 
 Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D 
 This book may work if you are a new teacher with no resources and no ideas.  If you are a veteran teacher, don't bother.  The book is full of worksheets that you could quickly create and are probably already doing in your classroom.  Don't waste your money 
 I find it impossible to trust any would-be interpreter of Jane Austen who, in her analysis of Pride & Prejudice, writes the line: "Her [Mrs. Bennet's] restored faith that Lydia and Wickham will turn out very well is wonderfully brought to pass".   This is easily my least favorite among the seven or so biographies that I have read; I was particularly disappointed after marvelous beginning that Tomalin made in describing Jane's birth and earliest life.   I made myself read it a second time in order to be fair.   I am left with the feeling that while Tomalin genuinely admires Jane Austen, she has considerably more pity for her life than sympathy for her point of view.   Ms. Tomalin places a great emphasis on the importance of passion and enthusiasm that I doubt Austen so uncritically shared.  Indeed, Ms. Tomalin has to interchange JA's heroes and villains in order to come up with interpretations of the book that please her, and in several cases, insist that JA got things wrong in her epilogues.   This leads to some odd juxtapositions that fit right in with Tomalin's somewhat overwrought thinking.  Tomalin cannot accept that Marianne could move on and love Colonel Brandon, but she is also upset that Cassandra Austen spent the rest of her life mourning her dead fiance.  Isn't perpetual mourning for a lost love be what Tomalin would have Marianne doing, given that Willoughby married someone else?  Consistently inconsistent, Tomalin lambastes Fanny Price for declining to marry someone that she doesn't love (or like or trust), at least while there her true love remains available.  Tomalin is apparently one of those who feel that it is not enough of an achievement for Austen to be one of the very few authors who, after two hundred years, remain both critical and popular successes.  No, she wants to convert JA to a heroine suitable for the late 20th century.  This is particularly ironic since she faults the Victorians for their attempts to remake JA in their own image.  She attempts, failing dismally in my case, to convince us that JA had an eventful life.  She turns to posthumous psychoanalysis for this, interpreting eventful as traumatic and finding psychic wounds from the Austens' childrearing techniques.  The book rapidly takes on a whiny quality that I found tedious and annoying.  I comment on this being 52, having been born in 1953.  As such, I can remember when "experts had proven" that the child is born a blank slate through the present day when parents are held to have little effect on their children's psychological development except for the responsibility to keep them alive and healthy.  I am also well aware that "expert" child-rearing advice has changed over the centuries, some eras recommend techniques that in other eras were considered certain to produce psychopaths.  (readers might want to read Sarah Hrdy's Mother Nature or Stephen Pinker's The Blank Slate).   While my own tastes in childrearing certainly would align more with Tomalin's, I find it foolish and irritating for her to excoriate Mrs. Austen for raising their children according to the accepted pattern of their day.   (And for all that Tomalin may bring in feminist interpretation, she is clearly engaging in mother-blaming here: all decisions that she doesn't like are charged to Mrs. Austen.) While her arguments of how this affected JA may seem logical, does it make sense when considering that so many other people of the time shared similar experiences?   The reader may want to read Elizabeth Jenkin's arguments in her 1938 book that Jane Austen was in fact writing through most of her "years of silence", as well as David Nokes arguments in his 1997 biography that Jane was having too good a time to write as much, before accepting Tomalin's explanation of Jane as falling into a severe depression after a repetition of childhood trauma.   I think in her efforts to make JA into a martyr, Tomalin slights her as a social critic.  She also fails to fully appreciate the problems of dependent daughters in interlocked families, the tension between wanting and needing family unity and the desire for personal autonomy.   I have no doubt that JA keenly felt and resented the disadvantages imposed upon her as a younger unmarried daughter, but this is not a unique problem imposed by her particular family.  The conventions of the time meant that Jane and Cassandra really were financial drains on their family: their society had failed to make any accomodation to the realities of making women financially dependent but expecting companiate marriages.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the popularity of JA derives from her attention to this double-bind that so many of her female readers shared.    Tomalin sees the effect only on Jane, not on her other family members.  I can sympathize with JA's distress at leaving Steventon, but surely her 72-year old father was entitled to retire?  Her parents spent decades in Hampshire whether they liked it or not because that is where Rev. George Austen's living was - didn't they have as much right to live somewhere else for a change as Jane had stay where she was? Tomalin faults James for not offering his sisters a home independent of his mother; I presume that Jane could have asserted her wishes on the basis of he offer to house all three women, but, independent of Jane's dislike for James' wife Mary, how practical would that have been?  If Jane has lived with James, would Cassandra have been with her or with their mother?  At that time, given their resources, it may have been impossible for Mrs. Austen and her daughters to independently pursue the course that each preferred.   Several solutions suggest themselves, but they all involve Mrs. Austen living as a dependent relation or the brothers Austen coming up with a lot more money.  Tomalin also by this makes JA something of a hothouse flower.  Tomalin makes a point of mentioning servants, but in a somewhat contradictory fashion is arguing that Jane's family should have understood her genius and supported her in the leisured style to which she was somewhat, and would have like to have been even more accustomed.   I would have liked that myself.  How many people have the luxury of choosing quiet or excitement and work or leisure just as they choose?   If JA had lived today, would she have been able to write it she had also been required to earn her own living?  Tomalin has done some wonderful research on peripheral matters such as Austen's neighbors that anyone who is very interested in Austen or her period should find very interesting.  Indeed, has this been written as a book on the associates of the Austens, I would probably have given it 5-stars as long as Tomalin left out her psychologizing.  This includes much more about Jane's cousin and sister-in-law Eliza Hancock than is warranted by her importance in the author's life.  It is very interesting, and I am happy to read it, but it does remain that the real biographical information on JA herself is somewhat scanty compared to other biographies of this length.  I would not recommend this as either a first or only biography.  My own recommendations for biographies so far are Carol Shields (short), Valerie Grosvenor Myers' Obstinate Heart (moderate length, seriously flawed by a lack of notes), and John Halperin (long).  Elizabeth Jenkins' is considered a classic biography, but it can be difficult to get and doesn't strike me as worth the trouble given the other material now available.  The notes are beautifully done so that it is easy to match the note with the citation in the text.  There are also useful family trees and a map of the Hampshire neighborhood of the Austens.  I cannot begin to guess what the logic for arranging the bibliography was 
 This book is a glorified version of everyday common sense. It is full of "insightful" tips like 'Check your child's backpack and schoolwork each night' and 'A child who has a fever, upset stomach, flu or severe cold or cough should be kept home from school.' Gee, why didn't I think of that! If you need a book to tell you these and other "insider" tips then you need more help than this book could possibly give you! I bought this book because I was looking for homework and test taking tips for my second grader. I was very disappointed 
 First the good points:  This book is quite well-written, and an excellent overview of many competing "therapies" for autistic children.  Both myself and my sister have worked extensively with autistic children, and we have family members who suffer from both autism and Asperger's syndrome.  But....  This book is EXTREMELY biased--and sadly, not altogether true.  The Lovaas method is praised as "recovering" children from autism, and though Mrs. Maurice repeatedly states that her children are "recovered," from the evidence she herself provides, it's fairly clear her children were not "autistic" to begin with.  It seems that while her daughter may have had some mild-to-moderate form of developmental disorder, she was obviously not autistic (and the idea that her daughter "recovered" in a matter of mere months is ludicrous).  Even sillier is the story of her youngest son, who does not seem to have developed any indications of autism beyond being a late talker.  It seems as if Mrs. Maurice found doctors who told her what she wanted to hear, and then became obssesed with "recovering" her children.  Clearly her daughter benefitted from the early intervention, but Maurice's story lacks credibility.  For those who have children with true autism, Mrs. Maurice's story of a "miracle cure" will prove more devastating than encouraging.  (A particularly tragic story of a woman named "Lucille" is appended to the book, who upended her family's life to enroll her autistic son in a Lovaas-based program--partly on Maurice's advice--and whose son has so far made little progress).  There are autistic children who do become very high-functioning, even mainstreamed, but deficits remain.  That Maurice's children "recovered" so fully and rapidly is proof that they were never autistic to begin with.  At her interview with her child's behavioral therapist, she states decisively, "Anne-Marie IS going to recover."  Of course--since she'd already decided in her mind that her daughter was autistic, it was easy enough to then declare her "recovered" a few months later.  Maurice seems not to understand that autism is a "spectrum" disorder, and she accepts as faith that it is a completely neurological disorder.  Much like depression, autism can have either biological or psychological causes, and the root cause is not always so clear.  At one point she notes "Failed bonding is a result of autism, not the cause"--but again, this isn't always true.  Even more biased is her presentation of the various alternative therapies for autism.  She rejects all medication therapy; various nutritional approaches (such as those for food allergies and Vitamin B) are briefly raised and then dismissed.  Her extreme prejudice towards holding therapy belies her own statement that she believe it to have some "real" if "limited" worth.  She paints Dr. Martha Welch as a dangerous flake, a gross libel.  Dr. Welch may well have been a bit New-Agey for her tastes, but I have seen children benefit enormously from it.    Even more dishonestly, she viciously pans Virginia Axline's seminal "play therapy," which has stood the test of time and which, again, I have personally seen the benefits of.  It is true that behavioral therapy has an excellent track record in terms of helping children become higher-functioning, but no one therapy is a "magic bullet."  In my experience, children benefit from an integrated program which includes behavioral, speech, play, and nutritional therapy (and very often also medication, though the author does not explain her animosity toward it.)    Lastly, though I am not indicting the author for being rich, she blithely ignores the fact that the average parents (not working on a Wall Street, not a nonworking wife who has a full-time nanny anyway, not living in a fancy Manhattan prewar co-op, etc.) cannot afford to have this type of intensive treatment brought into their homes, and must instead become advocates for their children within the local school system.  Maurice does supply some valuable information on the appeals process with schools  and HMOs.  But if you are the parent of an autistic child, think again before reading this book.  It will likely hurt your feelings, and what good information it provides is readily available elsewhere.      
 Normally my opinion about books is quite digital - eighter good or bad, nothing between. In this case I make an exception. On the one hand some pieces of the plot, some character descriptions and interactions are fun to read and to follow along. On the other hand there's a lot that I don't like too. To start with - all male figures are eighter downright criminal or at least loosers in life - drinkers, dopers, you name it. Most of them, including the main hero, are incredibly brutal in a totaly unbelievable way. On the other hand - all females eighter die early from lots of bad luck, cancer, whatever or they are nearly faultless in everything. Frankly, I find this man-bashing style in books more and more annoying. Then of course the murderer becomes obvious after about the first third of the book and all the developments are very easy to anticipate. Also everything is to the maximum melodramatic. In many cases I had to lough about silly descriptions of things. The book really lives from a lot of knowledge about tornados and the surrounding science and from some good descriptions of parts of Oklahoma. Now here I read that the facts about those two things are wrong ... hmm, doesn't change the reading quality. I don't know - I don't regret reading it, but .. 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 First of all, this book is riddled with errors.  There are typos up the wazoo!  Second, a lot of the optical path diagrams of the instruments are very confusing.  You cannot make heads or tales from the illustrations.  Skoog has yet to enter the 21st century because everything is in black and white.  The picture style is very bland and terribly out of date.  Skoog also tries desperately to be pedantic.  For example, he describes a computer monitor as a cathode ray tube output device.  If you like Atkins, you will love Skoog, or vice versa.  It's great as a reference but otherwise worthless.  Trust me when I say this book is too wordy, too confusing, and way too 'Cold War' era boring 
 Pearl Jam used to be good, now they're just a joke and this DVD shows it. Do not buy this its awful. They were great until after 1998 
 The book had so much promise, but I find it to be disappointing in several ways, alas.  The recipes I've tried have been delicious, and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative, although the discussions and instructions don't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool, as would, for example, anything by Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, Jacques Pepin, or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks, all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes.  In this case, I was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before I bought the book.  Were I a tyro, I don't think this book would be the best introduction, although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying.  My biggest disappointment, though, is the organization of the book:  ice cream recipes are "bundled" with their accompanying cookies, garnishes, and the like; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream, for example, we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches, with ice cream of any of several different flavor families.  One has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find, say, recipes for chocolate ice cream.  I would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes, by flavor and page number, right up front -- I don't want to spend so much time looking for the flavor I want.    My next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color.  My middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book, even with my reading glasses on, and I surely can't prop the book 18-20" back from my utensils, to read as I work without changing position, as I like to do with my cookbooks.  This is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen (admittedly very attractive) style over function.  The book IS very attractive, and the photographs are lovely -- but I would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being able to read the recipes and discussions more easily.  My final disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of most of the "dessert packages," for lack of a better word.  Making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is, in most cases, a tremendously labor-intensive exercise.  I have opted for using some of the creative and delicious ice cream recipes and figuring out my own much simpler and easier garnishes and accompaniments.  I work a demanding job and have a house to run.  I love to cook, but can't devote as much time to making an ice cream sandwich, for example, as these recipes require.  So I use less of the book than I'd wish.  Over all, Ms. Luchetti's sense of style and taste are impressive, and she seems superbly knowledgeable about frozen desserts.  And many of the ice cream recipes are lovely.  But I had hoped that this would be a book I would pull from the shelf much more often than I will, in fact, because the book is so difficult to use 
 WOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THIS!!!!!!!!!!! That is unbelievable. I would seriously be just as embarrassed to be caught anywhere near this as I would with a Barney DVD. Im serious, I kinda cant help but think tyheres something wrong with the teens that listen to this stuff. i meen I guess I understand if your a teenage girl or something, but I can't imagine why a male older than the age of 11 would listen to this? Look this isn't an insult, its a cry for help.   
 This is not the fault of Amazon or even the product. I wasused to a gym quality rower (conceptII) which allows a lot of resistance.  The Integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance.  I am in the process of sending it back.  The machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge.  An expensive lesson 
 When I go to a book that gives details about an Operating System, I expect more than I can find in the built in help.  This book contained too many errors, was incomplete in areas that most people would be looking for, and is in my opinion a waste of not only money, but time.  I deserve a refund for this.  Stick to Mark Minasi for titles like this, you will rarely be disappointed 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.   
 I thought this hot air brush would make things easier by not having to hold a round brush and blow dryer. It's a great idea, but it just doesn't work as well as that.   First let me say I have shoulder length, normal hair, but a lot of it. If I air dry, it is slightly wavy. I used the larger of the two brushes and found it couldn't get through my hair. So then I was using a second hand to try to push the hair against the brush so it would curl around it. That didn't work very well, and I wound up burning my hands more than once. I also found that I couldn't get the same nice curl with this hot air brush that I could get by using a regular round brush and dryer.   The other major problem was that the brush got extremely hot. If you have an idea that you'll be able to change from the larger brush size to smaller (or the unit without the attachment) or vice versa, you won't without getting burned. The attachment--even the end of the blow dryer itself--is simply too hot to touch. I was doing things like using a hand towel to try to change attachments.   The size and shape of the unit is also not optimal. I found it too large and awkward to use. The off button is located right where your hand is, so it's easy to bump. Also, there's no cold shot. If you've come to appreciate what that can do for setting a curl, you'll probably miss it like I did.   Additionally, as another person has mentioned, the unit is very loud. You would be wise to buy a couple foam ear plugs if you are determined to keep this brush and keep your hearing. I don't believe I read any warning about the noise, either. It's much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer.   Time wise, I found that I spent much longer trying to get my hair dry, and then I wasn't fully satisfied with the style as well as the burns and hassle involved in getting there. I gave this a try for a few days and then returned it to the store for a refund. It made me appreciate the traditional blow dryer and round brush. Some things are just not as good as they seem. 
 this book has too many distracting pictures, it comes across as a childrens book.  The book is informative but needs some profesional work done to it.  If you dont mind a picture book to learn about digestive problems, than this book is for you 
 In Dr Yang's DVD I expected to find a good reference for my practice of the Yang 108 form, but I am very displeased with the quality of the DVD. For the price that I paid, I expected a least good video quality. When Dr. Yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor; there are close ups of the upper body and obviously, the movement of the legs is not seen; you get lost with changes of camera angles; at some point, you can see people in the background; and the stage is not properly set up. Also, and with all due respect, his movements are weird. I have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the Yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed. Definitively I do not recommend this DVD to any one who wants to use it as a reference, you can use it as a movie 
 Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff. Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old.  PS the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs Amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer 
 Way too much unusable information.  I kept waking up throughout the book, hoping to get to the parts about day-trading I could put into practice.  (It never happened 
 This CD is horrible. Don't buy this CD, you might think oh playboy mansion party COOL!, you're dead wrong, this cd is horrible, it might be good if you're on serious [intoxication], in which case you would love this CD it would feel like God rubbing your belly. I was thoroughly disappointed, amazon will probably filter out this this review because it is saying how horrible the item REALLY is, as opposed to those fake reviews they posted 
 This book has a great story to tell, but through the stalling and back-telling the powerfulness of the message is lost.  I found that I had to force myself to finish hoping to be swept away by the ending, but was instead left wondering what I had missed.  The narrative is confusing and lacks any passion on the subject at hand.  However I believe this could be an intriguing movie 
 We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients.  We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work.  Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature.  Some of the pages were blank, having not even been printed.  I figure the book was a total loss of money spent 
 From its boring title to its cast of cliched southern rednecks, the Empty Chair disappoints from the very beginning.  The storyline about a teen killer/kidnapper obsessed with insects is interesting, but the story quickly dissolves into a half-baked tale of southern intrigue that never offers any excitement.  Deaver tried to save the book by pulling about a dozen rabbits out of a hat near the end of the novel, but many of these surprises and plot twists make no sense at all, and after the third or fourth one, the reader just gets tired of the whole thing.  Deaver also tries to wrap up every plot conflict with a neat little bow at the end, but he leaves out most of the explanations which only leaves readers scratching their heads and wondering what happened.  Try the earlier books in this series, both of which were far better reads 
 This book gives the reader a number of bite size morsels about what to expect in the Emergent "conversation."  Unfortunately, that's it!  It is merely a very brief survey of a few aspects that the editors have chosen to bring forward.  There is no detailed explanations, no arguments, just straight-forward, "this is the way postmodern culture is and this is the way the Emerging Church should be" paragraphs.    Don't be fooled though, some of these concepts are much more thought out than you might think.  On the other hand, as a previous reviewer stated, some are not.  If you are looking for a description of the Emerging Church, I don't think this is the book you want.  But, if you're looking for a few paragraphs about different things they find important, you might want to check this one out 
 This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort.  I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end.  The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out.  I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book 
 This book gives a pretty solid overview of Japanese History in a brief manner. I felt it concentrated a little heavily in some areas. For example they went on and on about the Tale of the Genji then wizzed through the Modern Japan section. They also made a harsh criticism of Saint Nichiren but on the other hand they hero worshipped Hideoshi. Despite the fact one was responsible for Buddhist reform and the other for killing as many people as possible in battle. So I thought some areas may have been quite biased according to their own favorite characters in Japanese History. You could do better than to buy this particular book 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 I had to look up "Doxography" in the Oxford English Dictionary - it is a collection of philosophical opinions. The book "Greek Astronomy" is a Dover reprint of a book written in 1932. It consists  of a long (57 pages) introduction followed by a great many quotes (rendered  into English) from ancient Greek authors. The selection emphasizes general  questions, such as "Does the Earth move?" - according to Ptolemy  it does not. Perhaps useful as a souce book. But then again, perhaps not 
 I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats.  What a discrace to punk.  I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off!  The only "American Idiots" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.  "WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT! 
       Never before has such a poorly written book received such acclaim. Maya Angelou wrote this story not with candor and grace but with a bias rarely allowed to sit on shelves let alone the top of a best-seller list. She was not humorous but had a heinousness of character and action that places her beyond the limits of human pity. This "inspiring author" did not demonstrate poignancy and depth but the crude rudiments of writing skill below that found in the essays of a primary school student.               Maya Angelou has portrayed herself as a victim of fate and yet at best her actions can only be described as foolhardy. In an attempt to prove to herself that she isn't a lesbian (a term she apparently doesn't understand) she initiates a deed without thinking of the consequences. She repeatedly gratifies her ego by exalting her academic accomplishments, yet doesn't grasp the fallacies of her own actions until it is far too late.             Several fans have seen her as an example to women. I must disagree with this ardently. Every teenage girl using her as a role model and demonstrating such lack of forethought puts herself at risk for sexual assualt, neglect, STDs, and teen pregnancy.             My only hope for this book is a quick and discreet cremation. May her name never be mentioned in the same breath as Margaret Atwood or any other great modern writer of either gender, and ANY nationality 
 Segall mumbles alot in this flick. Movie is disjointed and makes no sense. Characters are introduced that have no connection to the story. Segall stunt double is pretty good 
 Wow, I usually like books that are very metaphorical and complex, but I found this book to be too over the top. I became lost in the babble. It put me to sleep. I was too tired to find the symbolism and critiques of  society 
 Amazon, I took the time to write a review for this almost 2 weeks ago and have yet to see it posted.  If it will not be posted please at least let me know why.  Thank you 
 This textbook takes microeconomics which can be explained in a technical, exact manner and makes it abstract and foreign.  This textbook's sentences run-on and lose their direction, confusing the reader...If a reader had a firm understanding of economics prior to this textbook, after reading it, it is certain that they will no longer have the understanding of economics, that they did previously.  It is a travestly when a textbook designed to teach the reader about a certain subject, actually makes them less knowledgeable of the subject.  I must also ask why it is being used to teach university students in different years and programs, when it should not be, for example in my university it is being taught in the following programs  IBBA - Year 1 BBA - Year 2 BAS - Year 3 MBA - Year  
 I have a corded USB wireless antenna from Linksys that keeps falling off the table, so I thought I'd give this 'great new wireless' card a shot. I got it today and all the things the other reviewers said is happening to me also. It connects and then automatically disconnects. I tried NOT using their driver disc and letting Windows (XP) set it up (like the Linksys one did) and it forces me to use their driver, which won't work. I'm sending it back 
 I have read several of Connelly novels starting with the Closers and reading most of them back to the Poet. I have held the Poet as being Connelly's poorest example of prose until I read A Darkness More Than Night. As a college educated individual I found that it took too far fetched that a FBI profiler would base his entire profile off of two individuals having the same name. As a literature student I found each scene/chapter of the book to be a repeat of the one before it or one found in another book. Also Connelly puts so much weight on Bosch's character and then undermines his position, which destroys the book. He also portrays Kiz Rider as having a disease rather than being lesbian, why should she be afraid to say that she is gay? Why should a writer use a character's sexuality as an element of mystery? As a law student I found every court scene to be more like any ABC/CBS drama than reality. Some have said that this is a good read because Connelly "weaves" other characters from his books into this one, but like a "greatest hits" album the actual album is always stronger than the compilation. The Narrows, Lost Light and The Closers are much stronger books and more worth your time 
 I've read every book Catherine Coulter has ever written, but to be honest, what started out as a series of great FBI crime novels, has turned into so much phooey! If she writes one more book with the Tuttles and their talent for "mass hypnosis", I will hurl. And the two main characters in this book, well, I don't think they could be more docile and boring. I think Savach and Sherlock should have been retired after the pitiful excuse for a novel that was Ms. Coulter's last book. Come on!!! Mass Hypnosis??? It's an insult to the reader's intelligence 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 While this book has beautiful pictures on every other page, and cute little blurbs about doshas and skin care, it is really not a very informative book on ayurvedic skin care.  A person who has never heard of ayurveda before may benefit from the basic information in this book, but to anyone who has read another book on ayurveda, this book will be a dissapointment.  I much prefered Melanie Sach's book Ayurvedic Beauty Care, or Pratima Raichur's Absolute Beauty, which are both much more in depth.  However, if you are looking for a beautiful, interesting looking coffee table or bathroom book, this would be a good choice 
 Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this 
 Remember those courses you took in college where you spent a lot of time reading and studying for midterms, but you forgot everything a week later? That's this book.  Don't be fooled by any of the reviews or the book jacket. The book's thematic approach makes this history inaccessible and honestly, pretty lame. Alexander's epic life is not told chronologically, instead each chapter focuses in one aspect of Alexander's entire life (such as "The Divinity of Alexander" or "Alexander and the Persians"), then jumps around citing battles and events which are never fully explained. While I appreciate the orginality of its structure, you miss out on one of the most amazing aspects of Alexander - the time span of his life and accomplishments.  If you haven't read much on the subject of Alexander the Great, you should probably keep this book on the backburner, as you will have no idea what Cartledge is writing about most of the time.  Ultimately, not very engrossing and not very enlightening. If I were a better reviewer I'd suggest an alternative book, but you can probably get more information in a couple hours from the somewhat unbalanced 2004 A&E documentary "The True Story of Alexander the Great" - which, if nothing else, helps you see what Alexander accomplished in such a short amount of time - even if the facts are a little blurry 
 At first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. Then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results 
 On our recent road trip, my girlfriend and I brought along some audio books to help us stay awake. Both were historical fiction set in ancient Greece. Sappho's Leap was read by the author, and her mangled pronunciations and over-dramatic tone may have influenced my reaction, but I don't think so.  Unlike Thermopylae, the subject of Gates of Fire (review coming soon), virtually nothing about Sappho is known, Ms. Jong was free to make up just about any story she liked. And she did. Sappho's Leap is a sappy love story with a long interlude where Jong basically plagiarizes Homer, only watering him down to speed the plot. Further, and to make matters worse, Sappho's Leap is not very well-written. It is melodramatic, banal, and overly adjectival. It reads like syrup. Jong apparently can't think of a word for vagina other than "delta" and nothing for penis other than "phallus," which words are like comedy catchphrases by the end of the novel.  The book starts out well. Sappho has climbed a cliff, but pauses to reflect on the story of her life (in media res, like every Greek story). She starts at the beginning, relating how she runs away from hom with Alceous, a famous Lesbian singer. They are exiled from Lesbos for trying to overthrow its tyrant, and her adventures begin. She is married off to a paunchy lush who lives in Syracuse, although pregnant with Alceous's child, to be named Cleis (mispronounced by Jong). When her husband dies, the adventure begins in earnest. After a stay in Egypt, Sappho takes off with the fabulist, Aesop, for Delphi, but is frequently sidetracked along the way. Jong sends Sappho to the Amazons on Crete (?!?) where she causes the return of Pegasus, the island of the centaurs, the underworld, Medusa's sister, etc. In an age where the Greeks occupied the majority of the Mediterranean, Sappho manages to elude everyone for a space of ten years or more, which occupy maybe four chapters of the book.  These adventures are trite, simplified copies of the Odyssey, and add almost nothing to the plot. Nothing really improves from there. Once Sappho returns to the land of the real, Jong wraps things up quickly and predictably. The novel ends with a syrupy, happy ending. Sappho and all her lovers and friends end up living on another random island with her friends, until her daughter sails up with her grandchildren. Ugh.  And don't get me started on the "poems" at the end.  This was my first Erica Jong book, and I think it will be my last. It gets two stars only because I need a lower rung for truly pulp romance, which this book just barely isn't 
 Talk about a typically clueless American. I threw this book away after reading about half in exasperation 
 First, some did talk.  They, too, were assassinated.  Second, the assassins were talking, but not in English.  Foreign hitmen were hired.  How many Americans speak Iranian (Farci)? Third, those with power and influence who knew the truth were afraid to speak because Establishment pressure on the media would have ended their careers in short order.  
 I heard him talk, this guy is an idiot. A conspiracy theory is al this is 
 A silly, shallow and uniformed bio that falls far short of lending any insight nor new information on this brilliant author/illustrator. Written by a local reporter for the San Diego Union, this is one of those "gee, and I knew him!" efforts that does not deserve to be seriously considered.  Pass on it 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 Wow, what a bore. The old stock footage is uneven and doesn't show enough of the truck. Other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street. The song is OK, but once that's over my son walks away. Why would a child who LOVES trucks walk away? Because some guy's voice (which sounds like it's in an echo chamber) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he can't SEE on the screen. What's on the screen? More garbage stock footage. This looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone's basement 
 I enjoyed all her other books and was looking forward to this one.  What a disappointment.  If you are reading this series because you like the archaeological aspects, skip this one there aren't any 
 ALL OF THE SONGS ARE BORING. I HATE THEM. THEY ARE SLOW AND BORING AND THEY MAKE YOU WANT TO FALL ASLEEP 
 Poor quality. One of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times. 
 I was such a huge Tiesto fan until I saw this DVD.  I bought it on the basis of other reviews but I guess I haven't yet joined the cult of P so have missed the point of the DVD.  Tiesto is a master at what he does there is no doubt about that however after this DVD I have lost some respect for him.   I thought from the DVD I would learn a little more about the man eg influences, inspiration etc etc.  instead all I got was a DVD that showed yet again that the DJ has become greater than the music (and I won't debate the merits or otherwise of that) and endless shots of (mostly Americans) going on about how brilliant he is.  This DVD is self adulation / promotion at its worst, all I can say is shame on you Tiesto making suckers out of your fans 
 This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off). 
 pretending that 3-6 never happened (don't we all wish that!) this flea bag starts with ms.curtis hiding out as the head mistress of a private school(with a false name what kind of back ground check did they use on her) and still living in fear of her brother michael. well as you can guess he's back and still a little pissed off that she became a star and he has had to do all these bad sequels.    nothing new here and nothing worth seeing (but at least we do get to see jamie and her late mother janet (playing her "pyscho" role once again) act together for what would be the last time).  just a waste of time but i hope it helped put ms. curtis's daughter in collage, as that is the only reason i can think of that would get her back into this mess 
 If Tom Perrotta meant "Joe College" to be a coming-of-age story, he fell flat on his face.  Danny (the protagonist) comes from a working-class family and struggles and scrapes his way into Yale.  Good for him!  Too bad that's not the story.  By the time we meet Danny, he's already an ivy leaguer.  Despite his proletariat backstory, Danny tends to behave just as selfishly and irresponsibly as any of his silver-spoon, trust-fund classmates who I guess we're supposed to think he's better than.    I don't want to give too much away here, so suffice it to say that Danny makes one of those BIG, life-altering mistakes that any guy can make. You know, the tried and true premise of the young man with everything going for him who suddenly faces something that threatens to screw up his future.  Does he face it like a man, resolve the conflict, and "grow" as a human being?  Nope.  Perrotta lets Danny get away with ignoring the serious consequences of his actions and, instead, focuses on a ridiculous sub-plot (or was it the main plot? I couldn't tell) about the mafia and ruthless bodybuilding snack food vendors.  What's worse, Danny basically gets a free pass.  He ignores his self-created crisis, and it just sort of fades away.  And once it's gone, Danny strolls right out and does the same, stupid thing he did the first time to get himself in serious trouble.  Lessee . . . a self-centered Yale student who makes big mistakes, screws up other people's lives, ignores the consequences, shirks responsibility, lets other people deal with his mistakes for him, and then caps it off by going out partying and acting irresponsibly again. 'Psssst,' Mr. Perrotta -- That's not the kind of character we root for.  That's the kind of character we boo. And occasionally elect President.  Two stars because "Joe College," despite its flawed premise, is pretty readable and provides some insight into the mildly interesting, seedy underworld of mobile snack stand vendors 
 I was a bit disapointed in this book.  It is basically a blank journal for you to write in.  I was expecting a diet guide 
 I cannot believe all the positive reviews of this book. This is one of the dumbest, most painfully will-it-ever-end stories I have read.  This book is chock full of predictable plot points, boring characters and ridiculous dialogue.  Here's an example -- delivered by a mid-60's Vatican monsignor, hilariously named "Vigor...."  "This ancient society of mages must have known the location of Alexander's tomb after Septimus Severus hid it in the third century. They left it undisturbed, letting it safeguard the most valuable scrolls from the lost library. Then perhaps the quake in 1303 not only brought down the lighthouse, but exposed the tomb. They took the opportunity to hide more down there, using the chaotic time after the earthquake to plant their next clue, bury it, and allow the centuries to cover it up again."  Here's the punchline. "Vigor" delivers this soliloquy under water USING SCUBA GEAR!  I would be remiss if I did not also mention the grammatical errors which are too numerous to count. Is this bad writing or just bad editing?  The biggest dummy here, I must confess, is ME -- for buying this book on the recommendations of many who compare James Rollins with Dan Brown and declare James Rollins the better writer. (And on top of that I paid 20 bucks for this thing so that I could read it in eBook form.) Well, my friends, Dan Brown may not be a scholar, but at least he is entertaining and creates interesting characters and semi-plausible situations. The same can't be said for Jimmy Rollins. Dan Brown he ain't.  Map of Bones? Bag of Rocks says I 
 Shallow characters, plot uninteresting, interactions not convincing at all. In my eyes, Kellerman's best trait has been always the depiction of the anti-urban American landscape and way of life. His detective plots (decent at most) were just the vehicle fot this depiction. But in this novel not even that subproduct is achieved. As some other reader pointed out, the novel is little more than a series of "drove there-wore this-ate that" sequences that leave us wanting. Stephen Cannel plus clothing descriptions 
 This is one of the most well known hatchet jobs done on Nietzsche over the last two decades in hopes of selling the idea that Nietzsche is a postmodernist -- that is, a person who buys into the notion that the world is a text, or that text is everything, or that there is nothing outside the text, or some other grotesque expansion of the power of words.  But Nietzsche is not one of those types.  Indeed, 'there is nothing outside the text' is one of those pieces of philosophical insanity that can only be compared to other such pieces: like Parmenides belief that nothing moves, or Barkeley's belief that there is no such thing as matter, or Palto's belief that things do not have their properties, or Kant's belief that because we have categories we cannot know, and so on.   Nehamas and postmodernism are outgrowths of German Idealism.  Nietzsche rejected that school.  Almost everything he fought he called 'idealism' at one point or another in hiw career.  He thought of German philosophy as a flight from reality, and a coward's philosophy designed to make a big show and distract everyone from how paltry and small minded one's German soul really was.  The very notion of life as literature is self-contradictory.  But, of course, like all postmodern theorists, Nehamas is un-selfcritical.  His rectitude is all that matters.  Like all postmodernists, he demands that we sacrifice our knowledge in order to accept an absurdity.  His absurdity: that a pretend Nietzsche is of the same value as the real Nietzsche -- that imaginary and real are equal.  
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 I can't even believe alkaline trio even let that be put on a cd, that is terrible 
 I LOVE Suzanne Brockmann's writing. If she were any other author, I'd give it 1 star. This one just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the heroine Jane (who seemed irritating & immature) and I didn't care about Cosmo (i guess the character development was lacking). I couldn't identify with the gay FBI agent and the intern chasing the in-the-closet actor storyline was a flat out bore. I read romance for escape - one of the last things I want to do is escape into a homosexual love story. I never finished her last book (an extremely disappointing read - the one abt the CIA agents). I don't know if i'm going to finish this one. I certainly hope Max & Gina's story doesn't follow this pattern of poorly developed characters. 
 Okay, you may think that I do not appreciate the so-called classics, but I have to be honest--I simply cannot stand this book. The language is so bad, and even the ending is horrible. The only good thing I can say about the whole thing is that it's very short. It's only a few chapters long, and that's it.   I read this book with my English class in high school, and reading it once was more than enough for me. Not to diss John Steinbeck or anything like that, but this book is one of the worst books in all of literature. I don't even understand why they call this lame piece of work a "classic". 
 I had seen a copy of this book prior to purchase in an older edition. I liked it very much. It contains a lot of useful information laid out in a very readable fashion; however, I purchased a paperback copy. That was a big mistake! The type in the paperback edition is tiny. Reading this edition is difficult, and a lot of the impact of the creative layout is lost with the small pages. In retrospect, I would seek a larger format than the edition that measures 8.9 x 7.3 x 0.7 inches. 
 This book is not for anyone at an advanced level- whilst there is a whole lot of information, each technique is described in one page, with very little depth. Some of the examples chosen to highlight a particular technique are odd indeed - why for example, if one was showing how to paint "dappled sunlight", would the subject matter be a building? I may be odd myself (who knows), but the term 'dappled sunlight' brings a rural/country scene to mind... 
 As a huge Byrds fan, I was really looking forward to this book. I wanted to read about the excitement of 1965, when the opening jingle jangle of Roger McGuinn's twelve string guitar in Mr. Tambourine Man announced an entirely brand new style of music. Instead, what I got was 300 booring pages that seemed like 3000. What a disappointment! Turn! Turn! Turn! reads like a hardware catalog. The material is often booring, repetitive, or unnecessary. The author manages to include every obscure recording artist, record label, and producer of the early folk-rock genre, many, more than once or twice. Great. Ho-hum. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. What he doesn't do is re-capture the magic of the moment. Reading this book felt like a prison sentence. DO NOT buy this book, folk-rock fans. Hey, you don't find this review helpful? Good! Buy the book and waste your ...time and money 
 I was super excited when I bought Joann Rosario's first CD "More, More, More." Every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship. I was just as thrilled when I found out she had a new release, "Now More Than Ever...Worship." I heard one of her singles, "God" and figured I HAD to buy the cd when it came out. But boy was I disappointed when I popped it in my cd player!!! The only stand out tracks are:  Track 3: Thanks Be Unto God Track 6: I Hear You Say Track 13: God The Bonus Track: Cuando Reposo En Ti   All of the other tracks are barely mediocre. It was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight. I am extremely upset that I wasted $20 on this piece of junk. I thought some worship music would be on here, since the title of the cd is "Worship," but don't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face. She should've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music. Joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump. I highly doubt that I'd buy anything else she sings. What was Fred Hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent? It's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd. The entire cd lacks the anointing. Even the bonus video clip on the installed media player, that features Joann and Donnie McClurkin sucks. All she does is add libs in Spanish, plays some maracas, some castanets and God knows what else and I'm supposed to bust a move to this?! NO WAY!!!   Two thumbs WAY, WAY DOWN!!!  A feeble effort by Joann. This will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth, as it did mine. 
 (I don't have time for a full review right now,so I will write a few comments and try to add to them.)  I knew very little about XML, so this sounded promising.  As of Chapter 8, my general comments are:      1.  The teaching structure is often murky.  At many spots, the authors don't seem to grasp what a beginner needs to know first in order to go to the next step.  This makes the material unnecessarily difficult and confusing.      2.  Instead of one example page, for some reason the authors will sometimes create one XML page to illustrate a point, then create another completely different page to illustrate the next point, then go back to the first one for the next point, etc.  It's inexplicable.  The book would be much easier to follow, and probably easier to write, if they built one XML page from scratch and used/modified it throughout the book.      3.  There are too many editorial screw-ups, such as "Figures" that are labeled incorrectly or don't exist -- that is, the text will say "see Figure 7 for the output" and Figure 7 will be the wrong one.  I really have no patience with expensive books that don't bother to pay for one thorough copy-editing.      I am currently on Chapter 8 (XSLT), one of the worst-written ones.  After a completely unnecessary discussion about "procedural" versus "declarative" programming (I imagine every reader is at least basically familiar with css, and if not, it is hardly difficult to understand "declarative" programming), the book just starts throwing XLST terms at you, with no foundation as to what they are doing or why. I finally gave up and pulled up the online W3C tutorial.  This tutorial is free, covers most of the material, and is well-organized and easy to understand.  Teaching in logical order isn't that hard.      There is a ton of good information in "Beginning XML", and the information on how to find, install, and use software such as Saxon and Schematron is invaluable.  It is a shame that the authors didn't take the time to actually give the book to a few XML novices and then rewrite it as the introductory text it is supposed to be.  The poorly organized writing at least doubles, and often triples, the time, energy, and painful confusion needed to learn the material 
 Too salty for me, there is a better brand out there 
 The book contained too much detail on manufacturing.  I would have preferred the book to cover less ground.  The review entitled "Words, words, words", encompasses my view exactly.  Unfortunately I did not read all the reviews first.  I will not make that mistake again 
 Titan A.E. should have been an epic movie full of thought provoking ideas. With talents like the legendary Don Bluth on animation, skilled sci-fi screenwriters like Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Ben Edlund (The Tick) writing the screenplay and stars like Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman and Nathan Lane doing voice over work and a [...]dollar budget the movie had all the elements of a hit. Unfortunately all these talented individuals failed to become successful when brought together on this project. Titan A.E. is an uninspired mess of a movie with a predictable story, dated looking animation, flat acting and primitive looking CGI. Thanks in part to the box office failure of this movie and several others like Treasure Planet and Atlantis, hand drawn animated movies are currently not being produced by American movie studios. A shame because there are so many great stories to tell using this art form.  Titan A.E. follows the story of Cale, a young boy in the year 3028 or something. Cale's father has built a spaceship The Titan, which can recreate an Earth like planet when activated. Big blue off the shelf computer generated aliens known as The Drej find out about the Titan and go to Earth to destroy it. During a final onslaught on the planet, Cale's father gives his son to an alien to care for along with a ring then gets on another ship. The Titan escapes along with a few million human survivors. Five-year-old Cale helplessly watches as the Drej blow up Earth and kill his father. So bleak, so boring so predictable.  Cut to fifteen years later. Cale a young man now, is working a crummy job at a space station. True to formula, he's angry and disillusioned drifting through life with no direction. After an unappetizing lunch of living creatures, Cale runs afoul of some human hating aliens. He's about to get pummeled when he conveniently he runs into Korso, a man who says he's been searching the galaxy for fifteen years for him on his quest to find the Titan. He activates a code in Cale's ring and conveniently the Drej head to the station to kill him. It would have been helpful to give the bad guys some character development here. I find it odd how the Drej found Cale at the same time as Korso but not for the past fifteen years despite being smart enough to blow up a planet. Cale and Korso shoot it out with the Drej to escape the space station, but the bug like cook who served lunch is a casualty of the assault. They hotwire a spaceship which gets damaged as it leaves the station and make a thrilling jump into space without spacesuits. Too bad this makes no sense scientifically. Their bodies would have exploded from the pressure before they asphyxiated.  The movie goes on in spite of this minor plothole. On board Korso's ship Cale meets the attractive Akima, who looks both hot and edgy along with other members of Korso's alien crew. The quest for the Titan begins and the slowly paced movie starts to get even slooower, changing into a ninety minute long chase where we watch Cale and Akima start a lukewarm romance, shooting, arguing between Cale and the crew, arguing between Cale and Akima, arguing between Cale and Korso, two brief scenes where nudity is teased, and just more arguing and shooting leading to Predictable plot twist #1: Korso is working for the Drej and plans on destroying the Titan when they find it. True to formula, Korso gets a change of heart and sacrifices himself and Cale activates the Titan after learning predictable plot twist #2: Drej are beings of pure energy and they would power the Titan when it recreates the Earth like planet. Cale figures this out in record time and recreates the planet calling it "Bob". The movie ends and I shed a tear as I watch an opportunity to make something truly innovative in the Science Fiction genre wasted by a bunch of people who have the talent to do much better. Titan A.E. fails as a science fiction movie because of a poorly written script that has the plot and character development of a bad 1980's Saturday morning cartoon. Edlund and Whedon's weak screenplay plays everything safe and takes no risks in telling Cale's story. Movies in the Science Fiction genre always take risks exploring the worlds they inhabit and exploring the personalities of the characters who live in the universe. There was a story to tell here, but the writers focused on the wrong characters and the wrong plot points. The real story should have been with Cale's father not Cale. I wanted to know why he made the Titan and why was there a need to create a new Earth like planet. Could Earth have been overpopulated and scientists felt they needed a new world was the solution to handle the masses? Did the energy based Drej fear Earthmen exploiting their race as power source for the Titan? Perhaps Drej spies read about slavery in ancient American history texts and colonization of foreign lands during the colonial period and felt the need for a pre-emptive strike. These were deeper reasons for an intergalactic planet destroying war and should have been the focus of the movie's overall plot. Production wise, Titan A.E. is subpar. Bluth's hand-drawn animation for Fox looks horribly outdated when put side to side with the work of other animators at the competing animated studios of Disney, DreamWorks and Warner Brothers in the same year. Bluth's backgrounds are often too dark and character movements over exaggerated. Bluth, true to his style over the past thirty years focuses too much on wide shots of flailing of limbs to express character emotion and not on close-ups of facial expressions to tell his story. Watch any of Bluth's Disney films (Robin Hood, The Fox and the Hound) or his 90's Fox films (Anastasia, The Land Before Time, An American Tail) to see how little his style has changed with the times. The CGI has no detail and doesn't blend into the backgrounds smoothly. The Drej and their ships look like they belong in another film not here in Titan A.E. Compare the animation in Titan A.E. to DreamWorks' Road to El Dorado released that same year. Road does everything Titan A.E wanted to do from a technical standpoint blending CGI and animation beautifully. Brad Birds' work on Warner's Iron Giant features a well-written story and is a brighter film with lively human characters and beautiful backgrounds. Disney's later efforts like Kim Possible and Lilo and Stitch have more engaging characters and utilize unique animated character designs. Titan A.E. with its looks and feels like a 1980's movie not a 2000 theatrical release.  Fox was setting up Titan A.E. to be a sci-fi classic that pushed the genre of hand-drawn animated films into the adult themed direction of Japanese Manga. Ironically, the failure of these "riskier" hand-drawn animated movies like Fox's Titan, A.E., DreamWorks Road to El Dorado, Warner's The Iron Giant, Disney's Treasure Planet and Atlantis halted the production of hand-drawn animated films in America for the time being. Because American studios and audiences continue to see hand-drawn animated films as children's fare filmmakers cannot push the envelope and tell the adult themed stories of their Japanese counterparts. Until American movie studios and audiences change their perceptions about hand-drawn animation, filmmakers will never be able to make hand-drawn animated movies with mature themes and expand the audience for the art form past small children. Pass this one by at the video store. Adults looking for an adult themed animated movie should Pick up the far superior Heavy Metal or Castle of Cogliostro and preteens looking for a non-Disney animated film can pick up the superior Road to El Dorado, The Iron Giant or The Prince of Egypt. 
 "Big Fish" is the most horrible movie ever. The only reason i couldn't go any lower than a 1 is because it can't go lower than a 1. I WOULD NOT LIKE TO BUY THIS EVER!!!!!!! 
 I was a little bit disappointed with this book. There are two reasons for that. 1This book mainly consists of innuendos and depictions about modern cultures. And there are only a few scientific evidences, which back up his theory. 2,Contrary to his assertion, there are already many scientific researches about modern culture. And those researches don't necessarily back up his theory. But it seems he ignored them. I don't think it's fair. When we talk about this kind of controversial topic, what we need last is innuendo. But this book was made of that! Especially speculations about the brain had been terrible historically. A lot of scientists made the speculations about the brain and the real life, and they turned out to be garbage during the brain-imaging era. This book isn't different from the critics of modern culture, which he time and again criticized. Maybe I expected too much. There are lots of researches and articles and reports about effects of modern culture to the brain. But there are few books,especially about the game. So I thought this book would surely offer people a lot of scientific knowledge   But instead the evidences he cited were the Flynn effect (if you call it evidence), and a few other researches (some games' positive effects to spatial ability and gamers' positive character). which included NONE of the researches about films ,TV ,comics...  But as far as I know, there are tons of researches, which scanned the brain activity, which was related to modern culture. And it's surprising that he didn't cite any of those in this era I suspect that's because they usually don't support his theory.  For example, when people play games, their brain activities vary. But usually frontal lobe, which is thought to be the most important part of the high level brain, doesn't work. And even when it does, their activities decrease as players get used to the game. (Though one research indicates parietal lobe, which is related to spatial ability, is activated very much during some games, and that back up the positive effect of games to the spatial ability). Other researches don't necessarily support his theory, either. Hard-core gamers show bad grades whatever the cause. Hard core gamers are worse at a circuit task, maze tests. Gamers are less logical than others, they don't show higher ability to use information, they aren't more social,  aren't more creative (contrary to the research he cited) though they have more audio-visual skills.. And in my country students' academic ability is worsening. The Flynn effect is O.K. but don't forget that the children's performance of  "GO or no GO task" is significantly worsening.  And researches about TV? Comics? Don't get me start it. So the conclusion is this. This book consists of innuendos and depictions and a few evidences, which are convenient for him, and ignored all the evidences, which are not convenient for him. And clearly he is exploiting the readers' ignorance in his field. What he wanted to show was that most modern cultures were good for the overall high level brain function, but the only thing what he showed was that some games were good for the spatial ability. Don't be deceived by his eloquent depictions. This book is a waste of time, if you want fact, not opinions. 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 Now here is a great collection of traditional hymns of praise & worship that you'd expect to be fabulous listening given the great voices offered on this cd.  The problem lies in the really crappy arrangements. Here you will get to listen to LEANING ON THE EVERLASTING ARMS, arranged to sound like something you'd hear at a cocktail lounge! Songs whose tempo should be somewhat upbeat like, NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD, is slowed down to a really boring cadence that becomes just plain irritating.  There are much, much better versions of all these sacred songs to be found on other recordings. The only one worth listening to is the last track: HE TOUCHED ME, by The Isaacs, and they couldn't mess up any song even if they tried. Save your money & skip this one 
 I read Ms Eng's sparkling book, and I was happy to see it out there and to see this visible sign of recognition for Asian American women as a diverse and outspoken group. But the actual content of this book struck me as irrelevant and possibly even damaging to Asian American women who may be struggling with family violence. Too often, intergenerational or cultural differences are invoked by violent parents or spouses as a way to try and justify behavior that is unacceptable in any culture. Growing up Asian American, it's possible that concerns about identity, cultural integrity, and so on, can cause a lot of internal conflict over the 'right' way to live, how to define happiness, success, and so on. Ms Eng's book does not address the significant number of Asian American women who may not be 'assertive' or 'feel powerful' NOT because they are subject to some kind of internalized model minority stereotype, but because they are trauma survivors, violence survivors. People whose parents reinforced their cultural dictates by beating, threatening, even using weapons.  Ms Eng's book and portrayal of parental disapproval, affection, suspicion of new ways, is a charming one. But it presupposes a lot of things - parents' basic sanity, no mental illness of the parents, no actual violent impediments to a child breaking away from the parents and forging her own identity. For many Asian American women, "claiming a powerful life" has meant running from violence, sometimes literally, to start something from the ground up. These women may not look like Phoebe Eng in demeanor - they may be soft spoken because they've learned that's how one avoids being hit; they may be deceptive rather than confrontational because they are afraid. They need our community wide support for their healing - not lectures on how they should be more assertive and unafraid. They need our total rejection of violent behavior under any cultural justification batterers (spouses or parents) might offer. I hope if you are an Asian American woman and you read Ms Eng's book, and felt isolated in your very different experience - of, say, a parent who said you were "worthless", not merely "incomprehensible" for choosing a different career path; a parent who beat you instead of affectionately grumbling and filling your freezer with homecooked food - you will not feel alone. There are Asian American women warriors out there who are not glossy, who are not lecturing/condescending, who do not tell their stories of foraying out of corporate law as if these stories should represent Asian American women working in factories, escaping abusive marriages, or working their way out of being domestic workers. You can find a community of support if you reach out. Good luck to you and may you be strong 
 I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.    My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.     Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.  Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.    So in summary the current Lexar encryption software: - Can't be used on a Windows domain machine - Can't be used on an Intel Mac - Breaks the DVD on a PPC Mac  It's not for me!  However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay. 
 MC Hammer.  Then... "Hammer".  Then the out of control payroll.  The mega dancers... the big show, the baggy pants, the funky hair-cut... the bankruptcy, Vanilla Ice Feud, and then Surreal Life with Webster.  MC HAMMER!  This was the second big album from the late-80's, early 90's dance guru that had a penchant of taking old school baselines and tunes while dancing to them with this enormous entourage of performers.  1990... the year of Wilson Philips, Milli Vanilli, Sinead O'Conner, Bel Biv Devoe and loads of others.  Or was it 1989?  Bah.. does it really matter?  To be fair, this really WAS the bees knees back then.  Who can forget "2 Legit 2 Quit", or how about "U Can't Touch This"?  That song was so wildly overplayed that I actually credit it for teaching me the basics into radio programming and commercialism and the value of my own personal collection.  My word... I'm getting nightmares just thinking about how you could turn from one station to the next, and then to the NEXT with the same bloody song still on the radio.  But it got the dance parties going and you just weren't in the know if you didn't have your copy of MC Hammer's album in your jr. high school.  And gees... this was so un-original.  I mean, they took the line from Prince's cut yet "When Dove's Cry" wasn't ancient when this came out.  Then the "Have You Seen Her" love wrap was sorta funny and cool (back then).  But y'know, now that my memory is jogged, I don't think I was so impressed with the general album in the early 90's either because there were some crummy tracks in it even for that time period.    For the sheer comedy value, I'd recommend this.  For the 'musical value', i'd say your red cent is better spent in the circling coin rolling machine at your local shopping center.  Yes, people are actually selling this for 1 cent (maybe not even American...) - that's perhaps a fraction of the cost of shipping!  I'd actually haggle with them until they agree to pay the shipping for you and throw in the atrocious bomb of a 'step' album that he put out in the mid 90's too.  Looking at all of the behind the scenes things that happened, the rise and fall of such artists that came from his entourage (B Angie B, Vanilla Ice, etc.) you can't help but remember the past and chuckle.  The image of the video to "Can't Touch This" alone puts me in tears ... the bridge where he dances - priceless.  Yet I can't be too hard on him - Hammer was always about the live shows and if you got to go to those, the man could really move!  I mean, didn't it help distract you from the hollow lyrics too?  But I guess in an era with emerging gangsta rap (NWA, etc. were still on the rise), it was a welcome, lighter change.  
 This is the worst movie I've ever seen... Damn!!! I don't even want to listen to the soundtrack, there is no reason in losing time........... 
 DBF was trying something different with this book- and I appreciate that- but the effort just didn't gel.  Grace, a worldly travel agent, lets her overbearing extended family bully her emotionally.  This organized and ballesie travel agent, whose boyfriend does stem cell research, caves into that?  That premise didn't wash and Grace's extended and detailed faith crisis really wore me down.    DBF's humor was still there, but I disliked Grace's family so much, and tired of the overly described faith crisis, that I just became irritated and started skimming and flipping pages to get finished (I've never had to do that with a DBF book before).   The travel agent slant allowed DBF to describe other locales, but, DBF, please return to writing about the sea water and marsh of the Low Country.  That's what hooked us! 
 My child loved this gift, however, the lightbulb went out almost immediately and I cannot find a replacement anywhere!  
 Not at all memorable.  Formulaic in that Oprah's Book Club sort of way...martyr-like female who is a "better" person at the end of the book having learned a valuable lesson about life, love, the world or all three.  Yawn, yawn, yawn...there are too many good books in the world to waste your time reading this 
 Episode two of the hunt for the bumbling master spy(Peacemaker) is an improvement over the unfortunate initial episode, No Graves as Yet. There are some good scenes: the beaches at Gallipoli, the amusing downfall of Judy's competitor for the General's wheel, the encounter with the German sub, etc.  But we still have the preposterous underlying theme that George V would trade continental Europe for German help in retaking the United States for the British Empire. That task made more difficult as Miss Perry has Mexican armies pouring over the Southwestern border to conquer the U.S. Even Zimmerman didn't expect that much.  Then there is Private Corliss who dominates the opening chapters by suffering a crushed hand, a suspected Self Inflicted Wound(SIW), for which he is court martialed and sentenced to death.  In WWI, the test for an SIW was whether the injury was caused by British ammunition, not the case here. There were 3,894 recorded SIWs in the British Army during the war; the penalty was a prison sentence. No one was subject to the death penalty for an SIW. We have Chaplain Joseph who spends half the book playing police detective; a general in command of substantial forces at Ypres who spends most of his time with his attractive driver and seems to have no contact with his regimental commanders or the battles; a reporter for a small newspaper chain whose accurate depiction from Gallipoli would cause millions of Britons to abandon the war, even though the millions had already heard the truth from their sons, daughters, and husbands; etc. On the bright side, there is a new Pitt mystery, Long Spoon Lane, where Miss Perry makes us feel right at home in both the drawing rooms and the slums of Victorian London.  IMO her reach toward World War I is a war too far. 
 I was attracted to the theme of this book, but the author makes you work excessively hard in getting to the core. This book could have used a redraft and/or a good hard edit - I was struggling to get through it and skipped quite a lot of it. Not because I have a short attention span, but because of the repetition and focus on boring minutiae, which I don't think adds anything to the story. I'm not sure whether the author thinks her readers are unable to grasp subtleties therefore need everything spelled out for them, but I feel this could have been fixed with further drafting - it really has the feel of being a little undercooked. Better editing would have also fixed the misuse of many complex words and phrases, which you do not expect to read when the format is letters from a professional travel writer (the narrator). All power to the author for winning the 2005 Orange prize and achieving success in a tough market, but I would not rush out to read her other books 
 The book is set up well with questions to help guide your reading at the beggining of each chapter.  I agree with other posts, that the author doesn;t deal well with the origin of evil. What most concerned me was his compromise of creationism.  He assumes that teh geologic data is correct and therefore wants to make the infallible scripture conform to infallible science, which has changed numerous times over the past several years.  I would not recommend this book at all and would recommend Lectures in Systematic Theology by Theissen instead.  It is an older book but much more reliable.  
 Prey is to a novel what the "wild swarm" Ricky was to the real Ricky: It presents a suggestion of a real book, but lacks the features, the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze.   Like the worst of the bodice-ripper genre, Prey's hero, Jack, makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go.   And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano-Ricky and nano-Julia, I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack's cell phone? You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?   Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating. For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1.     
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 I'll keep this short. I was contracted to draft the images in this book, for reproduction. The AutoCAD layout was not looking like the machinist drawings in the book (I used the books' dimensions). So I scaled the drawings in the book (as directed in the text). Then I took the dimensions from those parts. Way off. I can only assume that the dimensions (on every drawing) are intentionally wrong. Or the machinist templates (again, every drawing) are intentionally wrong. If this is a reference manual, then maybe the men in black have altered the contents of the pages so we may not have the information. Or maybe this book is just fiction. I realize this information should not be used to construct these parts. Still, the information should be acurate. Freedom of speech and of knowledge 
 atl has been falling a lot this year. not only are the fools d4l stealing cash but so is this lame rap group dem franchize boyz. they think theyre so cool cuz their name is DEM franchiZe boyZ instead of them franchise boys but really no one but dumb and helpless teenagers that happen to enjoy this cd. their music is lame, sorry ifi  offended you, but thats a fact, their beats are wack, lyrics are lame, one positive is that they dont rap about fu*king candy bars...whats next, d4l is gonna call thier music wrapping? anyways, about dfb, just about everything about thier music is lame. the only good song is the i think they like me one because of da brat. otherwise theres probably better rap acts in nebraska then these fools. go get some t.i., luda, shawnna, or da brat 
 This is a very cheap toy and mine arrived broken,  or at least I hope it's not supposed to sound like it does.  It sounds nothing like the classic Jack-in-the-box that I was hoping for 
 I love southern literature and try to keep up with the new volumes that come out; however, I felt completely let down by this collection of stories. Realizing that Christmas is not always the uplifting holiday that we hope it will be, these stories still left me feeling more depressed than thoughtful. I originally bought several copies to give as gifts, but after reading the entire book, I felt that I could not give someone else something that made me feel worse than I did before I picked it up. Reality may be very similar to these stories in some people's lives; however, at Christmas time, I would rather reach for what is the best and most honorable about humanity and leave the stark loneliness and despair for another time 
 I have read all of Ted Dekker's books and thought that his insight into the human condition is exceptional.  I loved the way he was able take a story and weave an examination of how I relate to God.  For example, the children eating the worm slime in Showdown as an allegory for our appetite for sin despite how it destroys our lives.  Another example is the whole Circle Trilogy.  His description in White when people have to inhale the water, i.e. give up their lives in order to live.    Lately, Dekker has rushed to put out books every couple of months and has lost his originality.  He is stuck in a rut.  His last three books have suspense and gore but lack the originality that led me to list him as one of my favorite authors.    Skin is a rehashed story of Showdown and Saint.  Revealing the killer at the end left me flat with no impact.  The teaser at the end of the book revealing an upcoming 6 book series based on the Horde seems more like a threat than a promise.    I hope he changes his mind and takes a sabbatical to work on a new storyline.  The sad part is that I am a Ted Dekker fan but wish he would get back to being a creative writer instead of continuing to try capitalizing on the success of Black, Red and White.  
 This movie is more a curiosity than a "chef d'oeuvre" (French for masterpiece) of erotism. It hasn't aged very well either... It may have been a hit then, because it was one of the first of its kind - although I am not sure.   Coming from my fellow French men, I was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this 2 hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism. I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some. 
 5 ml for $20. I would refuse to buy any printer that used this cartridge on principal. Die in a Fire, HP 
 OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless. There are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. On the other hand I hope they didn't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here's a prime example. After one of the captive girls dies:  "This is terrible. It reminds me of the day Zenobia died" "A relative?" "No, my favorite cow."  I guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient. Don't worry folks, it's on it's way 
 This book is awful.  Nowhere near as good as Dumas' better known work 
 I have ordered Intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. So far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. I will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. I now know why I pay $15.00 for two pair of Jockey's 
 It wasn't worth the money that I payed for. It is a good radio if you have an external antenna. I would play it in the office and could never get a decent signal until I had to pay an extra $30 for an antenna. If you are going to pay $300 plus you should get something that works out of the box. I could have purchased a lesser know brand and recieved better reception then what I got. Overall if you want to end up purchasing more products to make your system work to perfection this is the product for you. There are plenty of products that don't cost as much and deliver everthing this did and more. 
 not very nice....acording to me 
 I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this 
 I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better 
 The only reason I made it through this book is because it was our book club choice for the month.  Otherwise, I would have quit after the first chapter.  I found the girl's thought patterns unrealistic for a girl of 11.  The plot of story develpment was very weak, it didn't ripen until the very last few chapters.  By that time, I was so sick of the repetitious story line, I skimmed through it just so I could finish it.  The language was very rich and descriptive, but with such a boring story line, who cares?  I'm glad to be done with it!  
 This book was disappointing.  If you were in a book store you could have flipped through the pages and read over the book.  It just gives paragraphs from 1 to 1001 ideas.  The book is not that interesting 
 This book is generally outdated and written from the perspective of someone who wanted to offer an alternative to psychological interventions which he believed did not work.  But, he never proved that they did not work.  It was an exploration of new territory in the time that it was written, and does not hold much beyond historical value; as there are other books which explain cognitive theories of emotional disturbance and treatment for such in a more clear and precise manner. To the previous reviewer, talking is not primitive.  Black and white thinking is.  Wanting to simply explain and control is entirely primitive and based in fear and anxiety.  It is why we have gods, myths, fairy tales and legends.  Sitting in a room with someone you trust and talking through your problems is not primitive. Whether it is a friend, a relative, a stranger or a therapist, it is progressive and courageous; even by today's standards.  Trusting another human being and making a connection with them is superior human behavior.    Now, lets stop trying to be the one who has it right and start working together to heal people 
 Purchase this only if you have a minute idea of what a computer is.  This is very elementary and assumes you have absolutely no knowledge of what a network even is. It doesn't go any further than that either.  Don't expect that you will be learn how to network computers together (my expectation); only that you will learn what components are involved --but not how they work or how to actually network them. I don't mind basic info, but this book should be titled "Network Equipment Descriptions for Dummies" certainly not it's current title. Way too many jokes as well (more annoying than entertaining) 
 To me a "basic wool flannel trouser" would be a more classic fit. The very low waist (NOT waist), 4" zipper, too-long, and very wide cuff was an awful disappointment. I own 3 pr. Harve Benard from 4-5 years ago which fit me beautifully - same good tailoring, lined wool - so that's what I expected. I am 5'7" and this year's design drags on the floor and sits down on my hips. The pant legs are 4" wider than my old ones. Also missing here are the side elastic options 
 i hated this book, i finished it only under the circumstances of boredom. I can't believe this book made top book lists, who are these people?!!!!  The author's style of writing is very adolescent and annoying. The plot was predictable so therefore the book dragged out when this book could probably have been a short story. The narrator kept on directing rhetorical questions to the reader which really put me off about the  book as well. All the "philosophical" or thought provoking comments ridden throughout the book shouldn't be new ideas to anyone who has ever had any deep thoughts about anything.  Don't waste your time picking up this book 
 I was really looking forward to movie.  My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period.  Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.  My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors.  They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.  Maybe it got better (that is why I gave it two stars) but I find that doubtful.  I am wondering if both Tom Berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of Script Writing 101. 
 A learning resource manual is not the same as the real book! It's just for teachers, so they know questions what questions to ask on a test 
      First off, Desperation and The Regulators is not the same story. Yes certain characters are used, (some in name only) but that's all apart of the pun involved. The Regulators is supposedly the discovered manuscript of Richard Bachman, about an evil entity named Tak, who telepathically terrorizes a small suburban Ohio town through the use of a child's television heroes. Desperation, on the other hand, is about a mistakenly discovered tommyknocker, (not to be confused with the SK novel by the same name) who can manipulate and posses other living beings in the fictitious town of Desperation, NV. (Tak is also the antagonist in this prose.)       Without rehashing the synopsis of either book, this Stephen King fan enjoyed Desperation to a higher degree than The Regulators. In my opinion, the latter seems more of an extended short story and at no time did I find myself even remotely attached to any character presented in the material. Desperation however, was a more enjoyable read with a deeper plot line and thoroughly developed characters. If you happen to read The Regulators before Desperation don't fret. Neither book is in any kind of sequential order. Read one and think of the other as some sort of parallel universe.  
 If you are looking for a life changing positive Cancer recovery, you will not find it here. I rather read Lance Armstrong's mother's book about him and his cancer recovery.  Fran is very weak with this book, and you can see since she's shacked up with her new man, how she changed her story from Enter Whining, when she loved her husband and ranted on about positive things to saying we weren't independent people and not give the real reasons why they broke up. Instead, here she complains about her privledged life, doesn't go into detail unless it was about her younger man (who we could care less of) and not enough of about real emotions. I blame fran and not her doctors for a diagnosis, because she never stuck with the doctors and thought it was great to just never go back to them since they didn't tell her what she wanted to hear and went to all of her friends' hollywood celebrity doctors and not a real down to earth doctor. She comes out of her experience a overly negative person when she should have not went back and kept asking for more tests, could have worked things out with her husband. Instead, we hear more and more stories about things going back to her childhood ,sex with her younger man, and her trying to be hip to make a show with mtv. Fran, you are not young anymore, and stop blaming others and your childhood for your mistakes. She hasn't dealt with her rape issue all the way since she blames her marriage for failing for it and other things. I see this book as a negative downfall because Fran blames others and not herself for her actions, and the reason for not being determined to going back to the doctor when her body was telling her something was wrong.  If you want an uplifting story, find Linda Armstrong-Kelly's book about her and Lance, other wise stay away from this book to buy, rent from your local library 
 Todos los tpicos tienen algo de verdad, y aqul que dice que Borges es un escritor pedante para pedantes no es en absoluto una excepcin. Sus historias, a pesar de estar cuajadas en ocasiones de ideas interesantes, se ven total y completamente empaadas por el afn didctico y pomposo del autor a la hora de inundar sus escritos con referencias tanto reales como imaginarias a todo tipo de obras, autores, sucesos, etc, etc. Sus cuentos suelen adoptar ms bien la forma de un ensayo o de una disertacin filosfica que la de un relato convencional. Esto bien podra parecer algo original y audaz a simple vista, pero su ya mencionado didactismo, su escaso ritmo y la casi nula caracterizacin de sus personajes, restan muchsima fuerza a unas historias que, entre tanto aderezo culto y metaliterario, pierden todo aliciente a los ojos de cualquiera que haya disfrutado de narradores ms hbiles y conocedores del medio en el que se mueven.   Todava estoy tratando de dilucidar por qu diablos cosas como "Ficciones" o "El Aleph" estn consideradas como obras maestras cuando su inters no me parece que vaya ms all de lo puramente anecdtico. A todas luces el de Borges es un caso claro de egocentrismo o de vastas influencias literarias mal asimiladas.  Los aduladores borgianos, esa grimosa secta compuesta (generalmente) de elitistas literarios, seguramente dira, leyendo crticas como la ma, que la razn por la que Borges me desagrada es "porque no lo entiendo". Nada de lo que preocuparse, pues es bien sabido que para ellos toda aquella crtica negativa a su escritor de cabecera viene dada desde la frustracin de quien no logra aprehender al "seor del bastn". No falla, probad a poner en duda la grandeza del argentino, y ya veris cmo en pocos instantes os llueve encima un torrente de dicterios por parte de sus incondicionales poniendo en duda toda vuestra cultura general. En fin, que visto lo visto habr que borrar la palabra "pedante" del diccionario, total, como no hay libros malos, sino slo libros que no se entienden por los que los critican...  Jams he llegado a observar mayor grado de sectarismo que el que rodea a este autor por parte de muchos de sus admiradores (ni siquiera por los fans ms agresivos de autores "frikis" como Tolkien o Lovecraft), y en parte es por eso tambin por lo que no me gusta. He llegado a conocer gente que modifica sus gustos y preferencias literarias como borreguines para que casen exactamente con los de Borges. Y es que es tal el grado de arrobamiento comnmente requerido para la "correcta" apreciacin de este escritor, que de verdad a m me enferma. Sin duda a Borges se le puede considerar, independientemente de sus mritos literarios, un autntico soberano de insufribles.  No niego que Borges era un buen lector, que su amor por la literatura se deja traslucir de sobra en sus escritos, y que como crtico era bastante avispado, pero desde luego, en el plano literario, era totalmente incapaz de algo tan sencillo como contar una puetera historia sin exhibir gratuita y sistemticamente su supuesto grado de erudicin. En mi opinin, un narrador nefasto que obliga al lector a "adaptarse" continuamente y sin remisin a sus referentes culturales (como si stos fueran imprescindibles o necesariamente fascinantes). Presuntuoso, superfluo y, sobre todo, frustrante, pues promete lo que ni sabe ni puede dar.  He optado por escribir este comentario en castellano, idioma en el que Borges redacto sus obras, pero para el que curiosamente nunca tuvo nada bueno que decir hasta que recibi el premio "Cervantes". En fin que -aparte de su incompetencia literaria- fascinante desvergenza la suya (iba a decir "chaqueterismo" pero se me olvidaba que Borges es uno de los pocos con patente de corso para drselas de listo inventando neologismos, as que mejor ser callar, que igual no estoy capacitado, vete t a saber...)     Un clsico sobrevalorado ms (y van...). Puestos a tener que elegir algo que lleve el nombre de Borges, creo que me quedo con la famosa marca espaola de frutos secos. Me resulta ms digerible 
 Edge City is obnoxious partially because it is full of lies, distortions, and contradictions, and partially because it espouses an irresponsible model of growth and settlement. I say "irresponsble" because while Garreau claims to be merely descriptive, he's actually prescriptive: he not only argues that ECs are inevitable, but insists that they're vital and wonderful and soup for the human soul. I admit, however, that what what initially raised and finally sustained my rancor is that it's another case of someone simply ignoring the research that has come before them, research of which they are clearly aware, and not bothering to show how their new theory sits with respect to that previous knowledge, or why their new explanations are superior to previous ones.  Garreau makes at least 4 references to Jane Jacobs and her seminal Life and Death of Great American Cities early on in his book - mostly throwaway references, one slightly critical. There's absolutely no engagement, though her work is highly relevant. In LDGAM, Jacobs argues that the basic tenents of urban zoning and planning, which she labels "City Beautiful", are flawed, and destined to create dead grey areas in cities. She advocates mixed zoning, so that the same neighborhood contains at least retail, offices, and residential units, and so that there's significant cross-use and foot traffic throughout the day and night. She also advocates measures in general that are calculated to make movement easier and more appealing for pedestrians, such as shorter blocks, and irregular streets mixed in with the main arterial thoroughfares. Her book is much richer than all of this; this is just a summary of the most relevant parts.  Garreau's Edge City opens up by lamenting the deadness of downtowns and their lack of cross-use, their tendency for single-zoning, etc. He goes on to suggest that his "Edge Cities" (suburbs that have rapidly sprung up over the past 30 years, and which contain a mix of commercial, retail, and residential areas) are not only a good solution to the "problems of cities", but in fact, the inevitable one as well. This would be fine if he talked explicity about why mixed-use zoning in cities doesn't work; why being able to walk across the street to buy milk, take a 20 minute bus to work, walk 10 minutes to a park, and be in the midst of thousands of easily accessible city amenities is so much worse than living in a suburb where you need a car to get anywhere, where you have a 20-minute drive to shopping of any kind, and a 45-minute drive to work. But he doesn't. He makes hand-wavey remarks that humans seek out open spaces and freedom, that a man over 30 who takes the bus every day is a failure, that man seeks to be close to nature, and that urban planners are effete intellectuals who have no idea how real people live. Etc. Again, any one of those propositions would be fine, but there's no data to back it up. The book as a whole is little more than a complicated mess of contradictory claims.  For example, in one chapter, Garreau describes Edge Cities as affordable, but in another he admits that as Edge Cities age, they become increasingly expensive, and "middle-income" people are reduced to paying through the nose to live in what Garreau himself describes as the suburban equivalent of tenement houses. When praising the loveliness and freedom of Edge Cities, Garreau more or less only concentrates on the richest citizens - his interviewees were business owners, vice-presidents, and lawyers, all pulling down upper-middle class salaries at the very least. One upscale couple remarks, "It's really our money that makes us free." (How droll!) Indeed, Edge Cities are great if you're a CEO or can afford a giant house on a 3-acre lot, and at least one car per driver to meet basic transit needs. (And social services are a lot better when you're in a neighborhood where everyone makes several hundred thousand a year: at last, you don't have to subsidize local poor people!) At least, Edge Cities are great while they're new. Garreau describes in several places old suburbs that crumbled and died after they got a little less shiny and new, and their corporate sponsors decided to pick up and build a different plot of virgin land.   In sum, the Edge City phenomenon Garreau describes and joyfully embraces as inevitable is no more and no less than a greedy, unsustainable land grab that will force us to build a lot of unecessary infrastructure (roads, sewers) to places that will just be abandoned in another 50 years. 
 What film did the above (or below) reviewers watch? Sheesh, this thing was all ambiguity (which I endorse, but at some point, there has to be some clarification as to what's going on) - the 'end' of the film is not an ending - it jus' stops - and one of the children has dropped dead - why? Ms. Kerr's (by other reviewers much 'lauded') performance is overly theatrical in the extreme - is she losing her mind? is she completely normal? she acts far too convinced of herself to hint at the possibility of the former - the result being that the viewer is left scratching his/her head, wondering what the hell's going on... and the soundtrack (also described as actually frightening) was laughable - apparently reverb was something the sound feller had just discovered for himself and went all out - to be fair, I don't know what kind of an impression the film would've made on me had I seen it for the first time back in 1961 - no doubt numerous members of the film audience then were indeed 'Innocents' compared to these days of explosions and gore. And there were moments of high suspense - definitely - but to have the film simply be cut off, like a slice of salami... Impertinence! *G*  - apparently, the original James' tale leaves unresolved as to whether the governess was losing her mind, or were the children indeed 'possessed'...?   And where's the ending? (say, another 5-10 minutes to tie up any number of loose ends... what happens to Flora after she went to London? what role does the uncle play really? what does he really know?) - an incomplete and frustrating work... but I can imagine that back in 1961, seeing this in a movie theatre, this could cause some chills... I was born in '68, so am a 'latecomer' in that regard...  An interesting cross-reference that I see - some elements that appear here, even specific questions, are used (I think) to much greater effect in Peter Medak's 1979 intelligent 'chiller', "The Changeling" with George C. Scott - the search for the source of mysterious sounds up up up through an old house - finding a music box in the attic - the question: "How did she/you die?" ---  In short - some promising (and suggestive) moments - but all in all, very disappointing and as I've said, ultimately simply confusing - frustrating 
 Well after purchasing Neaderthin I do have to admit that at least my wallet lost weight.  I digested this Neaderthal treatise over several hours and was left with severe intellectual hunger pangs.  Save your money, anyone who wants my edition can have it for postage (you pay the postage, first come, first serve).  Good grief, what a  waste of time and money!  Well at least learn from my mistake and save yourselves. Don't bother with it, the premise is foolish and the proof merely anecdotal tripe supported by bootstraped deductions.  Be sensible, consume something sensible...perhaps Covert Bailey, among the dozens of worthy authors currently available 
 The Decemberists are wonderful performance art, an exercise in demonstrating just how gullible the indie crowd really is. Will they swallow a precious, pretentious, pseudo-english, neo-prog, ren-faire-reject band that delivers lines like "Meet me on my vast veranda / my sweet untouched Miranda / And while the seagulls are crying / we fall but our souls are flying" with perfectly nasal ernestness?  Will they ever.  It's a 5 star practical joke, making up in success what it lacks in subtlety. But if you buy it, the joke's on you 
 I have read a number of culinary mysteries and I found this one a waste of my time.   Two murders take place - is any one concerned? When I finished the last page of the book -  where was the ending 
 A reader writes: "However, Mr. Sulloway's book is tightly reasoned and supported by a great deal of research."  You might want to look at the discussion of Sulloway's work in Judith Harris' recent _No Two Alike_, pp 92-112. According to that account, Sulloway's work was never published in a peer reviewed journal, the book in which it was published failed to provide the sort of information needed for other people to check the truth of his results, and Sulloway repeatedly refused requests for such data--for instance, the names of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs whose birth order rankings he offers as evidence, or cites to the studies whose results he claims to summarize.   When someone wrote a critical article pointing out evidence that his factual assertions about the data were false, he delayed the publication for several years by the threat of lawsuits.  Judging by her previous book, Harris is a careful writer, so absent some evidence to the contrary my current conclusion is that Sulloway is a fraud 
 I recently lost a lot respect for michael after he said "burn the Mexican flag". How about if we burn the israelie flag. After all it was israel that attacked the USS Liberty and hired that snack Jonathan Pollard to spy on us. But am sure michael would never bring the stuff that I just mention, because in his eyes israel is spotless.   People like him are brainwashing Americans that it is "un-American not to support israel, but has anyone read the talmud says about Jesus. Here's a sample. Read it and ask yourself why are we so blindy supporting israel.    He and his disciples practiced sorcery and black magic, led Jews astray into idolatry, and were sponsored by foreign, gentile powers for the purpose of subverting Jewish worship (Sanhedrin 43a). He was sexually immoral, worshipped statues of stone (a brick is mentioned), was cut off from the Jewish people for his wickedness, and refused to repent (Sanhedrin 107b; Sotah 47a). He learned witchcraft in Egypt and, to perform miracles, used procedures that involved cutting his flesh, which is also explicitly banned in the Bible (Shabbos 104b). Says Jesus ("Yeshu" and in Soncino footnote #6, Yeshu "the Nazarene") was executed because he practiced sorcery: "It is taught that on the eve of Passover Jesus was hung, and forty days before this the proclamation was made: Jesus is to be stoned to death because he has practiced sorcery and has lured the people to idolatry...He was an enticer and of such thou shalt not pity or condone."(Sanhedrin 43a).  Here are two early "Holocaust" tales from the Talmud: Gittin 57b. Claims that four billion Jews were killed by the Romans in the city of Bethar. Gittin 58a claims that 16 million Jewish children were wrapped in scrolls and burned alive by the Romans. (Ancient demography indicates that there were not 16 million Jews in the entire world at that time, much less 16 million Jewish children or four billion Jews).  Pharisaic Rituals. Erubin 21b. "Rabbi Akiba said to him, "Give me some water to wash my hands." "It will not suffice for drinking," the other complained, "will it suffice for washing your hands?" "What can I do?' the former replied, "when for neglecting the words of the Rabbis one deserves death? It is better that I myself should die than that I transgress against the opinion of my colleagues." [This is the ritual hand washing condemned by Jesus in Matthew 15: 1-9].  Rabbi Tovia Singer once said "Jesus in the talmud is neither righteous nor the messiah.  One more thing has anyone heard of the "1919 holocaust that failed". I also recommed reading "the 13th tribe".  (9/7/06)  The anti-black jewish task force once poked fun at Muhammed for getting married to 9 year old girl(I don't agree with that either) But the talmud doesn't seem to think so. Here's what it says.   Sanhedrin 55b. A Jew may marry a three year old girl (specifically, three years "and a day" old.  Sanhedrin 54b. A Jew may have sex with a child as long as the child is less than nine years old.  Kethuboth 11b. "When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing.    Here's some more Sick and Insane Teachings of the Talmud: Yebamoth 63a. States that Adam had sexual intercourse with all the animals in the Garden of Eden. Yebamoth 63a. Declares that agriculture is the lowest of occupations. (Maybe this is why Ariel Sharon's little brother Glenn Spencer doesn't like Mexicans)  Sanhedrin 106a . Says Jesus' mother was a whore: "She who was the descendant of princes and governors played the harlot with carpenters." Also in footnote #2 to Shabbath 104b of the Soncino edition, it is stated that in the "uncensored" text of the Talmud it is written that Jesus mother, "Miriam the hairdresser," had sex with many men.     
 ...clearly an argument that displays first a loyalty to a specific outcome, and then seeks a way to get there.    Rauch does well not to demonize the opposition, who, certainly, can be their own worst enemies when it comes to debating the issue, trotting out canned phrases like "family values," and "the sanctity of marriage."    Nevertheless, his assertion that allowing gays to marry will strengthen the instution misses the point entirely.  First of all, he rightly recognizes that marriage is not just a religious institution, it is a social one.  By legalizing gay marriage--and even civil unions--you are forcing people not only to accept, but to endorse behavior that they find abnormal and morally abhorrent.  Like it or not, marriage is, by definition, the union of a man and a woman; it has never been anything else, until very recently in those mercifully few countries that have legalized it.  Dismissing this fact as a reactionary loyalty to tradition doesn't change it.    Gay marriage probably won't weak the instution of marriage as a whole--it is on shaky legs as it is--but it certainly won't help it.  The state regulates marriage as it is--we are NOT free to marry whomever we want, and just because we might want to badly, that doesn't make it our right.  It is government's job to protect the interests of its citizens, and clearly citizens feel they have a very strong interest in NOT redefining marriage.  And in fact, gays do have the same rights as the rest of us, contrary to what Mr. Rauch suggests.  Gays are free to marry a member of the opposite sex, within the boundaries set by law.  That they don't want to is hardly society's fault, and hardly a reason to change a fundamental social institution, just to satisfy their desires.  His arguments that gay marriage is not a slippery slope remain unconvincing.  If objective values like tradition are so easily discarded to accomodate a small minority of malcontents, then what logical reasons can there be not to accomodate other malcontents? Does this mean that we can realistically expect people to petition to marry their dogs?  Of course not.  But is there really a compelling argument, then, for continuing to outlaw polygamy?  No.  I agree with Rauch regarding leaving the argument to legislators rather than the judiciary.  Most Americans despise the idea of having a judiciary shove its values down our throats, and this more than anything is probably what has given traction to the anti's position.  As a matter of strategy, it's bad for gays; as a matter of policy, it's bad for America.   
 This video is yet another resource promoting a doctrine known as progressive creationism or simply Rossism.  In short, this doctrine is uniformitarian geology and astronomy accepted in its entirety but with God stepping in from time to time to `create' new species according to their appearance in the geological column.  What makes this doctrine so dangerous and destructive are the labels that Ross uses to deceive uniformed conservative Christians into accepting this unBiblical view. The first label that is falsely used is creation.  The term creation is strategically used throughout this video.  Yet what is presented is the exact same theory that secular scientists call astronomical evolution. The universe develops from simple to complex over billions of years entirely by natural laws.   Many people will likely be mislead into thinking that Ross is talking about the Biblical doctrine of creation when he uses this Biblical term.  This is not the case at all.  The Bible says nothing at all of this kind of history.  Creation according to the Bible is vastly different than the Rossism version.  The book Refuting Compromise by Dr. Jonathan Sarfati powerfully demonstrates this.  Perhaps the most misleading of the labels Ross uses is that his position supports Bible inerrancy.   In reality what Ross believes in is inerrancy of uniformitarian geology and astronomy.  That is where he gets his ultimate authority from.  All of his theological speculations are rooted on his complete commitment to virtually everything secular science says about the evolution of the universe.  Biblical hermeneutical rules must be adjusted whenever necessary to fit in secular history.  This of course is not a commitment to Bible inerrancy by any intellectually honest definition.    Sadly, many Christian leaders have been seduced by Ross's teachings and have put in their support for him as a legitimate Biblical position.  It's not too hard to see how this has happened.  Since Ross claims to be a Christian and has strong scientific credentials, it's much easier for him to gain the trust of Christians looking for support for their faith.  He claims to be one us fighting for the same cause.  He uses the Biblical term creationist and opposes Darwinian evolution. And since he has the backing of the entire secular scientific community on the age of the earth, many Christians are cornered into thinking billions of years is a proven fact and must be accepted or else risk being laughed at. Even by supposed fellow defenders of the faith.    The greatest danger that teachings like this risk is a loss of Biblical authority.  By accepting this position we tell the world we don't need the Bible to find answers in life.  Man is elevated as an infallible investigator of the natural world that has all the answers.  This is a step closer to humanism not Biblical Christianity.  In this video the Bible almost seems irrelevant.  Popular science is our authority when it comes to the history of the universe.  What Ross refuses either to admit or acknowledge, is that when it comes to historical science secularists are driven by an ideology that demands a material explanation for all observable phenomena. It's by this same unBiblical ideology that both the Big Bang and biological evolution were born. In the video Ross is presented as an unerroring expert on all areas of science.  He uncritically regurgitates the standard evolutionary order of events that secular science currently popularizes.  Christian laymen are to trust him on scientific issues and adjust their Bible interpretations accordingly.    Again and again Ross emphasizes billions of years as if he was there when the universe was born and saw it first hand.  He makes the usual claim that astronomy directly observes the past.  However it is merely an inference from present observations that light from distant stars took billions of years to get here.  Ross also neglects to mention that the universe exhibits homogeneity meaning that radiation mixing must have taken place which would take longer than the supposed age of the universe. This is a big problem for the Big Bang and shows that explaining light travel is also a challenge for long ager's.  Most disturbing is Ross's claim that we owe our existence to billions of years worth of dead stars.  Without billions of years of dead stars, Ross claims life is not possible.  What sort of god does Ross believe in anyway?  Ross also presents misleading and false claims. He claims no galaxies have been observed when the universe was 1 billion years old (according to the secular time scale) as the Big Bang would predict. However at just 800 million years old massive galaxies and old stars have been observed.  Ross makes the silly claim that life could not exist if the universe did not posses precisely the number of stars present in the universe.  Again Ross's god is limited by assumed evolutionary processes of the universe.  But even assuming the Big Bang is Ross seriously saying that one more star or one less star would have doomed life on earth?  Has he counted every star in the universe and where is his derivation for this amazing claim? String theory is also presented uncritically yet he fails to inform his audience the speculative nature of this theory that lacks experimental support.  At the end of the video Ross presents the testimony of several secular scientists claiming to find evidence for design in nature.  Yet belief in a `designer' or design in nature is not enough to find salvation.  If the Big Bang is such strong support for the Bible as Ross claims why haven't they joined him on his crusade?  It's simple.  The Big bang fits beautifully into an atheistic, pantheistic worldview.  It's fully naturalistic and the arrival of humans is just a tiny blip in history.  Secular scientists see no need for a creator during any part of the Big Bang.  To claim the Big Bang supports Christianity merely demonstrates that one misunderstands what the Big Bang theory is. 
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 i don't care if you like this review or not, but kobe should realize now what he had w/ shaq: the best player in the game, and now that it's his team they are not even going to make the playoffs- and kobe cares too much what the media says about him- blaming everyone else and telling on shaq and his "hush money" and karl malone "harassing" his wife-  shut up kobe and just play your selfish gam 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 I bought this DVD in september, 2006. But I have never received it 
 When it is all said and done about Clinton's Legacy, Gene Lyons has assured himself a place in the Presidential Library by writing such a book. The book does point out several areas that Clinton haters seldom want to  see or believe. For example, regardless how you feel about Bill, you must  admire his ability to not only survive a sad, sordid and disadvantage  childhood but achieved his goals in education, public service and politics.  He did so on his own initiative, using and abusing close friends who also  did the same to him, and focusing on saying anything at anytime that could  help him at that time. Whitewater was a shady inside financial political  deal, made among many politicians with profiteers when the Saving and Loan  sector was deregulated, not just in Arkansas but throughout the country. It  was denied during the campaign and avoided by a phony accounting report  that was needed in the primaries, but proved to be less than accurate after  Clinton was elected president. On one hand, two of Clinton's friends became  upset when the deal went south and felt Clinton abandoned them when he  became president. Now did those friends feel betrayed by Clinton and wanted  to bring him down as the book points out? The author has made a great case  saying so and I believe him. On the other hand, was it the silence of  others who refused to answer pivotal questions whether such meetings with  Clinton took place? This would lead back to the president when he was a  governor and would show he plotted and scheme with them? No doubt about it,  their silence saved this president. Therefore, in the book Gene Lyons wants  us to believe the former but some facts clearly show an investigation was  needed and reported properly by the media contrary to the author's  CONclusions. Either way, 17 convictions including the Solicitor General's  convictions are facts not fiction. The author has been trying to apologize  and justify Clinton's behavior since the impeachment. In the end, no book  using revisionists history is going to exonerate this president's actions  prior to and during the first four years of his presidency that  accomplished more than people expected. At the same time, no book can  change the fact that president Clinton was able to avoid impeachment for  many acts that even his party said can be punishable after these last four  years of absolutely few accomplishments whatsoever. No friend or enemy of  the Clintons' have been able to help or hurt the Clintons' more so than  themselves as well as this book that lives off of a public's poor memory.  The only problem is, when you view the Clinton presidency even after  Whitewater, it is one few can be proud of and the only fool is the one who  claims it had made up scandals to bring them down. Sorry, they did it all  by themselves and still are doing it, to the dismay of the many who support  them, and frustration of those would destroy them. The book is worth  reading to provide an overall view of the Clintons' but it can't change  history 
 Vague, airy-fairy descriptions of the chakras are combined with a decisive, my-spiritual-path-is-THE-spiritual-path primer on the basics of spirituality.  At one point the author describes "wise, ancient spirits" who are suffering very painful lessons so that they can be closer to God.  Do you really want to take spiritual healing advice from someone who projects her own punishment agenda onto the divine (and you!) and glorifies suffering.  Check out Karla McLaren's "Your Aura & Your Chakras."  Like all authors, she has her own issues to work out, but the information is presented in a much clearer, much more neutral fashion 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 if you like nudity this is a good movie no plo 
 Peter Lance is just another sensationalist who spouts misinformation at every opportunity ...hoping to lead you the reader, or perhaps an American seeking truth, down the path of distraction and outright fantasy.  Maybe he took lessons from his previous employer, a CIA controlled TV network ...or maybe Karl Rove of the Bush administration.  Either way, if you really want to know the truth about 911, read some David Ray Griffin, or get one of Eric Huschmid's DVD/videos.  As for Peter Lance, well ...if you have time for fiction and more government spin, then by all means, please help yourself to an extra big serving of the same 
 The things that most struck me was the book was more "attacking" than setting up positive models.  I found the language to be quite inflammatory and harsh.  This made it very unpleasant to read.  For a much better book on house-churches, try "Houses that change the world" by Wolfgang Simson 
 David Barton:  does not know the law. does not know the constitution. manipulates the law to his own purposes. manipulates the constitution to his own purposes. Take a long hard look at his website to see what his aims are. He is whitewashing history in a very questionable and disturbing way. Is this a Christian thing to do? Is it a patriotic thing to do? Stacks of quotes about religion shed no light on the original purpose of the constitution itself. I could just as easily amass quotes from the founders regarding marriage and draw a conclusion that they would have seen it as a forced requirement for everyone everywhere 
 Latour again demonstrates trivial insights and egregious errors. He simply does not know his subject (allegedly science) well enough - he makes conceptual and factual blunders. I am glad this book is still in print  because it is a useful aid in teaching humanity students about science -  but not in the way Latour had envisioned! By understanding his  misinterpretations, we can learn how laypeople get confused 
 I'm not buying this CD because I just found out it's Mortal Coil's track which is missing which completely ruins the whole CD.  That song is SO beautiful.  Why is it not on the CD? That's why I'm giving it one star although the other music used was highly effective 
 I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version.  They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie.  AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married.  Enter the Bride.  She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...  The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions.  Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me.  The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung.  Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress.  So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf.  It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time.  Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie.  
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I have read every novel in the Sharon McCone series and have them all in my collection.  When I found this book at Barnes and Noble and read the description I was giddy with anticipation.  I wanted to read about the relationship between Sharon and Hy as man and wife.  I was very disappointed.  The plot line is basic and good.  A daughter wants to find her mother who disappeared over twenty years ago.  Closure is all she wants although her sister would just as soon let it be.  Thus begins the chase all around the northern California coast, ending in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Whew!  So little time was spent in San Francisco that the office people who I have come to know and adore, were virtually non-existent.  Most of the conversation is stilted and the majority is done over the telephone.  The cell phone being turned off is a recurring distraction.  Is this supposed to have an allegorical meaning?  I don't know.  Sharon's adopted mother and biological mother rate a paragraph or two in the novel.  Hy appears once or twice and I highly doubt that a newly married man would allow his wife to be so distant from him.  Irregardless of their "evolved" relationship, I think it was cold on Sharon's part to proceed on her own when she has such available talent at the home office, just waiting for such an assignment.    My main complaint about this novel is there are two many one-dimensional characters.  I got so confused as to who was who and how they were relevant to the story.  I never got to "know" them and motivations were sometimes so closeted I was in the dark.  There was a very good potential plot in the Mark Aldin/Ricky relationship and yet it was briefly dealt with in sentences.  His death was related by phone call.  (again, the phone)    Hence the title of my review, the point vanished.  I was bored reading the book and just was not interested nor did I particularly care what happened to Laurel Greenwood.  I don't think she was intelligent enough to do what she did and I do not think she was an artist.  I will read the next book in the series and if it presents the same types of problems for me, I will probably give up reading them as I gave up on VI Warshawski years ago.  When you don't like the main character, no point in reading the novel 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 A short book, but too long.  Read like a tract and could have been presented in a long pamphlet.  I generally like Yancey, but you can skip this and re-read WHAT'S SO AMAZING ABOUT GRACE. My favorite 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 There are no sources sited in this book other than ... ' the staff of many libraries gave us invaluable assistance.." 
 We Never recieved this book.  The other one came but not this one.  by the way how can I rate this item if I have not recieved it 
 this scrub didn't moisturize my skin at all. and the salt stings! it seems like it is more of a cleanser than anything and the scent is boring 
 I bought this disc with the understanding that one of my favorite ELO songs Roll Over Beethoven.  Don't waste your money, the version is edited much to my suprise!  Was this done purposely? Why put an edited version of a great song?  There's plenty of room on the CD for the full unedited version.  I wish I could get my money back, whoever decided to put the edited version in should send me $11.98 
 Reading so many of these reviews, I don't get.  I really don't.  In my opinion, this is a major disappointment.  The main plot is incredibly contrived; the subplots are intrusive and unnecessarily complex; the dialogue lacks inflection, pacing and character uniqueness (Connelly should read Elmore Leonard); and the characters, for the most part, are wooden and one-dimensional (Milton=bad, Kiz=good, Janis=loyal, etc.)  Also, whenever necessary, the author resorts to "character facilitations."  Need a spying device?  Bosch has the ideal friend, who can provide him the exact house and navigation equipment.  Need news information?  The ideal reporter owes Bosch a favor.  Need good legal help?  The perfect defense attorney owes Bosch a favor. Need a Las Vegas cover?  You get the point.  I won't even get into the implausible, "wrap-it-up" ending.  It's been well-stated by other reviewers.  As I said, I just don't get it.   
 Simplistic, disjointed and political.  This guy has an ax to grind, and it shows 
 I am an American studying abroad in Buenos Aires and I wanted to advise anyone who is considering buying this book to save their money. I had been using the Time Out guide in the city, which is infinitely better, but I brought this guide on a trip to Colonia and Montevideo because it had much more information. As it turned out, nothing the guide recommended for Montevideo was true or even open. It listed two vegetarian restaurants, one with three locations throughout the city. I spent the better part of a day walking around the city only to find that not a single one of those four was still in existence. I then found a Lebanese restaurant in the guide and walked there, only to find that it wasn't open either. I thought maybe some shopping would improve my mood... but few of the places listed still exist. We couldn't find the reccomended Baar Fun Fun or the Cafe Brasilero. At this point, I tossed the guidebook in the nearest trashcan. At least for Buenos Aires and Uruguay, its much wiser to stick with time out 
 I used to make these during "kakelinna" (time in Norway when Christmas baking begins) with my "farmor" (paternal grandmother).  I still have my grandmother's old cast iron krumkake iron and after trying this one, I will never deviate from the traditional iron again.  Christmas baking in Norway isn't about making a lot and saving time, it's about family.  Although the older ones take longer (but taste better), it is a great time to reflect.  If you have the energy to use a traditional one, I recommend it...the cookies are temporary, memories are forever 
 I read exactly three chapters and gave up in disgust.  Sensationalized & poorly written.  This book is headed to the swap table at the dump.    If you are looking for a well written account of what nursing is really like, read "Life Support: Three Nurses on the Front Lines" by Suzanne Gordo 
 At first this book touched me deeply and got me hoping, but it became quickly clear that the author, with his mediocre storytelling ability, narrow Catholic perspective, and lack of emotional penetration, couldn't handle the intensity of his main character.  Although I was pulled in by the wild Mr. Blue, whose positivity, courage, simplicity, and rejection of all things conventional are quite above the average, he failed to develop as a character and instead grew dissociated and saccharine - like Jesus with all of the peace and none of the sword.    Our world doesn't need another self-sacrificing martyr who has no deep point of view beyond finding joyous pleasure in starving himself to death amid the world's most broken souls.  Anyone who thinks that's what Jesus is about is missing the depth of his spiritual message.  My personal opinion is that the real Jesus would label Mr. Blue mentally ill.  But that said, I still commend Myles Connelly for at least attempting to share his deeper point of view.  Few people nowadays are willing to step out of the herd enough to take that risk 
 I don't expect therapy from a romance novel. These two characters dislike each other - "she's humorless, and  prim", and "he's shallow and aimless." They talk about "having to like yourself" - ARGH. They definitely NEED therapy. She loves him but doesn't think he loves her (yawn), and is generally disapproving of him and only reluctantly admits he is a kind man. (Whoa, hold me back!) Delusional feminist overtones (I am strong, I don't need a man, but my deepest dream is to have a husband and family...),   This is a big disappoitment: dry, no chemistry, the big secret is so anticlamatic...and so much exposition instead of story - just let us live it with the characters instead of telling us everything! Read at your risk 
 I had to read Slave and Citizen for a class in college and I was very disappointed in the book.  I couldn't wait to finish the book just so I would be done with it.  It dragged on and on. I would not have finished it had I not had to.  I would not recommend it unless you are very interested in this subject 
 As someone interested in the Russian Revolution, I found this book at a school library and read it. I was not favorably impressed. Lenin is pushed down to the level of megalomaniac idiot. You don't have to like the guy to try to really explain his motivations or to seek real answers to the questions that bamboozle people. In addition to the pyscho-babble mentioned by other reviewers, I had a problem with Robert Service picking on someone who is to dead to sue him for slander. Robert Service accuses Lenin of shooting down his own Soviet troops (an absolute idiocy in the middle of a civil war).It may be fashionable to produce "exposes" of Soviet leaders, but that doesn't make it a good trend. Modern biographers of the Russian revolutionaries need to remember that Joe McCarthy and his Committee are no longer here to black-list them. In Robert Service's biography, I was upset to find the author judging Lenin through 21st century glasses. By this I mean: 1. Cutting out the context of the Russian economy's ruin during the Civil War. 2. The abject failures of the "democrats"  3. Forgetting what the alternatives would have been had the opposition won (I don't mean the Whites- even the peasants hated them) I wonder what Mr. Service would do if he were in Lenin's shoes...  While I'm wondering, I think I'll go pick up W. Bruce Lincoln's books on how the revolution happened and what happened during and after the civil war 
 The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money.  
 Intelligent Design is, ultimately, an intellectually dead end. This is the large elephant in the living room of Mr. Woodward and Mr. Johnson. What is the practical use of a theory such as this? In what ways does it lead to expanding humankind's knowledge? To simply avoid answering this adds nothing to the "argument" for intelligent design. What great predictions will I.D. give us in the end? I find this history lacking in that it provides no real reason to use I.D. as a productive approach to science 
 I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it.  I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point.  There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better 
 If you liked The One Minute Manager or Who Moved My Cheese, this is the book for you.  If, on the other hand, you believe that Management is a complex art that cannot be adequately covered with fairy tales, this book will annoy you 
 The publishers and Stephen Hawking evidently think they are reprinting Galileo's famous book supporting the Copernican viewpoint, "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems".  Instead, they've given us "Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences", a magnificent book (I use it as a text in my Galileo and Einstein course, see my website) BUT this book has nothing to say about planets or Copernicus -- the furthest object from earth in this book is a cannonball in flight!  It's a five star book, but not if you want to find out what Galileo thought of Copernicus.. 
 Vulgar, sloppy Donal Loge (last seen as complainer in Mel Gibson's film 'The Pa- triot', plays stoner and womanizing slouch,  who happens to be kindergarten teacher (!!),  who gets wake up call while trying to charm  the pants (literally) off John Goodman's real  life wife! He meets his match and learns a few  things along the way. All-American Steve's get looked up to in here; especially Steve McGar- rett! Horay for that, otherwise this sort of dull film would get two star rating from moi 
 One Star is evidently the required minimun. This documentory, in my opinion, distorts the facts and does so for policical purpose and personal agenda.  If you are looking for the truth, you won't find it here.  There are people who, by exploiting the ignorance and stupidity of other Americans, spread mis-information for one or more reasons: for personal or political agenda, or both; and/or, in some cases, such action either aids or supports the enimes of our country. This is a prime example of the type of people who intelligent Americans consider Anti-American as evidenced by the nature of their words, acts, and reasoning. They have a right say their piece and present their documentary, regardless of their motive. CAUTION: Beware of those who intentionally spread misinformation as they have harmful ulterior motives! When a person, organization, or government wants to see America harmed and Americans dead, I, being an American, consider their comments as a serious threat to Americans, American interest and America's security. Americans who doen't consider such declorations as a threat are either stupid/ignorant people or my enemy; there is no third option.        
 This book is so predictable and boring that I couldn't read past Vicky's first trip to America to meet Amber.  I didn't even get to the swap.  And, that was already more than halfway through the book!  I couldn't find myself liking either of the main characters at all.  Vicky over-romanticized everything so much it made you sick, and Amber was living such an exaggerated, spoiled life, it was surreal.    This book was so overwritten and dragged on horribly!  Save yourself time and read a book with some substance.  Leave this one in the store 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here late 
 after i drilled holes near the top of the bucket, as others have mentioned, the popcorn was quite good - and provided enough for our family of five to eat.  the problem we have with this unit is that it overheats after one batch - in reading the owners manual, it even says it will(!) - and there is a cut-out that turns it off until it cools down.  if you only want to run it once, and you can drill holes in it, i guess it's okay.  if you want to supply a family with popcorn for the duration of a movie, find something else that works when used continuously 
 One must begin where it started, why is Jerusalem holy?  The answer, not found in this book, it is not.  Jerusalem was claimed by the Jews to be a place where Isaac was not sacrificed by Abraham.  However this was pure revisionism from the beginning, since by the time David founded his city in Jerusalem, no one knew.  David did build Jerusalem, and two temples did rest above his city.  Herod did built the monstrous temple mount that exists today.  Jesus was crucified in or near Jerusalem.  Mohammed never saw Jerusalem, he referenced 'the holy' which was not Jerusalem but became Jerusalem when it was conquered.  On the temple mount the Muslims found a rock, and claimed Mohammed's footprint was in it.  As illogical as the same rock being where Isaac and Abraham were, this shows how a once faked holy site is then doubly faked.  Pagans faked its holiness to.  They built a temple atop the mount.  The city is holy, no doubt, but the historical facts attributed to it are bogus.  Persecution followed, of Jews by Christians and then of Christians by Muslims.  In 1948 the city divided, Christian students in the city were forced to learn Koran half the day and Jews were forbidden to enter.  1967 liberated the city, for all faiths, despite the authors opinion that it would be better for intolerance to have triumphed and only one religion be allowed sovereignty.    This is a sad disingenuous tale, which does not remark on the idiocy of the very idea of a city being 'holy' to three faiths.  Maybe it is holy to the world?  Maybe the Buddha was in Jerusalem.    Seth J. Frantzman                  
   The plot revolves around a loanshark and his confederates. The cabby/terrorist is really a backdrop to the major scenes but brilliantly done. You actually have to believe these people really exist. The girlie and sex segments are probably the worst I've seen in contemporary cinema. The gore is too much and too long. The actors go from "right on" to miscast.   Perhaps, on a larger budget, this indie could have given Mr. Carter more time for a broader perspective 
 This book was written 1n 1993.... even though the basics remain the same, there are other books on the subjet like the ones written by Myra Savant-Harris that are 100% more updated 
 Slightly above a toy but definately not a sewing machine for anything serious. I ended up hemming my sleeves by hand. Bobbin is loose. Doesn't pull the material through very well. Not at all what I had hoped. I will end up giving this away and buying a real sewing machine. One that will handle a hem. 
 I was unable to view my DVD of Ballet Russes since the message on the screen said - not available in this area - or something like that. I have sent 3 Emails to Amazon to tell them I was unable to view it, and despite the fact they promise replies to Emails within 24 hours, I have heard nothing. So I am not happy at all. I will let you know how good the DVD is when you send me a copy I can view 
 .....buying this or even reading reviews. It is not funny. Only pilot skit is funny, and not enough to justify the cost of the film. I am a die hard fan of John Cleese and Monty Python. The best way to irritate people is by making them spend money on this film. I don't think I have ever rated a film 1 before. There is nothing more to say. I hate to give such a bad review, but, you have been warned 
 The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet  expectations. The description on Native American life seemed  superficial  and like it had no experience or research behind it.  The charachters were  good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went  into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever  spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it 
 While the book has some great ideas and questions our assumptions about how we interact with babies, some ideas of this approach seem odd.  Such as seeing the act of burping your baby as hitting?  Or that rocking your baby is inappropriate?  I very much agree with another reviewer who said this book is written in a "know-it-all" tone, too.  I only tolerate that tone when there is research to back it up.     
 Catchy title, but you'd do better without it. The only thing hidden in this book is the information. Try finding, for instance, the Garden of the Gods using this book; you'll be hopelessly lost and lucky to find your way  back to the hotel. Same for several of the beaches, waterfalls, and so  forth. One has to wonder whether the author actually visited the places  he's written about or just looked them up in other books. There are some  good guidebooks for Hawaii out there, but, unhappily, this is not one of  them. I'd pass on it 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 This book is one of the most trival "works" on the subject known.  I think the author has hitched his wagon the the "creative spirit" train trying to take his knowledge to another level.  Too bad the book is ripe with thoughts and ideas taken from more credible sources.  Pass on this one if you are serious about idea building in business. I've heard the author lecture and that's just as bad. Better books are from the author, John C. Maxwell 
 Let me start by saying I had no less than 4 books I consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide.  This book was a huge disappointment. Not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child (weeks vs. months), but I  found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well.  The book also comes across as very judgemental (baby swings are known as neglect-o-matics & cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween) and gives you things to worry about without telling you why (to soothe a baby you can swing them, but don't bounce!).  I think the book should offer advice and then it's up to me to figure out what to do.  At first I thought it was just me being post-partum and sensitive but my baby is 13 weeks old now and I can see, the book is just not helpful.  Buy "What to Expect the First Year".  It gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do 
 I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department.  As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average.  It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked.  Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia.  Want real 80's metal (not glam)?  Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others 
 This is a play on the classic version on this story. I think the story is akwardly layed out and that there isn't much to it. I LOVE Alison Jay's illustrations, in fact that's what made me decide to buy it. The story didn't live up to my expectations. 
 I couldn't even get past the introduction for this book.  The first part of the intro discusses Anti-Americanism abroad, and the second part proceeds to discuss domestic sentiments.  "Discuss" probably isn't the best word describe the junk printed in this book.  Hollander's "discussion" of domestic anti-Americanism consists of simply quoting various people and labeling them as anti-American.  Because these people disagreed with American policies and actions, they were smeared.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a common response from conservatives--if anyone disagrees with policies, they are smeared and labeled as traitors or anti-Americans(see the reviewer below, who was promptly labeled as a "liberal blowhard" by another reviewer).  In actuality, it is extremely American to question the government, to disagree with it, to protest.  As Americans, we have a responsibility to question our leaders, not blindly follow them.  I was hoping that this book would provide an objective, educational view on the issue of anti-Americanism.  However, the introduction proved to be quite slanted, and I don't think that any of the material in the rest of the book would provide me with the objectivity I was looking for.  Paul Hollander had and opportunity to put together a book that would educate the public, whether they were red or blue, and unfortunately, he botched it.  I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
 This book provides you with the basics of strategies of chess. However the ideas are very basic and the author doesnt elaborate as much as he should. I would suggest getting the "amateur's mind" by Geremy Silman which has the same ideas and is a more robust book. 
 I wish Mr. Gore had imbibed more of a biblical foundation during his growing up years in the Bible belt.  He uses the thesis, that the only thing which creates familial bonds is luvvvvv, to then say that families come in all shapes and forms....2 daddies, or 2 mommies...ughhhhh!  It is no accident that in the book of Genesis, the creation of the familial bond is linked to the sexual act between a man and a woman. "A man shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh." In the New Testament, Paul interprets this sexually, arguing that for this reason one should not sleep with a prostitute inasmuch as you would be becoming "one flesh" with her.  So, the Gores need to repent, return to the biblical foundation, and realize that luvvvvvvvvv is not the sole nexus where familial bonds are released. It is equally in the coming together sexually of male and female.  But then, if he were to say that, he would make certain "families" feel bad. Then he would lose part of his political support. Then he would be called "bigoted" "racist" "homophobe" and "dumb."  
 I liked this workout the first time I bought it as her fatburning workout.  The second time I bought it re-packaged I thought it was a fluke. This time I bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training, so it must be different.  Nope.  I have 5 Kathy Smith videos, all three with different titles and covers only three different contents. I feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company.  One month later and I have yet to receive a response.  
 Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate. I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals. I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!! In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it 
 This movie was SO AWFUL.  What a waste of money.  I love Johnny Depp... but this is SOOO bad.  It is overplayed, to the point where it's just dumb.  It was really boring as well, with no plot.  Really REALLY bad acting, and overplayed 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I was cautiously hopeful for more originality in this release, and disappointed to find very little. I listened to this once and haven't seen the disc since. I appreciated the attempt at writing more songs that involve everyone, not just me and my experience. But beyond that, the CD left me wanting something fresh musically and lyrically, some different integrated musical styles and in general, a sense of diversity 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 The first Schwinn Fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit. The second one arrived but does not work. After calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts (which I did), it still does not work. This is absolutely useless. They will have to do something 
 Stop !  This may look cute, but any amount of playing (even breathing on it) will cause it to fall apart.  This toy did not last a month in our house.  It never stayed together, and on top of that it comes with about 20 teeny tine "grooming pieces" (not kidding, most a smaller than a dime) Definitely a major disappointment for my daughters who love strawberry shortcake and horses 
 This book does have good aspects: the 'content-out' approach Andy Clarke takes, the sneak peak into CCS3 features, and the recommendations for looking at other media and the real world for inspiration. However, it is very poorly edited and contains some bad mistakes. For example: traditionally, when presenting code, newly added lines are bolded. In this book, it is often done incompletely or incorrectly, or lines are left out of the code altogether (check out page 161). Also, one gets the feeling that the good parts of the book could have been condensed down into a more affordable and much smaller book or even a pamphlet. Lastly, some items go underexplained. For example, when introducing the use of attribute selectors, Clarke uses examples such as li[id="cake"], which makes no sense at all, because it still requires an id to be applied in the markup, and actually uses more characters than li#cake. More importantly, though, it does not get to the heart of when and why attribute selectors can be so useful.  In the end, I'd recommend waiting till you can get a cheap used copy of this book, read it, and pass it on 
 I've listened to people rave about this book for years, and being a horror junkie, I couldn't help but pick up a copy as soon as Leisure re-released it.  I tore the cover open, expecting to be blown away.  Did I read the same book that's getting all of the 5 star reviews and adoring cover-blurbs?  I feel horribly cheated.  For starters, the story was propelled by the shallowest plot I've read in horror fiction.  Who are these cannibals, why are they there, what is their purpose, and what has brought them to such a point of unintelligent animalism?  I hope you aren't looking for answers to these questions within the book.  Nevermind the fact that there were no psychological elements behind the killings whatsoever.  This short, bland novel is the literary equivalent of a slasher b-movie.  The characters here were 2-dimensional. Basically fodder to be sequentially killed off.  But that wasn't the worst narrative element.  The writing itself was amatuer, sloppy, and just plain laughable.  Instead of attempting to depict characters in a unique light, the author chooses to isntead bombard us with so many pronouns that we lost track of which "he", "she", or "child" he's even referring to at most times.  Then we come to the gore.  People keep referring to this book as the most extreme horror on the market.  Call me psychotic if you will, but I didn't cringe once.  If you want graphic depictions of extreme violence, complete with fully developed characters, psychological intruigue, suspense, and plot development, let me suggest Michael Slade's "Headhunter" or J.F. Gonzalez's "Survivor".  However, if you still insist on reading this book, save yourself some coin and try finding my copy at my local used book store 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 While I'm sure Lucinda has found a niche with this book and helped others, I would warn those in a deep depression or those struggling with severe anxiety to pass this by.  The book, to me, did not bring the results I had hoped for - it actually made me more aware of the difference between mild and serious anxiety/depression.  If you have been treated for, or feel you have, severe depression there is a chance you may become more discouraged.  Lucinda dealt with anxiety about getting on a plane and speaking in front of people, among other things.  I agree with some posters above that the emphasis is on her experience which held little more than her TV commercials contain.  The skills she suggest, basically positive thinking techniques, were nothing new.   They can be found in other books and magazines.  There were no insights.  Lucinda does not have a PhD and admits to only sharing her experience.  With so much hype about her books, a seriously depressed or person with a serious social anxiety disorder might just compare their pain with Lucinda and find they have have nothing in common and end up sinking lower 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 I did not much enjoy this film, and I didn't find it very clever or funny.   It's true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed.  Along the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn't make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric?  Laura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn't redeem this film for me 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 I did not think that the book would have famed writers talking about their experiences in the world of sports 
 We know Rita Mae can write.  I remember one Thanksgiving years ago reading parts of one of her books aloud to my sisters and all of laughing so hard we cried.  She had captured reality and presenting it wondrously.  This book however shows none of that talent.  Most of the dialog comes across as extremely stilted and unrealistic 
 Sorry but not even my kids wanted to finish seeing this video. They never touch it again 
 I love Philosophy products and own much of the skin care line.  I consider Purity facial cleanser a must have.  I was excited to try the hair care line and was so disappointed after using it.  I thought maybe I should give it a good shot and use it a few times to see if it got better with repeated use.  It doesn't.  It is among the worst shampoos I have ever tried.  It's almost worse than the cheapy store bought brands that you use in dire straits.  It instantly left my hair hard and brittle feeling and I couldn't wait to slather the conditioner on.  Even after condiditioning, my hair was lifeless and tangled easily!    The poor quality of this product actually made me doubt the entire Philsophy line 
 I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks.  I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT" 
 Just a rehash of the manual.  Practical Poser is a MUCH better book that really takes you through the intricacies of Poser 6.  Poser 6 Revealed basically teaches you the same the the tutorial manual does 
 Sure, it looks nice enough without anything on it.  But if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it, pick something else.  It's tippy and it doesn't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off.  It's cheap, but you're getting less than what you pay for.  It couldn't last a winter when being used by only two people 
 This would be a nice addition to the collection of a total Heinlein fan who just can't get enough of the works of a true SF master; otherwise it is merely a collection of cryptic sayings that are better understood in the context of the book(s) from which they are taken.  If you want to understand Heinlein's life philosophy, you should read a variety of his novels.  If you want to see his writing at its finest, read his short stories, especially "All You Zombies".  If you want pithy, useful sayings that give you helpful advice, you should consult to more time-tested sources such as The Book Of Proverbs (the lessons of Lazarus Long were, after all, put in the mouth of a fictional character who increasingly depended on friends with a time machine to pull him out of trouble ... not a resource available to most of you.)  But if you are a Trufan of Heinlein, you definitely need this 
 Initially written in 1966, this survey of 19th and 20th century modern art is defintely showing its age.  Despite five revisions between 1971 and 1993, most of the references to critical scholarship date from the 1950s and 1960s.  I do not imagine this book will be revised again.  The author maintains a rather tradition and connoisseur-bound view of the periods under consideration that sometimes lacks engagement and vibrancy.  It is as if the revolution in art criticism during the 60s/70s/80s never happened.    I don't know the reason for why the period 1880 to 1940 was chosen as the years bracketing this survey, but the result of choosing the 1880 date is that two of the major figures in French Modernism (Courbet and Manet) are conspicuously absent.  The author has also chosen to focus on individual artists, sometimes at the expense of more fully covering art movements and social context within which they emerged.  Images are decently chosen, though small and primarily black and white.  Focus of the text is on established European artists with barely a mention of artists in North America.  Readers might consider the following Open University texts covering similar ground to Hamilton but in a more engaging manner:  Modernity and Modernism : French Painting in the Nineteenth Century, by Francis Frascina, et al. Primitivism, Cubism, Abstraction : The Early Twentieth Century, by Gill Perry, et al. Realism, Rationalism, Surrealism : Art Between the Wars, by David Batchelor, et al 
 If you are in the market for a romantic lesbian love story -this is not the movie to look to.  The movie is 1 hour and 34 minutes long and I couldn't wait for it to be over!  I love Lilly Taylor -she was amazing in Mystic Pizza, Who Shot Andy Warhol, Dog Fight, and most recently made a special run during the last days of Six Feet Under.  As a Lilly Taylor fan you will be sorely disappointed that she chose this role.  This story is about a woman who wants more out of life, but the script is so far fetched in how this transition unfolds.  She goes from minimal, menial high school drop out to physicist student extraordinaire in what seems like the span of a semester or two.  Granted, the time table could have been better in this film, but that's only a very small part of it.  Every single character in this movie is obnoxious and hard to like with the exception of Taylor.  Her husband starts off a sexist, chauvinist and ends the film in much the same way you would just like buy him a clue.  Her children are bratty and always shouting they can't leave the room or scene quick enough.  Her love interest is Courtney Love, and while I love her too -even of late with all of her bad press she's not likeable either.  Courtney Love is probably the worst of them all.  Her character is afraid of change, afraid of being true to herself, worries too much about what other people think of her, wants to be accepted at the cost of herself, and as a result runs back to what is familiar to her and in the end it's okay with her.  The only redeeming quality in the movie Julie Johnson is that Julie Johnson did not want to go back to the kind of woman she was before her awakening.  She never lost her girlish vulnerability throughout the movie, and although cautiously and at times timidly eventually embraced the changes of her new life with admirable, quiet strength.  
   Their first book was actually helpful, and a bit of a novelty. It offered a different approach to cleaning that was geared toward the genetically disorganized, designed by genuine slobs. This was refreshing compared to a lot of the organizational books written by the naturally and freakishly organized trying to feign empathy for their inferior readers.    However, this book doesn't have anything new to say. I felt like I was wasting time reading it because so much of the book was devoted to the authors going into detail about their personal family problems, which really doesn't help the dishes in my sink, laundry on my couch and the Polly pockets on the floor waiting patiently to embed themselves in an unsuspecting foot.   I get the distinct impression that this book was an excuse for them to make more money. But, it does rehash their original ideas, which were all useful. Their first one was their best one, but this is better than nothing. 
 Keeps the drinks chilled but not cold What do you expect for $20bucks Would no buy again. Would go for the more traditional fridges 
 These blank discs are defective. I was never able to record any pictures or audio data to them.  The Maxell blank discs that I have did the job fine. 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 Guenter Lewy seems to have one mission in life: to prove that there was only one genocide in world history, that of the Jewish people during WWII, and that no other ethnic or religious groups have ever been victims of genocide. In recent years, he has been publishing one book after another that attempt to demonstrate that various peoples (American Indians, Gypsies, Armenians) were never victims of genocide. To achieve his objective, he makes a selective use of historical documents, using only the ones that corroborate his thesis, and ignoring those that would prove him wrong. His reading of history is permeated with bias. I recommend anyone to read the negative review of this book by a world-class scholar of genocide, Robert Melson, in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (vol. 16, no. 1, 2002). 
 1,2, and 4 are best leave out 3. Why is the title named Jaws 3-D? Where are the 3-D glasses? I mean the effects are just horrible. I enjoy the rest of the series but this one is just boring. They should re-release this movie in theater with 3-D glasses and I would probably give this movie a good rating but for now this movie just sucks 
 These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much! 
 These guys are the biggest joke in rock music. All of these 5 star reviews are an even bigger joke. Ed Kowizsychik(SP) or however you want to spell it sounds as pathetic as he looks. This is garbage, plain & simple. Im glad radio is no longer saturated with their music. 20 years from now, no one will remember this group. 
 I have not read the original version of this work, but the translation lacks originality and art. A beautiful story, but the writing style lacks grace and creativity. This is the only time I have liked a movie better  than the book. Do yourself a favor and skip the book. The movie is quite  beautiful and moving 
 The book is almost nothing about the garage you already own.  It is about fancy buildings with garage doors to use as offices, dwellings, exhibit spaces, furniture factories, archtectural statements.  If you want to keep your car dry, you will need to build another real garage 
 As future historians begin to ask how it was that the Britain inherited by Tony Blair,  internally secure, economically strong and confident abroad, but yearning for reform at home; turned into the Britain Blair leaves behind - disaffected, facing defeat abroad, with growing inflation and internally insecure, with creeping erosion of civil liberties - they could do worse than turn to this book.  Unfortunately, as an account of the Blair premiership it's neither particularly engrossing nor entertaining.  Described as `vivid' on the jacket, it reveals little that isn't already in print.  Since it relies for its insights largely, as Coughlin himself admits, on high-placed sources insisting on anonymity, we are forced to accept them on a `trust me' basis.  There are minor errors in points of detail which don't inspire confidence. For instance, the UK City of Durham never was a coal-mining city: and it becomes clear that the book is full of apparent statements of fact which actually are assertions: how does he know for instance, that Colin Powell's abortive visit to Israel/Palestine in 2002 failed because `Ariel Sharon had influential allies in the White House who made it their business to ensure that Powell's mission was a failure?'   The book is disappointingly short of authentic personal witness and observation:  something one might have expected from what purports to be a definitive account of a personal relationship between two powerful individuals.  For instance, it's interesting to compare Coughlin's account of the 2002 dinner at the presidential ranch at Crawford Texas at which, according to Coughlin, Blair `wore a black suit out of respect for the recent death of the Queen Mother' with Sir Christopher Meyer's vivid and much more entertaining personal witness - much rubbished by Downing Street - that on arrival at the dinner Blair had to dash away and quickly change since mistakenly he'd arrived wearing jeans.    Nevertheless, 'American Ally' may offer some clues about the causes of Britain's decay under Blair, offering as it does an exclusively Blair-centric account of his relationship, first with President Clinton, then with President Bush.  Beginning with the moment when he declares, " We are a leader of nations or we are nothing", this neo-con Utopian masquerading as a socialist ('...With my class background I could and- lets be blunt about this - would have joined another party....')came to Downing Street possessed as none of his predecessors - save one - of the power of his own belief.  The well known high mutual regard between Blair and Margaret Thatcher is once again rehearsed here. The memory of Thatcher's success in the Falklands made a big impression on Blair, reinforcing his will when, early in New Labour's term the Kosovo crisis catapulted him to a platform from which he was able eventually to orchestrate the defeat of Milosevich, dragging the US under Clinton along with him only at the cost of public and Parliamentary opposition leaving him personally at times dangerously exposed.  But Milosevich fell and if today Kosovo remains unstable, the adventure brought peace of a kind leaving Blair with a sense of the correctness of his own judgment powerfully re-inforced.  Kosovo and the Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement were Blair's finest hour.  From the moment of Clinton's defeat, Blair made it his mission to forge an equally strong relationship with George Bush.  The first so-called `Colgate summit ` is once again recounted..  From their first meeting, it is clear that Blair's well-known talent for appearing to agree with each person he meets - whatever their opinion - played a large part in persuading George Bush that here was someone he could work with.  For his part, Blair seems to have been progressively deluded into believing that the things he had to say were in fact carrying weight with the President and his team.  In fact, not even his much-promoted insistence on the problem of Israel/Palestine seems to have had much effect on the course of events there.  Its interesting to read that Ariel Sharon's decision to withdraw Israeli troops from Gaza and pull out of certain settlements was actually negotiated by Elliot Abrams- a leading neo-conservative brought into the White House to work on the `road map'- in Blair's complete ignorance; while in the Rose Garden Bush continued to insist on Blair as `America's staunchest friend.'  As chaos and killing in Iraq grew and spread following the fall of Baghdad, Blair's dismay at the trap into which his personal determination had lead the UK and its military forces grew.   The Abu Ghraib scandal, says Coughlin, compounded Blair's deep sense of betrayal at the way the Bush administration handled Iraq.  A  `Downing Street aide' is quoted;  `....we all came to the view that we would never embark on another venture like this with the Bush administration.'   So that's all right, then.   With so much instant history already available on the tragic partnership of Bush and Blair its hard to recommend this one, comprehensive though it is. Readers seeking a more balanced and insightful account would do better to turn to `The Accidental American: Tony Blair and the Presidency  - James Naughtie's recent masterly account of these crucial years.  Those with a taste for something more anecdotal and racy will enjoy DC Confidential, the account by Sir Christopher Meyer of his years as British Ambassador in Washington.   With its portrait of a firm-jawed leader of principle standing shoulder to shoulder with his principal ally, and then, in spite of personal suffering, bravely resisting public and Parliamentary disapproval as he struggles to `complete the job', 'American Ally' reads like a dossier to accompany the job application which Blair is presumably already making to the lucrative American lecture and foundation circuit against his coming exit from Downing Street.  And for Con Coughlin?  To paraphrase a well-authenticated proposal from Blair himself to the British satirist Rory Bremner:  "How does Sir Con Coughlin sound?"  
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 Why when there are talented writers out there with original ideas, do people never see their work and continue to produce this kind of crap? Luv Mom 
 If you love the O'Malley Series, don't even pick this one up.  The depth, and character develpment so wonderfully dispalyed in the O'Malley Series in missing in this book.  It seems the author was rushed, and didn't get a complete story prior to publishing 
 Be carful where you place it...MUST be put in a shady place or it reads crazy! Hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously can't be seen at night 
 Someone recommended this guy to me as a profound thinker.  I feel badly not liking the book insomuch as I like some what I have read *about* Krishnamurti, especially his repudiation of insitutionalized belief systems.  This guy was bought by a rich British woman and raised to be a demi-god.  See [...]  It is laudable that he rebelled. When examining the content of this book, however, there's nothing I haven't read before from more compelling and less pompous sources.    Perhaps I am jaded, but this read like an awful lot of rehashed Hindu-Buddhist brahmin babbling, formulated for the "searching" western man, "searching" so often for a a father figure, in this case in the form of an approachably handsome and elegant western-educated guru. I know, I know, he said he didn't belong to any caste or religion, but really - just look at the content.  Yes, he has some twists on what constitutes chastity, for example, but it is so trite ("chastity is nothing without love") that I just couldn't take it seriously.  Perhaps it is the format of the book, but within a few minutes of browsing I discovered a number of contradictory and maddeningly condescending statements.  "Do you understand?", "I hope that you will listen" is pompously peppered throughout.    Krishnamurti undoubtedly meant well, was abused by weird cult practitioners in England, and was a physically beautiful man - but is he really much of an original thinker?  There was certainly nothing poetic I could find in this book either.    Ugh 
 I wish Amazon had partial stars to give. These two prove it's not what you know but who you know in order to get published. They have taken others information and added their own (every other word profanity) that does nothing to bolster their feeble attempts at being authors. Just go to the end of their "book?" and jot down other author's names and websites that offer the same information these two are trying to impress you with 
 After getting this guide I was pretty disappointed.  It DOES have fairly good suggestions on what the individual units do, but the descriptions don't go much past the ones provided in the manual that comes with the game.  After the unit descriptions the guide provides basic guidelines on how to win each race's single player campaign, broken down into phases just like the game.  What I was most looking for however, were tips on attack and defense strategies, as well as tips for multiplayer.  This is where the guide is lacking, having only a few pages worth of tips unlike guides for most other RTS games that I have seen.    To sum it up, unless you are having a hard time completing Supreme Commander's single player campaigns, this guide delivers very little that the game's instruction manual does not already provide. 
 (i am not a native speaker, please overlook my style) i am not going to review the novel, i simply love it. this edition was quite a disappointment to me: the box and the over book-cover are lovely, the pictures are exquisite; the book cover and the binding are rather of a poor quality but still better than the paper used and the printing which are untolerable for an edition as expensive as this 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 This book is less a book of instruction and more a series of exercises for a would-be writer to perform.  I was kind of disappointed. I mean, going in, I knew that, say plot and character and dialogue were all important. I was hoping for some sort of discussion on what makes a good plot, or a compelling character, etc. Instead, Josip merely says (roughly) that "Having good characters is important. Here are some exercises for you to write characters: 1) Take a person you know, and describe him. 2) Imagine that person's total opposite, and describe him. (Etc.)"  I've enjoyed other books more when they've discussed what makes a good character versus a bad one, or a good plot, or good dialogue, or what have you. This collection of writing prompts wasn't what I was looking for, but maybe it's what you'd like? If so, recommended 
 I am not too impressed with this book, nor its author, Donald Oliver, with whom I had the "priviledge" of taking a series of his classes.  His book, and consequently, his methods, are far too rigid; the guidelines in the book are presented to the reader as if they are the ONLY way to do an audition, and if you don't do it HIS way, you are wrong.  He even provides a list of songs NOT to sing.  However, I believe that a successful audition is not about following a set of rules, but rather what works for each actor.  A song might be overdone, but if one can do it, and do it well, then, by all means, do the song.  Additionally, Donald Oliver is a pompous, arrogent man, who "name drops" to try to impress his students, and believes that his way is the only way.  Do not buy into the "rules" of this book.  If you must read this book, only use it as a reference.  I recommed the book "NEXT" by Steven M. Alper instead 
 I got this book from a well meaning spouse for Christmas 2005.  I have been a Parrot Head for the last 7 years.  I did not like this book.  The only part of this book that I found worth reading was the part after each album's review, the author wrote a few paragraphs about what was going on in Jimmy's life or with the record companies at the time that the album was recorded and released.  I found the historical background interesting.  The second part of the book was devoted to reviewing the books that Jimmy has written.  The reviews were way to long and to me, seem self serving.  Other than that, not worth your time.  
 I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play 
 The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution 
 is this guy putting us on? all his albums sound the same and the reviews do as well-if your not hip enough or intellectual enough than you can't understand this deep moving experience. stick to music you enjoy, not what your supposed to "understand"-this music is for the few people recording it, not those who want music than can experience and feel something from 
 The author appears to be educated on the subject, however as I am someone with no yoga or pilates experience it was too hard for me to follow & understand the steps she's recommending. This book definitely needs a DVD to go along with it. It was too hard to hold the book, read step 1, understand step 1 and then do it to move onto step 2. If you are well trained in yoga/pilates then you might have an easier time with it, however I think this book would benefit ten-fold if it came with a DVD 
 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
 Here I thought I had the perfect book for my upcoming journey from Boca Raton to Sarasota via I-75.  It arrives today and I search the pages for I-75 in Florida.  What a downer! I can't understand why the author did not complete his work for the entire distance of I-75, instead of ending it at the Florida-Georgia border. Perhaps he ran out of gas. No matter - Tomorrow I'm returing this book to Amazon 
 Unless you have a need to be told what you already should know, unless you have an undying interest in the bloody obvious, you might want to think twice before spending your "wealth" on this one.  There is about a page worth of information in this book, but it is a marketing miracle.   It would be interesting to know, just how many readers managed to hook a  rich fish with the bait provided here. Skip it, and invest your money 
 Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.    If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.   
 All textbooks over $50 are a rip off, WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR STATE SENATOR TELLING THEM YOU WON'T STAND FOR THESE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES ON TEXTBOOKS FOR SCHOOL.

 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 Hardly being a serious look into the (supposed) simulated world, Simulacra and Simulation unnecessarily confuses, compounds, and over-estimates the reality of simulation, and implies simulation in virtually everything while failing to give any real evidence or examples for this phenomenon. Through and through, Baudrillard fails to adequately define his terms, concerns, and sources for his critiques. While never settling on one particular point, his arbitrary method of critiquing never moves beyond the realm of opinion. Critical analysis of the subject matter (whatever that is) is never applied, instead being sacrificed for ever more obscured superficial observations. Baudrillard gives us no example as to the cause of his concerns (whatever those may be) let alone giving us any real solutions as to how we may pierce through our alleged self created illusions. Nor does he give us any real insight as to how these critiques can be applied in any useful way to our education or our daily life. If this is what is passing for philosophy today, I can only imagine how useless the field will become in fifty years if we continue to look to Baudrillard as the top of his field. Superfluous and meaningless double-talk is all you will get out of this useless excuse for a book. For anyone interested in reading "Simulacra and Simulation", I would sooner recommend Dr. Seuss "Green Eggs and Ham." You will have more fun reading it, and you will probably learn more as well 
 I gave this book 2 stars because it is historically significant to understand the thinking of the gender feminists of the 1960s.   I also found the discussion of the equality feminists from the 1800s to be interesting. The right to vote for women was of course important as were several other causes that the equality feminists fought for.  I rated this book low because the author attempts to explain the housewife phenomenon but ends up overgeneralizing and trying to speak for all women. The author is very snobby and self-rightous, thinking she is able to determine which women are really fulfilled and living their life to it's fullest potential. The ideas in this book are what caused people like my mother to talk negatively about "dumb housewives," and to eat their words when their own children, such as myself, grew up and became...housewives (or what we now call "stay at home moms." Which, I might add was mostly fueled by watching my workaholic mother (who I do love very much) who didn't seem to enjoy anything in life...except work) Fortunately, we can teach our biased and prejudiced mothers that some women really do get fulfillment from raising their own children/homes.   I am only going to touch on some of the ridiculous arguments in this book, because there are too many to list:  Ms. Friedan gives "evidence" that children in other's care actually turn out better than those raised by their mothers. Great. So, she was teaching a generation of women that they are better off working than caring for their own children; that other people can do a better job than they can. What a vote of confidence.   The author goes on and on about how mothers were smothering their children, and this is why many turned to a life of the "feminine mystique." Sorry, but a 1950s mom with 7 children and a lack of modern conveniences did not have time to smother her children. Basic care for as many children as women had in the 1950s would consume most of a mother's time. If you want to see parents who overwhelm their children with attention (and material goods) and live vicariously thru them, look around in 2006.  According to the "research" (and I use this term lightly because someone as depressed as Ms Friedan must have had trouble seeing the happiness in others) in this book you are either: 1) WORKING MOTHER- mentally stable, able to do household tasks in lightning speed and raise completely competent children. 2)EDUCATED HOUSEWIFE- most likely on drugs and/or are alcoholic, are so depressed you contemplate suicide, have dysfunctional children and a husband who is trying to get away from your sexual advances. 3) UNEDUCATED HOUSEWIFE- content with life because you are a complete idiot.  Ms. Friedan completely ignores that there were (and there still are...) a significant percentage of women who WANT to be at home caring for their families and homes. I'm sure there were millions of women who were benefitted by being emancipated from their homes. That is good that they were happier with more choices. However, Ms. Friedan should have encouraged them to do this without dragging millions of other women thru the mud.   With her chapter on the "sexual sell:" I'm glad that she figured out people make money thru advertising by manipulating people. Advertisers manipulate everyone, not just women. And, I am sure the "thing-buying" housewife of the 1950s was nothing like the guilt-ridden working or stay at home mom today who's child has so many toys he/she doesn't know what to do except claim, "I'm bored" due to being so overwhelmed.   p. 85: Ms. Friedan quotes someone who says, "To make one half the human race consume its energies in the functions of housekeeper, wife and mother is a monstrous waste of the most precious material God ever made." The fact that Ms. Friedan would even give credit to this comment by citing it in her book speaks volumes about her mentality.   When I thought the ideas in this book couldn't get any more rediculous, Ms. Friedan started talking about homosexuality...The Feminine Mystique is driving men to be gay! Men are so repulsed by their over controlling wives and mothers that they are turning against women and "turning" homosexual! Also, Ms. Friedan thinks housewives are sex-crazed zombies in search of any man...and finally this comment: "I am convinced there is something about the housewife state itself that is dangerous. In a sense that is not as far-fetched as it sounds, the women who "adjust" as housewives, who grow up wanting to be "just a housewife" are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camp..." Is this woman serious? This stuff is so warped I can hardly put it into words!!  It is my opinion that this author was 1) extremely depressed and/or had psychological problems 2) was insanely jealous of happy wives/mothers. 
 Films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag.  While never my favorite genre, the stakes have been raised in recent years.  With sophisticated outings such as "Batman Begins", "X-Men 2", and "Spiderman 2" and "Superman Returns", it seems that we've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art.  These films surprised me and entertained me (as any movie should), but also utilized real drama, intelligence and adult sensibilities--often with great performances and smart, logical scripts.  Even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films.  So "The Fantastic Four" is a throwback.  Far from sophisticated, it plays as a live action cartoon.  That might be OK, but the more pressing problem is that it's not particularly fun either.  I know a lot of people feel that "The Incredibles" borrowed heavily from "The Fantastic Four" concept, and maybe so.  But at least on film "The Incredibles" was rousing entertainment.  Maybe the film "Fantastic Four" should have taken that cue.  I won't blame the actors.  I actually like many of them (in other roles).  It's a lackluster, sloppy script.  The filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows.  First and foremost, they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience--kiddies included.  And I can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from The Human Torch and The Thing.  Their interactions, after all, are the equivalent of junior high taunting.  But it's just not funny enough, the effects aren't original enough, and it sure lacks a brain.  Put the small kids in front of it--it's harmless enough, but you probably don't want to invest your time with "The Fantastic Four". 
 This mystery went on way too long, giving you way too much time to easily figure out who the culprit was.  Very predictable, no character development, and I won't be revisiting this series 
 this, to me seemed a copy of this authors previous books the same old same old. I attend Oxford  and as an exchange programme I had to pick one author actually the aut was picked for me. I personally dont enjoy reading the  experiences of someone who is writing fact as fiction. then I met the  author at a book party and she was so haughty and unapproachable, to a  female  but all eyes to the males .....if you know what I mean. Luckily  that same week I met  Styron and William  Buckley, so my time here in the  states wasnt a total loss 
 Great price, poor product. They are beautiful upon arrival. I washed them according to manufacturer's instructions. You would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer (usually a sign of poor fabric quality). While folding them up, I discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed. And I hadn't even used them yet! Unbelievable. I returned them for a full refund, including shipping (and I stupidly purchased 2 sets). Goes to show you get what you pay for. Never again 
 "Dog Days" isn't interesting for its characters or the plot, which is chick lit meets roman-a-clef political satire.   Indeed, the best parts of the book come from a few lines where the characters observe life in Washington for the political/media elite.   For example, one character had a great take on why 40-year-old men in DC date twentysomething interns. Another describes what a Washington cocktail party is REALLY like. Later in the book, another character muses on the effectiveness of President Golden (read: Bush) "pushing Mom, flag, apple pie, pickup trucks and mortgages" during his re-election campaign.   "There's a whole generation of young people who live a life based on absentee parents and McDonald's vegetarianism, credit card debt and one-night hookups," the character says. "They're entering the professional class now and their mores and norms will define the new middle class."  This remark would have made a more interesting essay to read than passing dialogue in a novel. I think this book would have been better if the author threw out the fiction and stuck to full-length essays in the style that made her noteworthy in the first place.      
 I purchased this back in 1982 for £13.99 ( a fortune for an unemployed 20yr old back then) as a Japanese Import.  It was my most eagerly awaited and most disappointing music purchase ever. A limp performance, Gary Barden just didn't seem to cut it(apparently he wes too nervous facing 10000 at the venue and his vocals had to be redubbed) and Michael Schenker was good but below-par. In my opinion, there is nothing to recommend this album, the tracks sounded better on the two studio albums-it is certainly no "Strangers in the Night". One for completeness of collections only 
 I wish they'd pull this one from the market. I've never heard a soul say anything good about it. It's just out there so Patterson fans will accidentally buy it. DON'T BUY IT!! It is nowhere near the quality of any of his other books! Get ANYTHING else by Patterson and it will be better than this 
 Although I "listened" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's "Into Thin Air" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 I love Le Carre and was looking forward to this film.  But what a mess!  The plot is a mishmash -- after about an hour I no longer cared what might happen to the protagonists.  Excellent actors like Ralph Richardson and Anthony Hopkins are wasted in secondary roles.  Other reviewers say that this movie was edited to death and I believe it.  Save your money.  Maybe they'll release Spy Who Came In From The Cold on DVD some day 
 This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough 
 The U.S release is a far cry from the original,and more of an insult than anything else.I can tell everyone though,for a fact that the original theatrical release (spoken in original Mardrin&Cantonese&subtitled in English) is the S&^%!?*^!.It's not only entertaining and hilarious,the fight scenes are absoloutely INCREDIBLE.So,if you get the opportunity,buy the VHS tape.I did about 6 years ago,and although it's not dvd quality,it's still a fantastic film.I suggest checking out EBAY for it on DVD,you may be surprised and find the original out there?This is a MUST HAVE film for any Jackie Chan/Martial arts fan.It's a perfect blend of action and comedy.I suggest staying away from the editied/dubed U.S release,it's been butchered...find the original,it will be worth every penny even if it costs a bit more 
 Maybe it's me, but I think that if you're writing a light-hearted mystery with a lot of one liners and some characters who are so exaggerated as to be basically comedy relief more than real people, maybe you shouldn't punctuate it with scenes of grotesque violence.  There are descriptions of acts in here that reminded me why I was never able to read "American Psycho"-- really appalling, hideous stuff.  And yet the book is clearly a comedy.  I just couldn't reconcile the two aspects of the book.  There are some other problems:  I saw the major twist coming from around page two-- Konrath uses a gimmick that should be retired by now; it's been done so often that it just leaps out at the reader.  Jack Daniels repeatedly acts in ways that violate any willingness  to suspend disbelief: she knows that she's targeted by a psychotic who's torturing people to death, you'd think she'd take the situation a tad more seriously.  This is the first book I've read by Konrath, whose jacket blurb conceals his/her gender, a move about as coy and pointless as much of the book.  I seriously doubt I'll ever read another 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks. 
 When I got the book I immediately turned to the part of the book about the making of Michael Jackson's megahits. So for what its worth this review is based on only half of a chapter. But my God the writing is amateur, filled with redundancies and bizarre typos (the man who recorded "Thriller" misspells his own smash record as "Billy Jean"). But the worst part is that instead of being rich with fresh anecdotes and useful production tips based on this milestone record, all I'm finding are annoying, half tossed off thoughts, devoid of insights (not to mention, God forbid, juicy gossip). He tells us Vincent Price was given three verses for his "rap" but they only used two, and that the third is "in my tapes somewhere." Hello! Could you take a quick look, please? A first look at unused material would have been a real treat, but instead we're told useless anecdotes about his dog refusing to growl for the intro to the song. Yawn. This book feels like the unedited notes of a non-writer who's just been awarded a book contract 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 This book disappoints on so many levels that it is nearly pointless to catalog all of it's faults in brief, but I'll give them a quick try.  Starting with the title, "Mysteries of the Middle Ages"... catchy isn't it, makes you think of DaVinci Code and wonder what those "Cults of Catholic Europe" were up.  Guess what, you'll never find out, not in this book.  What this book is instead is a quirky basic general survey of what historians call "The High Middle Ages" or the "12th Century Renaissance" written by a non-professional historian.  Cahill doesn't discuss any 'Mysteries' whatsoever (that I can remember reading anyway) and instead devotes his attention to giving vaguely humorous depictions of some medieval personalities.  Unfortunately the author suffers from a limited attention span and constantly digresses, and bears a very apparent grudge against most degreed 'professional' historians, and an outright hatred of Republicans and President George Bush that colors every chapter he writes.  Yes, you did not misunderstand... the author regularly interrupts his commentary on some medieval event to make sarcastic comments about a modern US President!  The author does this CONSTANTLY.  Italy good = America (especially Texas) backwards and immoral.  Yawn.  This is not history - this is just social revisionism with a specific political agenda. Avoid this turkey!  I recommend instead any of the books by Charles H. Haskins "The Renaissance of the 12th Century", etc, or other more recent works by C. Warren Hollister or Malcolm Barber. 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review 
 The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back. Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa. Thanks. Jeanne Alle 
 The book was for a friend.  It came in "new" condition and is being enjoyed 
 The big problem with this book is that it continues the story of Ragnar Blackmane as it was begun by author William King. When i finished reading just the first chapter i found myself wondering if the author of this novel even liked the subject material being written about. In no other Space Wolf book do the forces of the Emperor begin the story so close to crapping themself in fear of Chaos Marines. The point of Space Marines is that they are brainwashed into believing they are the end all be all of destructive power in the universe. Everything that is not of the Emperor is not something you fear, but instead something you despise. Within the first chapter the author has explained how Space Wolfs know themselves to be inadequate in the challenge of facing Chaos Marines. At what point does Ragnar the berserker of the Space Wolves doubt his unstopable nature? That is the very reason that Space Marine chapters have Chaplains to weed out those who doubt the power of the Emperor. All in all this book was a disapointment from start to finish and i pray that William King returns to pick up the pieces, or at least someone who is familiar with his work and can do a better job of staying within established characteristics 
 I was waiting for this dryer to come in the mail for a while now.  I looked forward to using it.  Yesterday, I got it in the mail and used it.  I thought with the attachment, it would be more convenient to straighten my hair, not true.  I used it for 10 minutes and it shut off on me.  I waited 10 minutes for it to cool and start up again but it never did.  I will not buy this product again.  Do they manufactures think that it takes only 10 minutes to dry hair?  They should have tested this dryer out before sending out into the marketplace.  I am very disappointed 
 Lots of common sense. A few good insights. But all buried beneath mountains of endless repetition. Simple ideas obscured by turning them into psudo-mathematical formulas. Endless repetition. Dozens of made-up acronyms. Did I mention endless repetition. Of the same ideas. Repeatedly. Author laments no room for specific case studies, which might have actually given some color and life to the book. Of course there was no room for real-life examples. He was too busy turning simple ideas into obscure psudo-math and impossible-to-follow diagrams. Repeatedly 
 justifaction, santification and holiness, are all linked to one thing the finished work of christ. guys like this say we are justified by faith but were are pertty much on are own when it comes to living the life of a christian.1 the 5;23  eph 5;25 and many othe rscriptures state that we are present tense justified, santified and glotified. by any effort of our own. o foolish jerry who has bewiched you. you stated in the spirit are you made perfect by the flesh.surrendering of the will not will power is the key to the christians walk. only god is holy. how do we become holy, the same way the temple became holy Gods Spirit resided there, "whos temple you are." he says he tried the let go and let god method of holiness and failed, so it was false. he then says try his method but do not be discouraged by constant failures and setbacks. read hebrews 4 and do not try to do it but trust god and apprehend it for yourself. by faith and faith alone. brother stop laying burdends on others you yourself can not bear.               
 This book was required for my CULA 101 class and i found it very hard to understand some of the terms used in the text. I know the book was translated from french to english, nut i feel that the book is on a level that on professionals of the highest ranking can understand. I would hate  to say it, but if you "dummy down" the book, i am sure more people would be able to understand it 
 I read a LOT of books of this genre (and admit to liking chick movies as well), but here's the thing: just because the character is a single 20 or 30-something on the lookout for love does not a story make.  This genre is so popular that the criteria for a story must be low...sell, sell, sell!  The characters are SO FLAT I didn't even care if they got together.  Their relationship was based on sex (we get NO dialogue hardly at all between the two), so why should we root for this affair?  The only character who is vaguely interesting is the "other woman" (his actual wife) and I didn't like her either.  Not only do the characters need depth, but the story draaaaaags on and really doesn't take us anywhere.  There is no richness to the setting.  It's all just cookie-cutter boring.  There is hope!  If you want some good chick lit with character development, try getting some Fiona Walker books and skip this one.  Marian Keyes is fun too (except for Angels).  I just find it hard to identify with an adultress with no personality, I guess!  Please don't waste the money and borrow it if you insist 
 Terrible.  With so many good, REAL stories out there, how could there ever be a market for a 'fable'?  I should have read the fine print.  This is not a true story, but instead, a made-up mess.  Yuck 
 A killer for a local mob boss, who is also the goon's surrogate daddy, kills his way through a long tedious book.  There is time out for a little love interest with a woman who understands and aids his need to sow lethal mayhem whenever his "daddy" tells him to. Bloody meaningless shootouts (not fully explained), continue as the Miami mob trys to take over "dad's" Orlando territory.  Our hero starts looking for "dad", who has gone missing, with lethal results for scores of unknown and meaningless characters.  Its a one dimentional tale that never caught my interest.  Unless you enjoy keeping track on your abacus of an ever rising body count with no interesting tale attached, give this one a bye for your own good.  Life is too short to waste your time on books like this 
 There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others 
 This guy is totally out of touch with reality.  He is trying to rewrite reality so that the we give HIM power through the money he hopes we will spend on his book.  Don't make the mistake of buying this book and don't make the huge mistake of following what he writes.  There is no need for power in life.  Especially at our ages.  We need peace and happiness.  We can get this by a walk in the woods.  Don't loose the rest of your life by running after happiness where it is not.  Happiness is inside yourself, try to find it before looking elsewhere.  It will not come from anywhere or anybody else.  Get peace with yourself instead of creating chaos.    All chapters are poorly written with bad advices 
 I bought and read this book and found it to be a superficial treatment of the subject for Christians who believe in a single God, which I am not.  I finished the book hoping for a deeper understanding of guilt and forgiveness after experiencing the recent suicide of my only child, a seventeen year old boy suffering from severe depression.  I am sure this book will be comforting for those it is written for but it did not shed any light on the subject for me 
 I understand why the Beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. They only made about two decent songs in their "Hey Jude" a pretty song, and "Ballad Of John And Yoko". The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's "Down By The River". I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music. Here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs 
 It is NOT worth the money. It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn't shoot. The BBs fall out the front. It jammed like 6 times before it broke. This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all. It sucks a lot. Don't buy any products from HotImport Toys, they are cheap, worthless, and extremely breakable 
 Former Philadelphia newscaster Larry Kane scrapes the bottom of his memories of covering The Beatles and few encounters with Lennon afterward to pad this combination of memoir and hagiography.   Kane covered the Beatle tours as a radio reporter and his book about them, "Ticket to Ride," is considered an excellent fly-on-the-wall account. Here, he takes his material, what little information he's gathered, padded it with bombastic praise for the group and nearly everyone who knew or worked with them then tacked on 33 pages of fan letters. Kane is besotted with Lennon and uncritically takes his side whether John is using his rough tongue on his friends, cheating on his wives or behaving badly while taking copious amounts of drugs and alcohol.  Kane wraps the Beatles in fulsome prose that would embarrass the most hardened egotist. The Shea Stadium concert? "An epic moment in contemporary entertainment" Onetime band mate Stu Sutcliffe? "In the formative years of John's march to eternal greatness, Stu Sutcliffe was a colossal figure." Even Beatle experts aren't spared this trowelwork, with one authority called "the world's greatest scholar" on the group. This fulsome praise makes for hard reading.  Kane's prose settles down when he describes the private moments he shared with Lennon while on tour, and there's a wonderful section describing the weekend Lennon spent in Philadelphia helping Kane's station with its telethon in 1975. The accompanying 40-minute DVD mixes a promotional interview with Kane with a 13-minute interview from 1968 with Lennon and McCartney, and a few seconds of Lennon giving the weather report as part of the telethon promotion. So while there are some interesting bits, it wasn't enough to justify a book. As they say in the record business, I didn't hear a hit 
 I bought this to add to my growing collection of etiquette books, but it's less a book of etiquette advice (no real guidelines) and more a book of brief, isolated observations about what kind of person aspiring ladies would like to be ("A lady always knows when to X," "A lady will know how to Y").   Forgive me for pointing out that someone purchasing this book probably already has a fair idea of these kinds of things. That's why they are trying to learn how to become a lady.  The text is sparse, very large and highly stylized with wide margins. It's cute for a coffee table, a gift basket, or other decorating purposes, but if you're looking for an etiquette guide to know HOW to become more lady-like, this book is not for you.  For a catch all reference work, invest in a relatively up to date version of Emily Post's, Amy Vanderbilt's, or Laeticia Baldridge's etiquette books, the first being my favorite. If you'd like something more anecdote/situation driven, try the Miss Manners books by Judith Martin 
 I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  I have always enjoyed Frankenstein's monster.  He probably is my favorite classic horror icon.  I have seen a lot of different Frankenstein films; some of them are cheesy, but fun.  I also have watched different versions of Mary Shelly's book and I enjoy them all, some more than others.  This film's plot takes a kind of continuation of Shelly's novel with some name changes.    First of all it is extremely drawn out.  The plot just drags on with very little action or real character development.  The monster is very basic looking.  He has very little scaring, and is not very big or intimidating.  He is just a basic 6-foot man with semi long hair wearing a hood.   Doctor Victor Helios is an interesting character; basically he has been keeping himself alive for the couple of centuries trying to replace humanity with a superior race.  The monster is his first prototype from the eighteenth century who is trying to stop Helios. The whole idea of this film is pretty original, but it just was portrayed in a very slow and boring way.    I just had a very hard time making through the movie.  Finally the film just ends and the viewer is left with too many unanswered questions.  What was keeping me from giving this film 1 star rating is other reviewers of the movie stated it was a pilot for a television show that was going to air on USA network but never did and fell through. Finding that piece of information helps me understand why the film just ends without any real closure.  Also the cinematography is done well for a made-for-TV-movie.  But this film just does not stand well on it's own.  The idea was in the right place but it just did not work right at all. 
 From the favorable reviews, I assumed that this would be an informative book.  However, this is not the case.  I learned very little in the course of reading the book, and here is why:  The laws are obvious.  Anyone who has ever been part of a team and given even a little thought as to what elements make a team function well will be unsurprised by the list.  The reason that the author says the laws are "indisuptable," is that the laws are so obvious that anyone can see that they seem to generally hold.  Don't waste your time with this book.  Instead, check out "First, Break all the Rules," which is an innovative work that addresses management issues (including teamwork) 
 I bought this for my 43 lb, 6 year old daughter for Christmas. The BACK FENDER, MAIN BODY, HEADLIGHTS and the RIMS are made of CHEAP PLASTIC. This toy was broken on the first day she rode it. The back rim and the back fender cracked and broke making the bike useless 
 look, its not really that book about the transition to capitalism in America you wanted to read, its boring schlock about congressional political trivia in the National Era.  Go read Dobbs, and when you get to be senior faculty fire this man. 500 pages too lon 
 I picked up the Dutch translation of Todd's recent book for 5.60 Euros at the discount bookstore "de Slegte" (the Bad One), and after reading it on a sunny Jamaican beach I feel that it belongs in the dump store indeed. It is a badly informed book, which summarises French, and general European leftist prejudices about the United States.  First the controversial title: "After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order". Are the USA really an Empire comparable with the Roman, Macedonian, Mongolian, British, French, Turkish, Soviet and other empires, where one people completely dominates and exploits a number of smaller ones, mostly their neighbours? I don't think so.  Certainly, the US has quite a few imperious characteristics : it dominates the world economy, it has a quasi monopoly on new technologies, American-English is the common language of the civilised world, and it is by far the strongest military power. But this is not a result of a history of persistent conquest. It is the result of America's fundamental strength which has no equal in this world nor in history : the American love of freedom, and the consequential rewarding of the entrepreneurial spirit which exists also in Europe and some other regions but to a far weaker degree.   Todd's analyses are based largely on demographic evolutions and some vague productivity statistics. Low birthrates are no serious indicator for economic or political decline. They are just an indicator of women's willingness to have children. If a family has to live in a cramped appartment, if the mother needs to work outdoors to pay the rent and has ready access to birth control means or abortions such as in Russia, it is realistic to assume that she would want few children or none at all. Sweden has a higher birthrate than France or Germany because of numerous incentives for parents such as parental leave without loss of pay. South-America has a very high birthrate mainly with the poor but no political scientist claims that it will dominate the world in any way. China has a one-child policy but also a booming economy. Where is the link with the future fall of an Empire ? In rich countries, modern hedonism is also an important reason for women not to have children : having fun is the only reason for life.   Todd completely ignores (political scientist as he is) the dominating importance of technology in the modern world, and I daresay, also in ancient history. A better historical book on this subject is "Germs, Guns and Steel" by Jared Diamond. World history is much less driven by philosophy and religion as Todd seems to think but by practical things like steel knives and swords against stone axes, gunpowder and canonballs against hordes of naked savages, smallpox against vulnerable Indians, and GPS guided bomber planes against Iraqi foot soldiers.   I do not understand Todd's argument that America's productivity is declining. Probably the US produces less textiles, shoes, steel and potatoes than say China, but microprocessors, laptop computers, electronic instruments, software, airplanes are mostly produced in the States. US unemployment is lower than anywhere in Europe. The reason that America imports low-tech goods is simply because there cheaper for the customer and the shopkeepers earn a better profit on them than from local manufacturers. In all statistics I ever saw US productivity was among the highest in the world.   The US are not interested in occupying countries like Iraq, Vietnam, Korea. Their interest lies in a pacified world, which does not threaten their main business of making money and hopefully contributes to it like "conquered" Germany and Japan, pacified Europe and Russia, and developing economic power China.  Americans are no crusaders. They are not interested in converting Muslims to Christianity. But they truly believe that democratic institutions are essential to guarantee their Freedom and the World's.   Comparing America to Athens instead of Rome is more appropriate, albeit that Athens never militarily dominated its mediterranean world as Rome did, and America does today. Like Athens , America dominates the world thanks to its democratic values, science and technology. Eventually Athens was defeated by Sparta. The US could have been defeated militarily by a united communist world. The debacle in Vietnam seemed for some shortsighted analysts and communist ideologues to be the beginning of the end of capitalism and the downfall of America, followed by worldwide communist rule. It did not happen. First because of MAD : Mutually Assured Destruction by the American and Soviet nuclear arsenals. And then in the long run by the collapse of communism, because it was unable to compete technologically, economically, culturally and ideologically with the free democracies under loose America leadership. Recent history has simply proven that political democracy, a free market economy and consequentially capitalism, are superior in almost all aspects to communism and a planned economy. China is in a transition phase from communism to full democracy. It's economy is gradually more deregulated leaving room for private initiative and capital growth but not (yet) political democracy.   Will the United States' New World Order collapse like the Soviet communist bloc ?  I don't think so.  The European and Asian countries liberated  or "conquered" by the US have grown rich and free, and I would say "happy" whatever that means. The countries occupied by the Soviet Union became unfree, poor and definitely unhappy under iron Soviet rule. They voted "with their feet", emigrated in large numbers whenever they could. Unhappy people will cause unstable governments.  The Roman Empire lasted almost a thousand years in the West, starting from Rome's humble beginnings, until the end in 453 AD. It lasted almost a thousand more years in Constantinople, until it's downfall by Turkish conquest. The Romans did rule their empire with an iron fist. But compared to barbarian anarchy the Roman society could be called civilised and relatively benign. There must have a lot of content if not necessarily happy people in the Roman Empire. Even among the slaves.   Judging about America's militarily prowess Todd asserts that the US only picks on little countries in what he calls "theatrical" wars. Todd sounds like a corrupt scientist who fixes, fiddles and ignores experimental data to make them fit with his favourite theory. He has apparently forgotten that the US has beaten Japan with very little help from either the Soviet Union, China, Britain or France for that matter. It has defeated Germany right on time when it was already severely weakened by the Soviets. It has helped to finish off the Spanish Empire in Latin-America. It has won her Independence War against a world-dominating British Empire.  It has "lost" in Vietnam for lack of democratic support at home.  I see little "theatre" either tragedy or comedy in these feats.  Wars of aggression are often lost because the attacker underestimates his victim. Japan severely misjudged America's strength and will to fight and attacked Pearl Harbour. If they would have been more prudent, the Japanese Empire might still rule Asia and more... Napoleon misjudged Russia and lost his Grande Armee to the Russian General Winter. Hitler repeated Napoleon's mistake, but then he was only a corporal trying to command generals. Todd is not qualified to judge on America's military prowess, but he could at least stick to the universally known facts. Except for Vietnam (arguably) America has never lost a war !   Another major mistake Todd makes is that he considers Europe to be one power, of course dominated by the notorious French-German axis, which by itself is dominated by France. This notion is simply ridiculous. "Europe" as a political unity does not exist and will not exist for the foreseeable future, in spite of all the efforts of the European Union's bureaucracy. The idea of an United States of Europe was glamorous and popular in the sixties when there were only six member states. Not anymore. Already two states, the Netherlands and France itself, have rejected the so-called European Constitution by referendum, and more are bound to follow. Only the Spanish popular vote has accepted the Constitution. It is meaningful that "Europe" is very popular in countries receiving large EU subsidies, and much less in countries which are paying them. Many Europeans are getting thoroughly pissed-off with the bloated EU bureaucracy, overpopulated by overpaid (tax free!) often corrupt  and always arrogant Eurocrats trying to regulate just about everything down to the size and curvature of bananas.  I don't think that the EU can ever be a tight political unit such as the US, Japan, China or Russia, which are rather or very monolithic. The heterogeneous Soviet-Union could not last without extreme suppression of the population. Several countries in Europe (Spain, Ireland, UK, Portugal) feel more affinity and familiar relationship with North- or South-America than with their neighbours. On the contrary, almost all European countries have a history of hate and continuous warfare with their neighbours. Hate does not disappear in a generation. War crimes can be forgiven but not forgotten. Germany is still hated by all nations which were occupied by the Nazis, and by the Kaiser before that. Napoleon's massacres have not been forgotten.  The admission of Turkey, a traditional archenemy of Europe and Christianity, to the EU might well be the last insult to the Europeans that will split it up.  Some political thinkers credit the EU (formerly known as EC or EEC) with keeping the peace in Europe since WW II . This is a major mistake and a grave injustice to NATO, led by the USA, which has kept considerably armies, navies and especially air forces and nuclear forces permanently on alert. The Soviets knew that they could not just march into Western-Europe without severe losses, and eventually a direct conventional and nuclear confrontation with America. Todd ignores this because it does not fit into his politically-correct frame of anti-American prejudice.  When visiting the US on business or tourism I'm always impressed by the long lines at immigration. All those immigrants, voting with their feet, can't be wrong!  Todd claims to have predicted the fall of the Soviet-Union years before it happened. I will read his book on that subject to check this. It looks as if by now predicting the fall of the American Empire he wrote a sequel to it. Posing as a professional prophet is a risky business. Some people are predicting the fall of the European Union. I tend to believe the latter will happen rather than the former.   I conclude that Emmanuel Todd is a fashionable political "scientist" following the  leftist politically-correct line which prevails in Europe among intellectuals. He writes what he thinks that his audience would like to read, not what the facts show.  He does not write political or historical science but political fiction bordering on propaganda, along the long line of Marxist tradition.  The origin of the anti-Americanism of Todd and writers of about the same age probably dates back from the boisterous "sixties" with their anti-Vietnam-war demonstrations, student revolts and the rise of  "gauchism" (leftism) . The former student "street revolutionaries" are now comfortably installed in academic teaching positions and government jobs. They feel homesick for their lost youth and try for the last time (hopefully) to rekindle the zeal and appeal of the Roaring Sixties. This includes anti-Americanism, and pro-Russianism for lack of a Soviet-Union, pro-Cubanism and pro-Chinaism. Excuse me for the ugly "ism" words, but that's how Marxism, Leninism, Fascism, Nazism, Gaullism, etcetera are discussed in intellectual circles.  Buy the book anyway preferably from a dump store, but read it with a wary eye, and compare it  with the true and missing facts. Then get angry at it and write a review paper. Unless you are a Euro-leftie of course.  
 Reasons why I do not like this potty:  1) The shield falls off with one touch, ussually into the potty! 2) The potty has many cracks and crevices in the bottom that collect pee in numerous ways. 3) It is cumbersome to empty the potty. 4) Once the shield is lost (since it impossible to keep attached) it is hard for boys to sit down and not make a mess.  I highly recommend that Bjorn potty since it is all one piece and with a built in shield 
 Una interpretacin absolutamente falaz tanto de la historia como de la filosofa poltica. Un sinsentido que lamentablemente ha tenido enorme repercusin en la formulacin de polticas desde el imperio hacia la "periferia". Un deseo de teleologa desde la imposicin del poder. En fin, hay que leerlo slo para rerse un rato con tanto absurdo. 
 It's rather amazing how a book that has so many facts in it can be so consistently limited in its ability to capture the really important stuff about a place.  Two summers ago we used it to pick campgrounds on our trip down the coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles and were disappointed to find coastal campgrounds that rated an "8" on Stienstra's scale, only to find that they were essentially located in the middle of parking lots.  True, the book says that the number represents only a "scenic rating," but you'd think that campground's immediate surroundings might merit a mention.  Likewise, I just returned from a trip up north where I'd planned to stay with my two kids at a campground that Stienstra rated a "7" and had a description that stated it was "within easy reach of I-80 yet is in a beautiful setting"... with a "gorgeous stream."  In fact it was in such easy reach of the freeway that you could literally see and hear the cars and trucks passing two stone's throws away. Was that mentioned? No. Is that my idea of a campground worth going to? Absolutely not.   If you want a book that simply tells you how to get to a certain campground, what amenities are available, whether dogs are permitted, costs, reservation information, etc., this book is exhaustive in its scope and undoubtedly useful.  But don't, don't, don't, rely on it to give you a sense of the place.  There are much better books out there for that.  One we like:  "Northern California's Best Family Campgrounds," by Roland de Wolk (Chronicle Books)

 And why does he write a lamebrain neanderthal book every 6 weeks? And does anyone REALLY read him?   Factcheck much?  Utter tripe 
 I agree with Pinkerton, description very misleading. I want to return this for the same reason!!!  Says its good for walking, riding, etc.  Yea, with a loooooong extension cord! Doesn't run on batteries! only car DC or AC 
 The book was about a girl named Jennifer and a toad that she bought from a magic shop for a school  project about pets.   The only thing she did not know about the toad was that the toad,bufo, could talk.   I would recomend this book to people who like Fairy tales , or books with  magic. The characters in this story are Jennifer ,Ellen, Mr Elives, Sharra, Skippy, Brandon,Mrs.Murdley, and Bufo the toad.   My opinion of this story was that it was not so good but ok. I thought the book was boring 
 How adorable this film is.  John Lithgow is brilliant.  I love the scene when he is throwing all the McDonalds hamburgers at the beast.  Catch of the day!  This movie means something to John.  His name is John "Lith", his name is John "Lith."  I wonder if Johns little babie son ever acted again hahaha.  
 This book has not been updated for the new microwave ovens of today. Although the recipes are satisfactory the cooking times can't be used. The food would be cooked into a brick. Needless to say, this book should be rewritten 
 Carter wins on giving us numerous minutia about Blount's life and his odd selection of friends. But her book was not of great interest to a reader who was aware of Blount's peculiar nature and interest in art. It is difficult to understand how Blount or his friends, seemed completly oblivious of politics as Carter has laid out. Unless she is making the case that Blount was the perfect mole - at all times on guard against exposure. But I don't think she is trying to make that case.Carter gives us a blur of names, quotes, and a failure to find mention of expected comments in corresspondence such as the passing of Blount's father. It may be Carter's intention to show Blount's world as an extremely focused life which was hardly influenced by outside events; such as the end of World War One and the rise of Communism. I suspect Carter is trying to explain Blount as a Good Boy Who Does Bad Things 
 I love the text book! It's one of the most useful texts in my library. I even had the 1995 CD-Rom version for my practice, and it was indispensible while on house calls. But the 2005 edition sucks.  It won't work on my Mac (although the disk case says it should), uses a windows-only proprietary format that won't even search properly, has non-standard user controls, useless help files, and is basically unusable. Steer clear of this CD version and just buy the book 
 I had the good fortune of going to college during the prime days of the Columbus, Ohio hip-hop scene, so not only have I been a fan of RJD2's almost since the beginning, I used to go see him spin on a weekly basis. That being said, I can tell you this album is exactly the sort of music he's always wanted to make. The only problem I have is the songs aren't very good.   No one's going to argue RJ's proficiency as a beat composer or producer. He's also shown a high degree of competency in the art of creating a song. However, none of that skill is on display on "The Third Hand." It's not that the music is horribly offensive or that the songs lack structure, it's that he foolishly chose to build the songs around his vocals. RJ's vocal abilities flat out suck. As wonderful a producer and as nice as a guy as he is, it pains me to say that, but it's true. His vocals are frequently out of tune - bordering on screeching - and are horrifically off key. His vocals sound like a ferret is being tortured, and while I don't know what that sounds like, I don't imagine I'm far off.  I'm all for artists experimenting and taking chances, it's why I bought the CD after reading bad review after bad review. However, what artists like RJ and his contemporary, DJ Shadow, don't realize is over the years their stage names have taken on a certain branding by their audiences. Just as I wouldn't expect to pick up a Jack Johnson CD and expect to hear him singing Frank Sinatra songs, I don't expect to pick up a RJD2 CD and expect to hear RJ screeching and wailing for an hour.   Honestly, if, hypothetically speaking, Jack Johnson wants to sing Frank Sinatra like songs or if RJ wants to sing folk songs, I'm fine with that. I just expect the new material to be on the same level of quality as the songs they've been putting out for the past 10 years. In RJ's case, the songs on "The Third Hand" aren't as high in quality as any of the work he's put out in the past. RJ, we know you're capable of more than this. "Making Days Longer" off of "Since We Last Spoke" is a beautiful song that will stand the test of time as long as "The Horror" or any other song you've made in the past, but nothing on "The Third Hand" even hints at the genius that was on display in either one of the former two songs. 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 By the cover you would never know it is a ( VERY Poor) piece of fiction, written as if an adolescent was given a high school assignment and was just passed an article about Royal Rife the day before. I'd say someone owes me 10 bucks, but that old adage of a fool and his money soon being parted,  keeps running through my mind. 
 I studied this book thoroughly and then attempted to make a pair of plain pants that FIT.  I've been sewing for 40 years.  I did not get a pair to fit, and after 6 muslins, bought PANTS FOR EVERY BODY.  The problem was, I have specific, difficult fitting issues - flat, low seat, small waist, big thighs - which this book does not cover.  So, if all you need to do is add width or length, this book is probably ok.  It sounded great in theory - slide, mark, trace - but in reality I could not even come close to a good fit in pants 
 You get what you pay for.  Don't bother with this at all.  My car charger did not work at.  See other reviews on the problems w/ the leather case.  Save your money 
 The Truest Pleasure was written before Gap Creek was but I just happened to read Gap Creek first. I picked up a copy of The Truest Pleasure because I absolutely loved Gap Creek. Let me save you some time. Gap Creek and The Truest Pleasure are THE EXACT SAME NOVEL. Only this time it's Ginny instead of Julie. I'm telling you people Robert Morgan has recycled his story The Truest Pleasure into the Oprah's pick Gap Creek. I'm not even exaggerating. The only difference besides the characters names is that instead of a great life endagering flood in Gap Creek there is a great life endangering fire in The Truest Pleasure. People if you have read one book I promise that you have read the other one. I finished The Truest Pleasure feeling totally ripped off for spending twice as much money on the same book. Don't waste your time. Robert Morgan is a gifted writer and he has a true knack for telling a wonderful story. The only problem is his creative abilities. He can't seem to find a different story to write so he just decides to recycle one story into another. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME 
 This novel should remain forgotten in the dim past.  It's a period piece, all right.  Blatantly antisemitic -- and I don't think the author was making a comment on his characters in that regard; I think it was the author speaking.  Boring in stretches.  Long stretches.  I finally gave up and heaved the book across the room.  Out of curiosity, I read the author's Butterfield 8 a number of years ago and, trust me, it's worse. 
 What's wrong with this show?  1.  Jim wears the same pants, coat, and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series.       2.  A slow, sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums.    3.  Won't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her?  4.  Do you really believe that this middle-aged, heavy fellow would drive a Firebird - a tight fitting car?  5.  Angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Slow, boring reading.  I kept waiting for it to get exciting but it never did!!  There is very little real 'meat' unless you are interested in becoming a hollywood makeup artist 
 We've all seen detective series that gradually petered out as their authors obsessed with their characters and forgot that, first and foremost, you need a mystery to have a good book. I loved the previous Falco books, and Davis continues to have outstanding historical detail and character development, but I'm afraid that this plot isn't worthwhile. There's more excitement in Helena's pregnancy than in the breakup of a incipient olive oil cartel, and Falco doesn't seem to solve as much as blunder. Here's hoping that this effort was an aberration 
 It's a comic book.   This book was very disappointing.  I had watched the movie and thought that I could get more insight by reading the book...I think that I was done in 10 minutes reading...  Terrible to even market this as a book 
 Interesting reading to a point. Evidently his first work as it lacks detail in many of the episodes and experiences. In some places it is very rambling and wordy. His early training skips detail that is important. He moves from early boot camp as a private to his first command and then suddenly he is an "agent" in the military intel group and refers from that point on as "ther officers" etc. What happened to OCS? Take a test and skip to officer country in counterintel? At times it reads more like a social diary than the spook insider it is supposed to be. He relates every dinner and association he had with  agency officers and dignataries but neglects what he did while in these locations. As an example, where did he work or what office was he attached to while in the Congo? Details of his reconstruction --a complete chapter-come in the middle of the book after explaining the air crash which comes after a period in Laos that is not detailed until the later part of the book. If he was at Long Tieng for any length of time, a guy could write a very big novel just about the people that came and went through there. I'm glad to see that he received the kind of medical attention that all Veterans deserve from Walter Reed. 
 I should have listened to my sister, the vet tech, instead of people who swear by this stuff. I see no noticeable improvement, but it was worth a try. Next step Valium............for me AND the cat!! : 
 This is by far, without a doubt, the single-handedly most God-awfully, hideously sterile, boring piece of literature ever produced by mankind. I have heard a rumor that hospitals are going to start making patients read this book in lieu of anaesthesia before conducting surgery 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 I like this author, but this story falls apart under the weight of a not too well thought out mystery. Plus the characters are so diverse it seems impossible that they would be in the same story, and have no conflict 
 I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term "nigger in the woodpile" in quotes or not does not ride well with me.  I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout 
 You may love your kids, the smell of a newborn baby, and finger paintings, but Bill Keane's trecherously unfunny and maudlin anthology is unbearable. While it is clear Family Circus contains neither razor-like wit nor social commentary, the offensively poor quality of Keane's humour will be come inevitably clear as you turn the second page. After 40+ years of writing this comic strip, surely Keane's capacity for humour is no longer what it once was. However, astonishingly, upon viewing Keane's first Family Circus comic in the 1960s, it became clear that there never was any humour in it. No 
 In principle guru's experimentation on jazzmatazz is a good thing.  The variety of guest artists adds diversity and originality to each track, and gives the cd a distinct jazz flavor.  However, there is one problem with the album: guru really isn't a very good lyricist.  His rhymes are boring, simple, and formulaic.  An example from "take a look at yourself": "In there gettin funky with the track/I used to drive a cadillac/it got me there and back."  As you can see, the lack of diversity in guru's delivery makes for a fairly bland album, despite its experimental nature and promising direction 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 As a licensed private pilot I have often dreamed of doing just what the author did, i.e. rent a vintage airplane, take a whole summer off and fly around the entire United States. So, when I saw this book I bought it immediately and settled in for a vicarious thrill.   Unfortunaely, the author describes almost no contact with the local people and only passing mention of the scenery he flies over. His mission apperars to be simply to touch down in every State and then fly on to the next airport; mission accomplished. He lands, goes to a nearby restuarant, has a hamburger ("it was good") and flies on.  There are many writers out there who have traveled the USA by motorcycle, car or boat (see William Heat-Moon's "River Horse")and have managed to write a fascinating account of their adventures. This book is very cut and dry and left me wanting more. Maybe someone will take the same trip some summer and write a book worth reading 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 I've studied and drawn fashion illustrations for more than 20 years. I'm familier with the history, the artists, and the techniques of this genre.  Most fashion illustrations serve the purpose of either selling clothes or giving directions to people actually making the garments. Short of that, they've been used to present a fashionable illusion for p.r.  I'm not sure what purpose of the often very abstract illustrations in this book are supposed to serve. They aren't glamorous. They aren't drawn well enough to sell or direct in the creation of garments. Perhaps they were intended as decorative illustrations at either point-of-purchase locations or on websites.   Either way, I found the enclosed illustrations lacking in imagination, verve, and technical skill. This is the first book I've ever returned to Amazon. 
 Ugh!  Just use the "Search Inside" tool and read some of the "Surprise Me" pages, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  (You can re-click "Surprise Me" to bring up other sections but only one or two extra times.)  Anyhow, this lady just tries to incorporate her religious theology into practically every page, and it gets real old real quick.  So, just consider yourself warned.  Unless you like the idea of aimlessly seeking "spirituality" in EVERYTHING, including my (yeah, you know what,)  ~cough cough pantheist cough~ you're not going to find yourself connecting with the book very well, or the rest of the world for that matter -according to the author- not to mention, you'll come back as a flea when you die.  Pardon, all the sarcasim, usually that's not like me, but the way this author tries to push/infiltrate HER philosophy is a joke!  And one I can't excuse -and one that shouldn't be overlooked by others who want to learn the pure facts about plants/herbs. 
 Having read several other books on out-of-body and near-death experiences, I was at first drawn into the tale that was being woven. That came sharply to a halt when the author depicted Jesus speaking to a group of departed souls in sixteenth century English. Give me a break 
 Recordings sound like they were all done the same day, in as little time as possible, with the least amount of studio talent.  Terrible 
 There are just some trilogy's that should not be made - and the Wild Things trilogy is one of them. This is not really a trilogy per se, since each of the films carries with it the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first, you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough.  I am sure you all know the story by now, but here is a brief synopsis... "Things get steamy in Blue Bay, Florida, when Marie, a 17-year-old beauty, gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double-crossing after meeting the promiscuous Elena, the new girl at school. Will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme?  If you have seen one of the Wild Things films, you have seen them all. This film lacks the quality of the original - mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come. This disc does look great, and sounds pretty good, but the film takes away from the overall DVD presentation. If you want your Wild Things fix, the original version is the one to watch 
 This book, and the IFG group in general, do not offer an alternative to capitalist globalisation, which is the real problem, not solely globalisation.  While subsidiarity, or localisation, is an important concept that should be considered and implented in any alternative to capitalism, this book misses the point that capitalism is the problem.    This book operates on the outmoded and illusionary idea that Adam Smith's capitalism, local capitalism, can be achieved and will provide an opporunity for fairness and equality.  Capitalism can never be this way, as it is by nature expansive and anti-local.  This book leaves out the perspectives of many concerned social actors such as Indigenous people and women.  It provides the view of a very narrow selection of the anti-globalisation movement.  This book is dangerous and subversive in that it appears to offer a viable alternative to the exploitation of the current economic world order, and so activists will work toward this reform of capitalism, and in the end prolong suffering and exploitation. The only way is to end capitalism and explore alternatives that are noncapitalist(and perhaps anti-globalisation as well) in nature.  SMASH CAPITALISM 
 I didn't like Keep Right album at all and i was very disappointed. 
 Half-hearted adaptation of Ernest Haycox novel is weak.  Scott is good as Owen; Knox is equally good as the baddie, but the film is missing movement.  If there were ever a Razzie award at the time, it would have to go to the  title song 
 This was a useless purchase -- the sound is filtered through the TomTom and not through the speakers of a vehicle as expected; why would anyone run their iPod through the TomTom when the sound is barely audible.  In addition, it is hit or miss whether the iPod's music is in fact filtered through the TomTom 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 You need a plan, and its going to take work. No Kidding? You need an image. REALLY? When you submit items, you may get turned down - NO?!?! This book is ok if it's your first on the subject, but if you have ANY kind of marketing knowledge, skip it. I came across one idea that I thought, HEY Never thought of that. I had to force myself to finish it. Not enough examples of a press release's or other items (but you have tp PLAN, AND SPELL CHECK - WOW!). He has a chapter on the internet, that again is for the beginner, and almost a beginners guide to html. How about where to promote on the Internet? One positive is the author availability. He publishes all sorts of ways to contact him. It was easily read (although I was frustrated by the end as it wasn't giving me what I wanted). He explains how you can take a press release, reword it, and re-release it. I got the feeling he did that with each chapter. (Sorry Jeff) 
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 Carly Simon's the only one worth watching on this DVD,but she's only in  the film for 69 seconds,and her only line is "I read that Sh-t you wrote about me."and thats what this movie i 
 While the action was okay and moved along, the characters never enter the magic place where you care about them.  You keep hoping this will happen, but the ennui is relentless.  The end of the book is highly forgettable.  I know this because I read it last week and can't remember the end!  I do not go to movies.  I read and buy much more pleasure when I buy a book.  I am sorry I bought this one.  I think it is a way to capitalize on The DaVinci Code stuff.  (At least that was interesting and semi-educational 
      I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to "create" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in "Rilla of Ingleside." There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is "Christine," the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to "steal" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book.  
 This is a very scholarly, theologically oriented text.  It is very dense and focuses on comparison of different biblical texts, language interpretations and corroboration through ancient literary works or histories.  It is not the inspirational or devotional text I was seeking,  but may be a delight to serious student of theology and biblical studies 
 The book talks too much about the author's life and his father.  Very little about the games.  Some of the material is based upon interviews with former Colts that were conducted for the author.  Some of the information about the Colts before 1952 (when they were the Dallas Texans), and particularily the Colts of the AAFC I had not heard before, but it makes up just a few pages of the book 
 John Hagee pockets around 1 million dollars a year. I wonder how much he sends to Darfur to help the women being raped instead of sending it to Isreal to try and help his theory of (whoever is in with Isreal, is in with God)  If you could do one thing better than GOD, would you still believe?...............  I would like you to imagine for a moment, a mother's love. I think we can all agree, the bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest bonds known to mankind, in any time or culture. Now imagine you are the mother of two children. One boy and one girl, their ages are unimportant.  Got the image in your head? Great, now imagine one child is always a troublemaker, quite a little heathen if you will. The child never listens to anything you say, gets in trouble at school, and even sometimes says they hate you. Child number two, is a perfect little angel, always does what they are told, hugs you and kisses you often and whispers their love for you every night before they fall asleep.   Of course you may discipline the naughty child, but do you still have unconditional love for both children mommies and daddies of the world?   Of course you say?   Well let's see..........  Late one summer night you decide to go to the corner store to buy some milk after the children have fallen asleep, upon returning only ten minutes later you are horrified to see that your house is engulfed in flames. Knowing both children are inside, and could be burning alive at this very moment, you know you need to make a quick judgement. Which child will you save??????  What ??    Both you say?   Why would you save both children?????  What?? Because you love both of them??? Why?  One child is a complete terror, and doesn't even love you!!! Why would you do such a thing???  The Christian God wouldn't!!  What you say??? God has unconditional love, even more than a mere human mother?  Really????  Well, let's take a look at the GOD of love for just a moment...  God has many children in this world yet he punishes those who do not love or "believe" in him, with fire for ALL ETERNITY does that sound like unconditional love to you???  If I, as a mere human mother, can love my children with the unconditional love that GOD cannot, does he truly love and forgive better than us "silly" humans that he supposedly created?   Or are we all just ignorant children, hoping that our "father's" approval (with strict unrealistic conditions), equals love?  You decide... Can you do something better than God?  What you say, if he didn't love us he wouldn't have sent Jesus to "save" us and forgive our sins? We'll believing in Jesus is still a condition isn't it? Something to think about.  Ps.    The sins of god include: murder (of the whole world except the ark), impregnating a virgin, rewarding lot after he tried to give away his virgin daughters to the town, acceptance of polygamous marriages in the old testament, etc. etc. etc. If a human were on trial for the same things we would put them away forever. Yet we excuse God by saying he knows what's best for us and he can do whatever he wants because he is GOD. Our American laws are based on the ten commandments yet we follow the laws of GOD who cannot keep his own commandments. If God was truly a perfect being he would have known in his "all time seeing vision" that we would mess up, and he wouldn't have tested eve with the apple. If God never made mistakes why did he wipe out the entire planet with a flood after the first batch of people did work out? If God didn't make mistakes why bother with the ten commandments if he knew nobody could follow them and he would have to send Jesus to get crucified on a cross to make up for it? I thought God knew everything. Frankly I've seen better administrative work during the Clinton administration, and that's saying something.  When will the (educated) wealthy countries learn to spread hope through actual tangible help to third world nations instead of "helping" them with false promises of heaven while we steal their oil, diamonds, and hope?  We have battered those weaker than us with our "religion" for far too long Somebody stop the planet, this "saved" Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist turned Evangelical Atheist wants to get off.  Angela  (San Antonio, Texas)   
 but this one just seem half done. The characters were interesting and I wanted a better description. Somehow they weren't fleshed out. It was just not like Lee Smith's previous books.  But there were beautiful scenes, wonderful dialogue in places and I almost gasped at some things that seemed so familiar from my youth in the south.  It was however a disappointment 
 This book is a great idea, but is very skimpy with the details.  The interviews consist of two questions (the same for each person) that cover general advice, but nothing specific about what the careers involve.  Some fields don't need this detail (high school education is something most of us are familiar with), but if I want to learn what a policy advisor actually does every day, I'll need to look beyond the "policy" career section of this book.  It was full of advice for success (improve your communication skills, do what you love), but rather short on what tasks you'd actually need to succeed at to make it in a particular career 
 This read like a college text book and was very disappointing.  Just because it was about disco didn't make it entertaining or a very good read 
 I initially purchased this book because I was looking for a kind of guide to using Chinese Exercise Balls 101.  Aside from the occasional typo found in the book Ab Williams writes a rather amateurish introduction to Chinese medicine beginning with Taoism, Yin & Yang, the various meridians found along the physiological plain and concludes with a short blurb about use of and benefits of the exercise balls.  The last third of the book is devoted to pushing various authors titles in all things eastern medicine oriented.  You could probably find a more detailed book for less money at a used book shop but for my purposes I gave this particular title two stars 
 First things last: Who's giving this record four and five stars?  I'm a big Ratt fan, all the way back to the E.P. But this just isn't a good album.  They'd resorted to outside writers by this point, because their main songwriter (Robbin Crosby) from their salad daze couldn't write killer songs anymore.  I always liked "One Step Away", but even that's a little too clean & polished for Ratt n'Roll.  Easily their worst full studio record of the five...  - cRAI 
 I could have spent the time it took me to read this book staring at the landscape from my window, sleeping, or stretching my neck.  Instead, I chose to read this book--a flagrant regrettable morose error for which I will be paying debt in this, as well as in future life times 
 Don't bother with this book.  Every place Richard went he ran into more characters and the whole point of the story had to be explained in painful detail to the new characters.  I have read the whole series and this was one of the worst.  Even a big important battle scene is barely talked about so they could focus on repeating Richards feelings to someone new... blegh 
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 This was a nice, fast read and kept me awake during my commute but in NO way should be compared to Amy Tan.  I found the cliches and overly descriptive scenarios very dull and annoying.  Seemed to me that the author was trying too hard (as if overboard description makes for good writing).    The character of Lindsey was shallow and ran away from anything remotely unsafe.  She annoyed me also.  I found the characters of Pau Pau and Michael were most endearing, though.    I bought both "The Dim Sum of All Things" and "Buddha Baby" at the same time.  "Buddha Baby" was very similar to "Dim Sum" and annoyed me for the exact same reasons.  
 I bought this book based on the rave reviews. Totally disappointed. This is a book of fortune-cookie adages with unnecessary mystery. I'm not giving it 0 star because I keep thinking if I get drunk, or I read it while I'm at sleep I might get at the messages 
 After completing the first 3 or 4 projects in this book, I had to run to the library and get the QuarkXpress Bible. Seriously, this book doesn't teach you much about anything. Nat Gertler barely goes over a lot of information and the projects you do are ugly and uninspired. This book may be good as a companion book while learning QuarkXpress, but I would thoroughly recommend the Quark Bible, for a comprehensive, nuts and bolts approach 
 Would be 5 stars but for his rhyming about the Jews controlling the media on the track propaganda 
 bought this disc on the recommendations of fellow listeners on Amazon....came away unimpressed; in fact, puzzled as to why anyone would think this a great record.  save for a couple of songs, you can't hear the crowd, Jerry Jeff's "voice" is average at best, and the general songwriting/lineup for this album is mundane.  I'm sure this guy has talent and would welcome any tips on other records from this artist but this one??? no thank you 
 This book has excellent information on less common vegetables.  However, if you are interested in similar information on vegetables that are used on a daily basis, this is not the book for you.  Some of the common vegetables missing from this book are tomatoes, corn, spinach, bell peppers, broccoli, celery, and garlic 
 I was quite sickened after finishing this book.  For some reason Mr. Feist has decided to debunk, destroy and remove almost all sense of mystique and continuity from certain major characters, his overall world/universe plot and the magic contained within the original 4 books.  I feel he has dishonored his characters, the story and the readers.  I so wish Jenny Wurts had co-wrote this for maybe we would have been spared this clumsy, lazy, unfathomable revision.  Almost all of the major 'reasons' we were led to believe at the end of the Riftwar saga were actually lies - oops sorry!    Poor Macros the Black - you were just an ordinary fraud with borrowed power and lies oozing out of every oriface.    Poor Dragon Lords - simply a tool of some mad genocidal god.  Poor Pug - you are destined to become the acceptable, palid, PC version of Macros forever being written to come up with reasons to justify not using your power.  Poor Thomas - hobbled in terms of power and without any real focus, purpose or point.  I think that Feist for personal and philosophical reasons felt he had to mess with his earlier mainly flawless creation and has ended up crafting something that is in all ways medicore by comparison.   What a pity.  I will stop here now and buy no more of his books and try very hard to forget I ever read this 
 While it is commendable that the author avoids the verbal fakery, jargon and obfuscation so common amongst academic authors, it is hard to imagine a flatter, duller narrative.  The evidence on offer here is anecdotal and therefore of limited value, and since the anecdotes are so mundane, there seems little reason to read the book.  Most adults can furnish their own supply of similar stories, have already come to some of the same conclusions, and won't find the insights very insightful.  Sociology remains thin stuff 
 a drunk finnish skipper gives him ze helm of his boat in 15 foot seas, then goes below for a nap. this after showing him how to read the instrument panel and telling him his compas has just been installed and is 10 degrees off. uh huh. then the panel goes dark, who knows why; maybe the 15 foot seas? should he wake the captain, nah, why do that when he can steer by the compass?  this is just the beginning of the book. this guy is so self absorbed that he writes his own review filled with what? more reviews! skip this work of fiction 
 Is this for real? It sounds like John Tesh or Harry Connick Jr. I just got this CD and it put me to sleep. It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again 
 I couldn't believe this came from the author of "About Face."  I've read many books on the current state of our military, but this was by far the worst.  He tells of his boring personal adeventures in all but the  very last chapter.  And in the last chapter he makes some of the craziest  and dumbest suggestions for military reform yet suggested.  Don't waste  your time on this one.  It was bad 
 I have nice sharp blades... I sliced veggies, and got all these tiny little plastic "hairs" that the cutting mat gave off as I sliced it up along with my veggies.  Had to toss them.  These mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough, or any other purpose other than for what they are made for... chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects. For the price it was worth testing them out.  
 This book will be a lovely addition to my compost heap.  I couldn't find any sense in the character's motivations so the whole mess became a simple, predictable voyage through a hamlet that any five-year-old could have dreamt up.  When coming across this one on the shelf, my advice is to keep on browsing 
 I only paid 60 cents in a used bookstore for this piece of tripe, but figured I used to live in Texas and like political stories, so .....  Then, I found the book so bad, so ridiculous I had to  keep going to make sure it would be on my list of real stinkers.  It is.  Just because you write for films, doesn't make you an author.  The writing was not bad, but I would suggest Mr. Richardson pay someone to give him a decent plot.  Additionally, the stereotype description of Texas and its citizens is quite insulting - very Hollywood.  So it's been sold and will be made into yet another bad movie.  It is really a shame and I did not find it "fun" or "enjoyable" because it was not good satire, it was just plain awful.  You can be sure if this guy keeps writing (I see it did write another which sounds even worse), I won't be reading and anyone who has good taste should avoid his books as well 
 I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one.  I can't believe it got such good reviews.  The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written.  However, the ending was awful and frustrating.  It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well.  It was also too much of a let down.  There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one 
 First off, a big thumbs down to the packing of this product! Mine arrived in the mail...BROKEN, and the box was full of holes due to a lose product inside the box because of poor packaging! I wonder if I lost something in shipping? Not sure because the box was half empty with only the product and a tiny instruction booklet. It made me realize just how cheap this product is made.  BOOOO to Amazon for selling such a cheap product for soo much money!   This makes me question if Amazon.com is such a great place to do my shopping 
 I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me.  It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible.  If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge.  I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire.  
 This book was heartbreaking for me to read.  I understood the dilemna Jon was going through with an aggressive dog, but I kept wondering why he could not have chosen to keep Orson in an enclosure, and take him for walks and/or the ORV rides Orson enjoyed in the mornings when no one was around.  He does seem to have taken the easy way out.  It comes down to this for me - Even though Jon thought that keeping Orson in an enclosure would be like a prison, don't you think Orson would have preferred that over death?  Aggressive dogs are tough.  I have one.  He has never bitten anybody, but he hardly has a chance.  I keep him behind a fence, and when we go on walks he is always on a leash, with two lines attached to his collar.  Even though he is a problem dog, we have a very happy, active, life together.  We both are happiest when we are out in nature together 
 A French saying goes: "The more things change, the more they stay the same."  It appears that the "historical" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.    Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to "purify" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is "preserve the Aryan race."  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.  Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single "good" thing about this movie would have been "discovered/invented" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.    They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a "hero" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.    In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the "techniques" that this film claims to have "discovered" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess 
 This book outlines very basic exercises for women, and a very dangeous nutritional plan. There is no part of this book specifically tailored for women, except the photos of some women who look like unhealthy steroid users (with 5 o'clock shadows).  I would have liked to see pregnancy, breastfeeding and menstruation addressed, in the exercises as well as in the nutrition plan.  (Can a breastfeeding woman live on 1200 calories per day?)  The authors' indroductions and histories of eating disorders suggest emotional instability with a hint of misogynism 
 I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today. 
 Disappointing:- very bad quality reproductions of Wllies drawings and photographs,they are blured and lose much of the detail. Many amateur drawings clearly not by Willie.Only good pics. are on the cover 
 While I have an excellent understanding of the metaphysical philosopy, the idea that one can diagnose and cure disease such as HIV and Aids with diet, castor oil packs and the like, is absurd. As a registered nurse, my first and only encounter with this author, leaves me unsure, other than book sales, why she would make this claim.   The early introduction of this holistic, and terribly simplistic approach to HIV treatment, instantly blows her credibility as any kind of holistic intuitive/healer. The book rambles and shows an overwhelming self-absorption of the author with her real or imagined skills.   
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 If you like nude guys wrestling each other for 1 whole hour then this is your movie there is no after  scene like in a hot steamy shower. Just nude guys wrestling I thought it was boring 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 The writing needs some work.  This album probably won't see significant rotation in my playlist 
 White Tantra seeks to conquer the demons we have inside, as opposed to enslaving ourselves to them. White Tantra ALWAYS teaches to RENOUNCE animal desire. This is how one becomes a purified soul, a Mahatma, an angel, an illuminated Master: these types of people have no lust, no desire, and are not controlled by animal instinct. How could an angel have lust? How could an angel have pride? To become an Illuminated Soul, we must remove all that is impure from the soul. Books and schools that teach how to awaken through lust, through the orgasm, through desire, are teaching BLACK TANTRA: they are teaching humanity how to awaken as Black Magicians. The purified soul has removed all animal instinct and pride, lust, fear, jealousy, attachment, etc.  By stumilating and feeding lust we only deepen our slavery to sensation and animal desire, thus increasing our karma and our suffering.  White Sexual Magic is the pure sexual activity of the Djinns, of the Angels, the Buddhas - for God creates through sex.  BE CLEAR: we create through our use of sex, but we can create either an Angel or a Demon.  For more information, read "The Perfect Matrimony," "The Revolution of Beelzebub," and "The Mysteries of the Fire" by Samael Aun Weor 
 This was my introduction to Terry Pratchett's writing.  Reading all of the reviews led me to believe that this book was a funny take on the world of cats.  This book, which reads like an essay of observations, is not ground breaking and is certainly not hilarious.  If I were counting I would say that there might have been ten chuckles all together.  Certainly not as funny as it was cracked up to be. The treatment felt superficial and the observations felt recycled from other writings about cats.  Nothing here would recommend this book over any other cat book or story that I have read 
 This is like teen-love-fiction, and by that I mean it's like a teenager wrote it, one who uses bad detail, cliche phrases, overused idioms, bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot.  Meet mr. millionaire who teaches polo to a woman -- and they of course fall in love, slowly, boringly, painfully.   Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development. Yuck.  She says on the back she's responding to a call for something like energy and thrills and sexy writing.  Uh, not in this one.  The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that's not very good either.    The best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM 
 I was searching for a large type book of the current Prayer Book which the ad indicated that this was. What I received as a standard edition of the 1928 version 
 since there is little to no mystery involved in the story.  I should have expected this, since this has been the trend for the last 4 or 5 books in the series.  I had put off reading this one for precisely that reason but needed something to read for the weekend so I decided to give it a try.  The best thing that can be said about this "Turkey" is that it's a quick read, so it's good for a plane ride, but if you want something that remotely resembles a mystery pass this one up and read one of the first books by this author which really were engaging and satisfying mysteries.    Even as a glimpse into the small town life of Moose County this one falls flat.  It used to be that one of the charms of the series was the way Braun had developed the world of Moose County and all the foibles of its inhabitants and if tragedy struck one you really felt for them.  In this book, characters from previous books are randomly introduced and they wander around aimlessly and there is no emotional depth to Qwill's relationship with any of them.     The other problem that has happened to the series is that Braun fell in love with her own character.  Qwill started the series as a flawed charcter.  In "Turkey" there is even more rapturous description of Qwill's mustache and wonderful voice than usual, not to mention the ovations for the ridiculous Big Storm production.  We are supposed to believe that it is so well received that there are to be several performances a week throughout the summer - how big is the population of Moose county?    SPOILER ALERT:  But to cap off the ridiculousness of this book, Qwill leaves his beloved Koko out in the gazebo with a confessed murderer who is strung out on drugs.  The Qwill of past books would never have intentionally put either cat in danger like this.    According to her fan club web page, she was born in 1916 so now she's pushing 90.  It's possible she's in poor health. Because of this I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and agree with those who suggest this book was ghost-written based on notes she made.  That would account for inconsistencies in plot and style.  The only good part of this book - the only reason it deserves even one star - is the description of YumYum playing with her thimble (but even it is taken from another of Braun's books).  It's on page 72 - read it, then find something else to read.          
 This is a horrible example of sophmoric "witty" commentary paired with the idiocy of stat-based evaluation. If irrelevant asides were not enough, they are mostly wrong as regards players from the team I follow closely, the Oakland A's. Take the notes on Houston Street ("never will be in the Lidge/Rivera class"), Zito ("overrated"), minor leaguer Travis Buck (stupid comments on his name, totally inappropriate), Ander Ethier (overmatached in the big leagues). Where their prognastications are reasonable, a simple extrapolation from previous years (anyone could do it in their head) would suffice, not some pseudo sophisticated computer program. I hate this book 
 I had to read this book as a freshman in college in 1985 (it's since been updated). The professor offered an A to anyone who read it five times--so I did! As a result, I was stunted intellectually for several years, before I finally learned about some basic economic fallacies.   Parenti's book, which is little more than propaganda, is one long string of economic fallacies. For example, one of his favorite arguments is that just a few people, corporations, etc, in the US own most of the assets and property. He never stops to ask the question: So what? What follows? This is only self-evident proof of injustice if economic exchange is a zero-sum game, so that if one person gains five dollars, then someone, somewhere, lost five dollars.   But everything we know about economics refutes the assumption. Wealth is created. The fact that the outcomes of wealth are unevenly distributed proves nothing, especially since many of the individuals and companies with the most wealth are the very same individuals and companies that create the most wealth.  By missing such simple distinctions, this book should only be persuasive to colleged freshmen who are blissfully ignorant of economic fallacies. And someone of those freshmen will do what I did: they will keep reading, and figure out how out of touch Parenti is. I doubt Parenti imagined his agitprop would backfire, and produce conservatives who don't like to be propagandized 
 I bought this book online & did not get a chance to look through it first. So, if you are interested in pictures of Debra because she is so beautiful - be warned - there are none! The only picture of her is on the cover. The ex husband that wrote this book did not even include a private wedding photo, childhood pictures of her, or any personal pictures of her or them as a couple. I find the lack of pictures a little strange, since he is so forthcoming with so much personal information about her, surely he could include some photos. Anyway, Owen Lafave talks alot about Debra's abusive past relationships with other guys & her upbringing with an emotionally distant father. Owen knows going into the relationship with Debra that she has had alot of personal problems which also include an on going eating disorder & she has had numerous fits of rage & jealousy. He decribes her as very insecure. Because she is so beautiful & smart he overlooks her problems & proceeds to marrying her. There were plenty of red flags that things were not right with Debra from the start! He even describes problems in their sex life! I do get the impression that Owen is bitter & trying to get his revenge on Debra through this book. Though, I feel it's understandable that he would feel humiliated & betrayed, there is information in this book that he has disclosed about Debra that is very personal and really none of anyone's business.  If anyone wants to see a good interview of Debra & her side of the story catch Matt Lauer's recent interview with her. She speaks openly & honestly & you get a better sense of her and what happened. She even mentions that she should of been put in jail for what she did. She has been forbidden to write  a book of her own or from profiting in any way from what happened.  This book is an OK read. I would say get a copy & read it for yourself, just don't expect any pictures 
 You really wont learn much about leadership from this expensive tome.  Its just a compilation of short sketches about people who are known for leadership.  Nothing in depth at all.  I regret having spent the money on this book.  I should have looked it over more closely before buying it 
 I must admit that there may be some really helpful items hidden in this book, but it is just so fluffy and disorganized that it is impossible to read.  I have a more linear and logical approach to this sort of thing, so maybe it will appeal to other readers.  But for me, there was little helpful information and a woefully small amount of pith buried in an avalanche of words.  It seems like it is trying to form a new scheme every 10 pages.  Really not a publication-level job of writing.  
 I bought and read the first 3 Titan books all in a row, just about as quickly as I could.  In my other reviews of the first 2 books, I stated that I enjoyed the stories, but could have done without the whole gay theme.  The stories were quite good, in my opinion, though.  This 3rd book, written by a new author from the first 2 books, wasn't a very good addition to the series.  The author did a good job in writing, for the most part, but he tended to over-describe several situations in which it seemed like he was just adding fluff and words to make the book longer.  Most of these rants didn't add anything to the story.  And I have to agree with one previous reviewer who said that the "star jellies" story wasn't all that interesting.  This book was the "Star Trek 5" addition to the Titan series and I hope to see the next few books much stronger additions than this one.  The most annoying thing about this story was that Riker was made out to be a weakling.  His indecisive actions contradicted the Prime Directive, caused more trouble for his crew, and pretty much left Deanna in charge of  being the leader in the story.  This is NOT the Riker that we all grew to know in the TNG series.  I certainly hope that the next book includes a more powerful Captain to lead the new voyages of Titan 
 What a boring book this is. i have always felt like falling asleep. The whole book just keep talking about the same point that i have already known. But the way the story is told just like it's a surpring fact. i don't understand why this book is worth reading and interesting. i think it's so boring. What is interesting is he spent such a long time wrting a boring book 
 Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's.  This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since.  
 I will be upfront about this - the Song of Solomon is penetrated by a profound feminine interiority.  Surprisingly, this work by a recognized feminist biblical scholar resists this understanding. In her earliest writing, Professor Exum treated the author as male at face value.  Quickly learning that this position was untenable, she then took the view that the poem could have been written by a male or female but she would not stake a claim to the sex of the author. Now, in this book, she retreats to the position that feminine authorship is a distant possibility.  Curiously, at a time when even conservative Christian theologians concede that (more likely than not) the poet was a women, the position of J. Cheryl Exum makes little sense in light of her other feminist thinking.  Due to her other books, I expected a daring and imaginative analysis. Instead the work is so...mainstream. Its fundamental flaw is that the author never develops a theory that unifies the language of the poem. Marvin Pope and Michael Fox see it as entertainment at love feasts; Andre LeCocque understands it as a protest poem subversive of the prophets; Ellen Davis sees it as a celebration of the sacred.  Renita Weems argues that the Song is a poetic model for individual empowerment. Perhaps it is some if not all of these things.  But Professor Exum grasps the Song of Solomon as nothing more than a canonical work of lyric poetry.  Even if that were the case, one would expect a translation sensitive to the musical idiom. Instead, her translation is quite pedestrian.  Due to the author's studied effort to provide uncontroversial opinion, this work is appropriate to high school as opposed to critical university study.  
 I found this book to be patronizing and condescending.  Maybe it's great for professional trainers who are also patronizing and condescending?  It seems likely that this book's success is largely dependent upon the publisher having a good marketing strategy. 
 The book describes well the complexities of relationships- between the son, Will, and his father, Sonny; between Sonny and his wife Aila; between Sonny and his lover Hannah, between everyone and the political situation at hand. However, the frequency of pronouns can be confusing and the long,  impassioned dialogues never directly state anything at all. One must  already be familiar with the apartheid and liberation movement to fully  comprehend the book 
 While this dictionary does contain a lot of entries, it is English to Arabic only; there is no Arabic to English.  It does however show the short vowels, though the script is a little frustratingly small.  I took it back once I found out it was only a one-way dictionary.  The Arabic Practical Dictionary by Hippocrene is much better (though it doesnt' show short vowels however) 
 I just want to reiterate the other review by saying that this is the WORST. CASEBOOK. EVER.  No headings. No organization. The notes are terrible. The book is too long to ever get through.  Simply the worst casebook ever written 
 I expected so much more from Terry.  This book was too boring for words!  Don't waste your money.  She is too talented to put something like this out there.  
 Vickers just can't write!  He's fantastic in an archive and here has gathered an excellent array of facts from numerous sources.  He has also done an excellent job of putting everything together.  But he just isn't at all a good writer.  His style is awkward and clumpsy - he doesn't know how to effectivel tell a story.  How he got as far as he did is a modern wonder.  AND the cause of the book, being in effect comissioned by Prince Philip, was also it's death, as it is extremely prejudiced in presenting only what the palace wants us to know and believe.  There are numerous unpleasant and controversial facts about the historical characters in the book which are neatly omitted, and Alice is always sympathetically and gallantly focused.  No even-handed critique or analysis here - just a nice Windsor-approved glowing tribute, and poorly written 
 Rio Bravo is a classic. This review isn't about that as everyone knows what they're getting in terms of the film. The movie industry is another matter. I saw a recent debate between a couple arguing about the state of things in the industry and how movie and entertainment comapanies are crying poor. The reason is simple, when you try to rip people off on a consistant basis, you get everything you deserve. There's many areas I could go into detail, but I'll just add my comment regarding the dvd's. How many versions of the same movie can you possibly release? Let's see, there's the original one, the HD version, then (like this one) there's the "special" two-disc set with all the extras they didn't include on the original. But wait, there's more. Next of course will be the new and improved "blue-ray" edition! This one is even better folks! Give me a break. It's time people stopped falling for this crap! Everytime you purchase another version, you're telling these crooks that's it's ok to pull this stuff, and you're also showing just how gullible you really are. This is a form of the oldest selling scam there is. Hold 'em ransom for better versions. No wonder the pirate market is flourishing. 
 Mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around. They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who "invented" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has. The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.   
 This book is almost an exact replica of the previous book by Chris Nickson "Mariah Carey- her story".  There was very little new information.  Plus, most of his research is just magazine articles that  most die-hard fans (like me) already own.  There weren't any exclusive  pictures, no actual quotes from Mariah about the book, nothing that made it  any more spectacular than a scrapbook made by a fan (which would have  probably been more interesting).  This book is better for someone who is  not a huge fan, but would like to learn some things about her and her life.   I think many fans who have been loyal from day one could have gotten  together to write a better book 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 In its time, Rand's vision was intoxicating.  We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned.  The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy.  But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives.  I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy.  Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure.  
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 A quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers from having too much star power. No matter how scruffy and wain the filmmakers try to make Nicole Kidman look, she's still Nicole Kidman. Her portrayal of a janitor really pushes the limits of "suspension of disbelief" with her delicate features and legs that go on forever.   And Anthony Hopkins is also miscast as a Jewish professor with a hard knock, secret past. While he remains one of my favorite actors, he cannot escape his "Britishness" which is even more unbelievable once you discover what his character's past is! The real discovery of this film is Wentworth Miller's absolutely astonishing turn as the teenage Anthony Hopkins.   Ultimately, the film is worth seeing for Wentworth Miller alone. But the casting of two megawatt Hollywood actors hurts the believability of this film in the end 
 I really had little idea the cinematic pain train I was boarding as I watched Rats - Night of Terror (1983) aka Rats - Notte di terrore last night.  Oh sure, I read the reviews and what not, but to really get a true understanding of the film's utterly rotten essence,  you must watch it, and experience it, for yourself.  I've seen a hell of a lot of bad movies in my time, but I have to say, this fetid, moldering bit if Italian produced flotsam buried the needle on my Suck-O-Meter, something that hasn't happened since I watched Red Serpent (2002), with Michael Paré and Roy Scheider.  Written and directed by Bruno Mattei, the man who gave us such wonders as S.S. Extermination Love Camp (1977) and the ode to the usage of stock footage Hell of the Living Dead (1980), the film features Ottaviano Dell'Acqua (Zombi 3), Geretta Geretta (Demons), Massimo Vanni (Escape from the Bronx), Ann-Gisel Glass (Deadly Eyes), Henry Luciani, and Fausto Lombardi (Don't Look in the Attic).  The film started off well enough, with some displayed text telling us about how a great, nuclear holocaust drove those humans left alive under the ground, where they developed sophisticated societies.  After some years, some (fool) hearty individuals decided on returning to the surface, to enjoy the toxic wonderment I suppose, and became viewed as primitives by those who remained down below.  The story picks up in the year 225 A.B. (After the Bomb) as we see a motorcycle gang tooling around the wasteland (looks like an old rock quarry to me).  As I was wondering just where in the heck they got the gas to run their machines, they boogie on into a dilapidated city, deciding this might be a good place to set up camp...and this is about the time the, as the boys from MST3k would say, the `deep hurting' began as the characters started to actually talk.  Anyway, the find a deserted research facility, complete with canned food, plants (fresh vegetables and fruit), and fresh water, littered with gnawed on corpses...well, it's not completely deserted, as there's the rats, and plenty of them.  They clear out the dead bodies, move into their new digs, and soon enough the mutated, furry, super rodents begin picking off the gang one by one.  Not only that, but the verminous mongrels have eaten up the tires on the vehicles, preventing those who haven't become all ate up from leaving.  As tensions rise, more annoying characters die (thankfully), and leadership of the gang comes into question, but there's little time for debate as the hairy horde begin their relentless onslaught (apparently grungy bikers are good eatin'...who knew?) challenging man's long standing position on the top of the food chain...  Seems pretty straightforward, right?  Well, perhaps, but essentially what I did was put a nice sheen on a stanky (stank goes well beyond stink) turd, and believe me, that was not an easy task...really, the absolute worst aspect of this film is the writing.  Here's an example, once the rats begin killing off the characters, one woman spits out this little gem of brilliance, "The idea of being killed right now really frightens me."  And here's another, as the leader of the gang prepares to flash fry a whole mess of rats with his flamethrower, "I'm going to warm their whiskers."  Oh criminey...the film is filled with completely unnatural dialog, pointless interactions, accompanied by atrocious, awe inspiringly overblown performances.  I swear, the actors chewed up more scenery than the rats themselves.  As far as the characters go, a more irritating bunch you'll rarely see.  One can't help but root for the voracious rodentia.  And get the names of some of these a-holes...Duke, Video, Lucifer, Chocolate...there was one character that was particularly loathsome in that of Myrna, a leather clad woman who spent a great deal of time losing her marbles and screeching incoherently throughout the film.  Here's another juicy line of idiocy, as one mook finds a bottle of booze and begins sucking it down..."Hey, what an incredible drink!"...yeah, drink up boyo, as your time is gonna come.  I think the absolute worst scene for me was near the beginning, when the group found all the food and began celebrating by dumping sugar and flour all over each other, dancing about like mental deficients.  The black woman, named Chocolate (nice), ends up covered in flour, and starts shouting how she's white, while doing a very loose interpretation of an Irish jig.  The effects throughout weren't too bad, but mostly featured people off screen either throwing, or dumping rats onto the performers.  There were a few gruesome bits, like the rat in the sleeping bag gag, and the exploding corpse piñata filled with rodents, so fans of the visceral will find something to enjoy.  Now I've read where some think the awful aspects of the film are intentional in a comedic sense, and even the back of the DVD case makes statements along these lines, but I honestly believe the original intent was to try and make a serious, scary film, and once the finished product was out there, everyone assumed it to be a joke, so Mattei went along with this rather than cop to the fact he's a lousy writer....hell, that's what I would have done, if I were in his Italian loafers...I suppose it doesn't make a difference one way or another, as if you're an aficionado of rotten, sleazy, awful cinema, this one's right up your alley.  As far as the directing, apparently Mattei, who started working on this film right after completing a project with Jess Franco, keeps things moving along, disjointedly, but seems to have thankfully taken few cues from that Spanish hack (seriously, ever seen Oasis of the Zombies?  If so, you know what I'm talking about).  Hey, at least there's a decent nekkid chick in the movie, which is nearly spoiled by a nekkid man and the appearance of his wang dang doodle.  As far as the ending, I did see it coming, and despite the fact it was completely ridiculous, it was suitable for this story.  Anchor Bay Entertainment provides on this DVD a very good-looking, widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic print, along with mediocre Dolby Digital 2.0 audio (some of it was really soft, in terms of the dialog, but perhaps that was for the best given the script).  Special features include a lengthy theatrical trailer, a Bruno Mattei bio, an interview with Mattei titled `Hell Rats of the Living Dead' (9 minutes), and a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art included on an insert, the flipside listing the chapter stops.  Cookieman108  By the way, I think plenty of rats were harmed in the making of this film...also, if you're interested in buying this DVD, I'd suggest doing what I did and buying the Anchor Bay DVD Fright Pack: Man's Worst Friends, which features six films including Parasite (1982), Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat (1989), Slugs: The Movie (1988), Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror (1984), Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), and Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971). It's available here on the Amazon website, at a really good price, and cheaper than buying the individual releases. 
 This is the last Honor Harrington book I'll read. The first 300 pages have NO STORY. Nothing happens until the last three chapters, and then it's predictable and uninteresting. This book was a complete waste of my time and money, except that it really did solve my insomnia a few times (and I'm serious--I fell asleep EVERY TIME I tried to read it).  Book One was good despite the long, ponderous history lessons and techno/military exposition. Honor and her fellow characters were interesting and the action was intense.  Book Two was amazing, a great read without the flaws of the first book. I was surprised to get so emotionally involved, and some of the climactic scenes are among the finest I've ever read in science fiction. From first page to last, it was an exciting, interesting, fun, emotional read, and well worth the money and time.  Then we get this drivel, the "Dull Ponderous War."  I wish I could get my money back, but more importantly I wish I could get my time back.  This book ended my interest in Honor Harrington and in David Weber. 
 If you're impressed with books by ageing wannabees desperately seeking reassurance through the challenging medium of bored, penniless prostitutes, you'll find this riveting. Otherwise you'll probably find it to be indulgent garbage.  I first went to Cuba in 1995 (being from Europe it was not a problem to travel there), around the time the Buena Vista Social Club was gaining worldwide recognition. It was a fascinating place. I stopped going about five years ago, as the place was becoming oppressive, full of miserable sex tourists and those same bored, penniless prostitutes who practically throw themselves at any foreigner who has a few dollars to offer (the average monthly wage in Cuba is about $10). It is also becoming more dangerous, due in part to the growing desperation and in part to the increase in drug activity. Inevitably, AIDS is becoming more widespread.  Baker seems at home amidst the seedier side of modern day Cuba. A quick look at the website makes it easier to understand why that might be. His gullibility, so apparent in the book, is perhaps less easy to comprehend. Don Juan, he clearly ain't. But he is supposed to be well traveled.  If what you are really interested in is a well-researched book on Cuba, believe me, there are much better ones than this. Don't be conned 
 First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.  This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:            Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.    Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out 
 This book was poorly written. Its plot was somewhat implausible and the characters were anything but dynamic. It seemed more like a screenplay thinly disguised as a novel, as it possessed very little literary merit. I would not recommend this book to anyone who values his or her leisure time 
 The play was relatively entertaining and has a promising beginning, but Higgins' infuriating and incesant bullying doesn't change, and quickly becomes tiresome. You keep expecting the characters to evolve, to grow into something better, or at least different, and none of them really do. Doolittle is still lazy, Pickering always the gentlemen, and most frustratingly, Eliza and Henry are never truly able to understand one another. In the beginning I was an immediate fan, but as the story continued I grew more and more dissatisfied, and by the end I felt that it was a complete waste of time 
 I heard that Deborah Harry had a small cameo in this flick so I sat down and watched it on HBO.  It was so freakin' boring and the acting was just BLAH!  The singing was horrible too, and was that Julia Roberts in there!  The only good thing is the Deborah Harry cameo (I love Debbie Harry).   Everything else was just BLAH AND BORING! ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ 
 A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors. 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 Unfortunately, I believe that this book had great potential, but fell short of delivering.  The book contains a good deal of interesting info, but all of this info can be found on the Internet for free.  The information on the Internet is a good deal more detailed though.  This book should have been proofed by someone who owns an LS1 engine.. 
 This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else 
 Book started off cutely, with Biegler the former DA coming home from fishing to find a murder had occured in the county, and making all sorts of smart remarks.  The case: Woman says she is raped, husband kills rapist.  The book should actually be called "Anatomy of a Murder Trial", since it does go on at length about that.  I never could understand why an attorney from the State Attorney General's office shows up to assist (basically taking over the prosecution) the new DA.  And of course he's just as horrid as can be, and Paul Biegler, the defense attorney gets to make all the witty cracks, putting Dancer in his place, and win the case.  The book is quite different from the movie (which wasn't very good either), in that except for the Attorney General taking over the case, and surprise witnesses showing up with no notice to either side, the book makes more sense, and of course, has more detail to explain things.  But instead of getting to the heart of the matter, the author seemed to want to show off his ability to blather on and on about nothing 
 This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though. 
 This book is an interesting read.  The Author Marc Elliot is good at prose...and unlike some readers, I do not mind the occasional un-dotted I...etc.  My problem with this book is different.  The author is clearly trying to break down the 'good guy' image of Stewart.  He comes up with all sorts of (in my opinion) phony sexual stories about Stewart including that he visited a MGM sponsored brothel in order to prove his 'heterosexuality.'  Come on...this is garbage.  Also, he doesent miss a chance at the old Marlene Deitrich abortion story which I believe to be 'hooey' to use a Jimmy word.  The author states that JS is a feminine hero and that many of his films have sexual undertones.  I just don't believe this...and the fact that the author has written for Penthouse really sets the stage for what you are in for.  This is a very biased book.  And I wouldnt recomend it.   Also, before you spend money on this book...research the author.  I didn't do this until I had purchased the book and I learned that his previous material doesent seem to fit.  He is most known for a book entitled  "Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince" The Jimmy Stewart book (in my opinion-again) does an extreme disservice to JS.  The author misses some of his movies entirely and also misses "The Six Shooter" radio series that Jimmy did for NBC in the 50's.  The book is interesting to read (Marc is a great story teller)...but the dirt doesent stick (never has) and I would'nt believe a word of it if I were you.  Finally, I don't like the 'Jimmy was thinking/feeling' additions...there is simply no way to know what the man was thinking.  Take my advice and let Jimmy's films speak for themselves.       
 This isn't even close to authentic or realistic. My 3-year-old said he'd rather use the cheap plastic hats the fire departments pass out than this. The hat's PVC plastic means soft formed and when the description says "Finished with soft red plush trim"--it's on the outside. As soon as we opened this, we knew it was going back.  
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 "Authorized" is misleading ---This book is an "authorized" training material, which signifies that it covers the content of the relevant certification exams.  The accuracy and delivery of the content, however, have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by the certifying agencies.    A review of the Table of Contents (16 pages worth) leads one to believe this book (800+ pages worth) will cover it all and with great detail.  From there to Chapter 4 (where I decided the book wasn't worth completing), it was mostly downhill.  Here are some examples of what I found:  - terms not introduced or not introduced at the first use, and/or not identified in the glossary - layout and delivery of information difficult to follow, repetitious of some information, while not including other pertinent information - errors (bandwidth of Cat 5e cable listed at 200 Mbps (Table 1-5, pg 11) and at 100 Mbps (Table 4-2, pg 101)) - errors (pg 24: Chapter 1 test question # 4 directs to Table 1-2 rather than Table 1-3 to reference for answering)  - why?! (includes text, tables and figures with details on voltage/plugs/etc. used by other countries, yet is incomplete on the products used in the US)   - errors (pp 83-84: identifies the "minimum" bend radius for Cat5 to be 1 inch, while Figure 3-7 depicts the diameter) - errors (pg 85: last paragraph refers to Figures 3-11 and 3-12, rather than Figures 3-9 and 3-10) - errors (pg 93: Answer #1 is identified as "C, User Training Guide", but the answer text expands on "D, Wire Chart".   I highly recommend persons desiring the CompTIA HTI+ and/or CEDIA Installer I certifications, as well as those wishing to simply increase their knowledge base, look elsewhere for study materials.    Some of the information provided in this book may truly be of value (i.e. accurate and complete), however, with all the errors I've found, I am unable to rely on this book as a good resource.  
 this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable.  Good enough to watch once 
 When I first got into broadcasting over 30 years ago I quickly learned about radio groupies, the DJ's "biggest fans" who call the request lines to tease and flirt with the DJ in that seductive, yet deceptive voice.  Because a friend recommended that I must see this movie, I, fortunately, learned the easy way how not to fall into the trap many many DJs have gotten into and continue to get into.  I have in turn have suggested the same to new, up and comming DJs to watch, learn and heed.  Although this does a good job teaching rookie Djs a course in ethics, the film as a film kind of stinks that's why the two stars.  Poor lighting and sound makes this a true B movie 
 This book is such a downer.  Besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown-up sisters, and all of the complicated problems between Julie & Romeo's families, we have an eight-year old, Sarah, running the show in Julie's house.  Besides watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory endlessly, she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets!!  They have their very own Veruca Salt living in that house!!    If you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone, this is the book for you.  It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first one.   
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 Horribly organized with too many fillers. Too many meaningless phrases only makes sentences longer making meanings less understandable. The size of the book would've been half if useless phrases were not used too much 
 This book was an incredible waste of time. I felt that the essays were a) far too dated (a rambling discourse on the dangers of cookies) or b) too out of touch (Rape in cyberspace was NOT a real rape in cyberspace, folks) The authors seem to be mainly scholars without a tech background than technical folks and I have to agree that the thesaurus was in heavy use during the writing of most of the these essays. Finally the book contains very little practical information on cyberethics. Not even a single case study 
 This book is a prime example of the old adage: "Those who can't do, teach." The author of this book has never been the primary author of a major scientific paper (he is a professor of English), but he tries to give advice on how to write an effective scientific article. Because he has little to say on the subject, much of the text is made up of amusing anecdotes and quips rather than substantive guidelines. An example of the unhelpful advice he doles out is on page ninety-two, where he advises the reader to submit a typed, rather than handwritten, manuscript to the publisher. He litters his chapters with cute Peanuts cartoons depicting Snoopy getting rejection letters from publishers: a great way to take up space, but not useful to someone seeking practical advice on how to prepare a scientific article. He also gives advice on good grammar, which is more within his area of expertise. But there are better books on the subject of good writing, the classic example of which is Strunk and White's Elements of Style. I would advise the fledgling scientific writer to read many scientific articles in order to learn how to construct them effectively. On the other hand, if you want to learn how to write a whole book about something of which you know almost nothing, Dr. Day's "How to Write & Publish a Scientific Paper" would be a great place to start 
 The idea of eating less meat has always appealed to me. I found this book in hopes of learning how to find other sources of protein. I just wanted a book to tell me some easy to read guidelines, all I found in this book was a lot of big words. You have to have a PHD in nutrition to read it. The more I read the more confused I got. This book is NOT for the casual reader 
 I found this book a bit boring. In the beginning, the book is a little slow, and then the adventure picks up, and then slows down again at the end. I also thought that the book was on the harder side; there are lots of characters to remember and some of them have the very similar names, so sometimes it can become just a little confusing. I would not recommend this book to others because it wasn't interesting and it wasn't a page-turner. Historical-fiction lovers would probably find this to be okay though 
 When I bought this cd, no where at all on the case did it say that it was partly a live album. I was very upset after I quickly went to my favorite song, and found a mess of a live version in its place. I am not a fan of live albums, and would NEVER have bought this if I had known. They are not even good attempts at the songs that I grew up loving. All he managed to do is yell a lot, sing off key, and play to the crowd. My favorite Neil Diamond songs were destroyed, but on a HAPPY note, at least the WHOLE album wasn't live. 
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 I have been interested in improving my performance for years, and finally decided to take the plunge and look into heart-rate monitoring. This book does not really support a specific philosophy and who knows if the so called "science" is supportable. I also read "Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot" by John L. Parker and recommend it. It appears much more scientific and emphasizes recovery over training in a zone. Don't buy this book.  Rory Donaldson roryd@brainsarefun.co 
 This has been called a Viking version of Beauty and the Beast. They had the sets, props, costumes, and boats..... but they could have used some actors and a script. They were about as Viking as the Egyptians were Egyptian in the 1940s era movies. They stole their actors from B rated '80s glam rock. This movie is to Beauty and the Beast what a soap opera version of Men in Tights would be to History. It may be good for a laugh, especially when trying to do it justice in a review 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 I'm a huge Bone fan, but this prequel was a letdown.  Sniegoski isn't nearly as good a writer as Jeff Smith.  The story is repetitive, the humor falls flat, and the dialogue is terrible.  The talking monkey is particularly annoying, and has about five times as many lines as necessary.  The story doesn't compliment the original series in the way that the excellent Rose series does.  Also, the final third of the book is Riblet, a story about a baby boar who beats up rat cratures.  Riblet is just...bad.  It's drawn by Stan Sakai of Usagi Yojimbo fame, who really can't hold a candle to Jeff Smith for draftsmanship.  Smith's typically excellent artwork in the first part of the book is the best thing about this volume, which is otherwise superfluous 
 The only recommendation on the back of the book says it all! It's from Dr.John R. Lee -- well no wonder! 1/3 of HIS book is in this one. She merely regurgitates other authors such as John R. Lee, Susan Love, and  several others. NONE of it is based in fact that IS her own material, and  makes absolutely NO common, medical, or wholistic sense whatsoever! Take  for example Ms.Sellman's section on Endometriosis an often painful,  sometimes debilitating disease: "Christine Northrup, M.D., author of  Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, considers endometriosis an illness of  competition. She believes that it comes about when a woman's emotional  needs are competing with her functioning in the outside world." Good  Grief! Why not just say that it's "All in her head" instead of  the pain in her gut. This book is a throw-back to "good sex, and a  good time honey, will cure what ails ya"! I would give this book  NEGATIVE stars if I could. This book not only is not original, but it's a  collection of anti-female drivel thinly vieled in a masochistic hatred for  women who think for themselves while PRETENDING TO try to encourage women  to "be wiser and listen to what their bodies are trying to tell  them". But, yet, a disease as horrific and painful as endometriosis  apparently will be cured if we take care of some psychological needs. Then  there's the chapter on "Hormone Addiction". I wonder how many men  would allow you to suggest that they're "dependance" on  testosterone is somehow a gender WEAKNESS 
 I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it???  Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good. 
 I bought this book because I was looking for a good sports-medicine guide to stretching....I was very disappointed after reading only a few pages.  The author apparently believes stretching is the cure for all of life's aliments - physically, spiritually, and psychologically.  On page 8 the author claims that "I used those stretches to heal my appendix."  That statement should be enough reason, for any person with a sliver of intellect or respect for science and medicine, to stay far away for this book.  This book may sell well in San Francisco or Vermont, but for all others, I do not recommend it.  As a public service announcement:  If any one is having problems with their appendix, please go straight to the emergency room.  Do not waste any time touching your toes, standing on your head, or gazing into crystals.  If your appendix burst you will be in a lot of pain, and could possible die 
 Scruton comes off as something of a learned amateur; I have no idea if music is his "field," but if it is, he hasn't been exposed to an idea that emerged since the '50s.  Virtually all of the ideas in this longish book have been stated before, by people with greater knowledge and experience than he and with more excuses for being wrong.  I mean, Adorno could be forgiven his false conclusions (somewhat) because of when he lived and the environment in which he was raised.  Scruton, living today, has none of these excuses for his dated arguments and almost primitive knowledge of music outside of Western Classical.  The best aspects of this book are the first few chapters, which are basically a regurgitation of the usual music philosophy from a Western Art Music bent.  You can get this information elsewhere, but Scruton does do a decent job of summarizing it in a readable, well-organized fashion.  The book falls apart after that, though, and for a good laugh check out the chapter in which Scruton (weakly) takes swipes at jazz and rock, revealing his virtual ignorance of the nuances of either style 
 Compact design but cheap materials. A vital piece of plastic came off when I set it down on the bedstand. Another exhibit in the "you get what you pay for" sweepstakes. I threw it away 
 This bookd paints hezbollah in a very benign manner.  The author goes to great detail to explain how hezbollah helps the lebanese people.  I did not know much about hezbollah before i read this book.  I was interested in learning why they were among the world's most feared terrorist groups.  This book did not do that for me.  From the little I do know about this book it turns the tiger into a mouse.  If you're interested in reading about how hezbollah really isnt that bad and Israel is the devil, Buy this book.  If you're not keep searching for a good book on hezbollah, I've yet to find one 
 By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.   Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe. "The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.     
 Bill Bryson's zest for life is made manifest in the books he's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest.  This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.  This one, sadly, is disappointing.  It is a rote run-through of American history, of the "cherished myths debunked" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows.  This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.  Politics intrudes most in the final chapters.  For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as "peacenik", "peace offensive", and "red diaper baby."  But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war.  More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love.  Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage.  Strange...  Hey, some books should best be left to the pros.  Simple as that 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 I usually try to give everything I read a break, but this book was nothing new or exciting. It had a couple of briefly funny spots, but other than that, it was kinda blah. Maybe it would've been more exciting had I not read the Nanny Diaries a couple of years ago. This book did, however, give you insight into why some rich kids are so nuts - because they're nothing more than an accessory for their parents 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 OK, it's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember almost feeling tingles when I heard about it...I too, have thought that physics is the meaning of life, and I ADORE any considerate mediation on  relationships, but alas this book was horrible.  It may have been a huge  letdown because I was looking forward to it so much as I LOVED "The  Passion" and "Written on the Body".  I found this book to be  entirely tooooo tangental and poetic words leading into boxed up nothings 
 This book is horrible!  It is  uninsightful and utterly pointless.  The first 200 pages build an advertisement riddled case for healthy diet and exercise that leaves you less than conviced that John Gray has any idea what he is writing about.  Maybe there is a reason the U.S. has outlawed some of the treatments that are espoused with giving Mr. Gray his "insight" into what our bodies need?  The scientific data was never openly stated, but shrouded in mysterious, sensational statements such as "the same diet plan may cause a woman to gain weight and a man to lose weight."  This book left me wondering if John Gray actually believes this stuff or whether he is just trying to fulfill a book contract with his publisher.  I hope that this review does not dissuade you from ever purchasing a book by John Gray.  If you have never read "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" then I highly recommend that you purchase it and refer to it often.  It is a truly amazing and well written insight into the minds of men and women.  Check it out and leave this diet book on the shelf for someone else 
 if we could take off whenever we wanted and have access to funds to support our trip?  Most people wish to be:  Financially secure Have a loving spouse Beautiful (but too large) home Loving Daughter  What is she complaining about?  Nan can afford therapy. Get some and move on. 
 well, I was very disappointed with this book.  Full of "fill in the blanks and do your own math" it really had no BIG ideas to glean.  And I suppose I should not have been surprised that the underlying secret to retirement planning from Mr Schwab (who happens to be a guy who owns a stock brokerage business) is to be 90% invested in stocks FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!  Because you may live a very looooong time and you sure wouldn't want to OUTLIVE YOUR MONEY! The fill in the blanks forms were simplistic and the whole approach was nothing more nor less than you would learn when you meet with any run of the mill stock broker for the first time.  A bunch a estimates and blanks to fill in and no ideas beyond staying fully invested. Crap.   I truly expected and hoped for better... well, now I've got one to sell.  And no, I did not fill in the blanks already 
 I truly feel compassion for Dr. Gordon Livingston. Life has been difficult for him. I cant imagine the loss of two sons in just over a year. It has obviously taken an unfathomable toll on the heart of this loving father. I almost wish, because I felt his pain through the pages, that I could say that I don't understand. But because of his transparency, I think I do understand, at least a little bit.  I understand that Dr. Livingston is a man who lives with a deep pain that seeps out in most of what he does, including this book. I understand that Dr. Livingston simultaneously longs for the love of God and despises Him. I understand that Dr. Livingston, as a result of the many pains of his life, thinks more about death then most healthy people should.  As I put down his book, I prayed for him. I prayed that Dr. Livingston would come to know and understand the love of a God, that he would relate to a God who also watched a son die. I prayed that through that relationship with God he would become absolutely sure that he would one day hug his children. I prayed that he would be stripped of his intellectual arguments and allow himself to be vulnerable to a love and a peace that truly surpasses all understanding.  Though I can't recommend the book because of its strong bias against faith, a bias that seems to imply that faith is valuable for the sanity of the individual and not much beyond that, its overt sadness/focus on death/pessimism and its failure to really dig into a few critical subjects (like legacy, which he touches upon but doesn't explore deeply enough or as a piece of the puzzle that gives us hope), I truly wish Dr. Livingston the very best in this life and beyond... and there is a beyond, Dr. Livingston. Thankfully. 
      There is no scientific basis for the "Mozart effect,"  none at all.  The experiment in question was conducted on adults, not babies.   The results of that experiment implied that the subjects actively listening to music immediately before taking intelligence tests performed slightly better on those tests because they were more alert than the subjects who had been day dreaming in silence.         Those seeking scientific papers thoroughly debunking this silliness will find them in "The Biological Foundations of Music," published by the New York Academy of Sciences (ISBN 1-57331-307-6), which is currently out of print, but is probably available at your local library.          "Music, the Brain and Ecstasy" by Robert Jourdain is an excellent introduction to music cognition.  Howard Goodall's "Big Bangs" and Dowling and Harwood's "Music Cognition" can be purchased used and will be appreciated by advanced musicians and novices alike.          Parents wishing to introduce their children (and themselves) to music might consider purchasing "Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts," which are insightful and an absolute joy to watch.         Do not buy "The Mozart Effect."  It is a waste of your time and money.  Instead, just order some Mozart or Brahms or Bach, sit down, and listen to it:  you don't need Campbell's manipulative schlock to help you "unlock the creative spirit" within 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 Purchased this item, was thrilled that it was so inexpensive. Cable got here, I take it out of the package, it's too short to use with my Windows XP desktop PC, unless I want my iPod Nano sitting on the floor under and slightly behind my desk. It does work, but I've got a longer, better cable for that same purpose. But that's ok, we bought it as a second cable so that my husband can use it with his Apple iBook, and his Mac OS formatted iPod Video. So he plugged the cable into his iPod, and into every different USB port on his iBook... nothing happens. This cable is not compatable with Macs! If you're not a Windows user don't bother, it won't work for you! I had to get a refund for mine, the seller was nice enough to give a refund without my having to even send the cable back, since I suppose it would have ended up costing them more to reimburse me for shipping it BACK to them than it did to just give me my money back. The product page needs to specify that this is a Windows-only compatable cable. Although if I hadn't experienced it myself, I probably wouldn't have believed it, that a CABLE can work with one OS but not another 
 I've taken a couple film classes in college thus far and I have to say - this book is not very enlightening.  For the most part, this book takes concepts about film and assigns them terms to call them.  It spends a lot of time stating the obvious and little time going into any significant depth on any topic.  It is a long book full of general information that you will already know if you are a regular movie-goer, nevermind a student of film.  It lacks significant coverage of the history of film and is excessively verbose.  I recommend avoiding it if you can and not paying the full price if you must buy it for class.  You can learn far more about film simply by doing searches in Google.  The freely available information on the Internet far surpasses the mediocre offerings of this book 
 This book was rush-released in the wake of the 2004 election.  I found a copy at my local bookstore so soon after the election that I can only assume the publisher had already compiled the book on the expectation that Bush would take a second term.  It's a mix of actual pointers on getting through the second Bush term and a bunch of jokes designed to take some of the sting out of the fact that your candidate lost.  The problem is that it's so lightweight.  Sure, many of us who voted for Kerry could be well advised to join Moveon.org or do other largely symbolic actions, but then what?  Read Jared Diamond and watch Michael Moore?  That's just more of the same that hasn't worked before.  Mere protests and letters to our congressmen have been ineffective so far, so we need to figure out what comes next.  Frankly where the pointers for committed actions are concerned, we could have figured these out for ourselves.  And the jokes are funny.  I'll never say they aren't.  But as you read one Bush joke after another it's easy to become anesthetized.  When you laugh at something it's easy to feel superior to it, and when you feel superior to a problem it's easy to assume it's not your responsibility to do anything about it.  A few jokes are good to keep us from lapsing into hopelessness and despair, but with what we're offered here we're a lot more likely to lapse into jovial inaction.  The publisher of this book was smart enough to craft and push a book that taps into the frustrations of many of us feel as the second term drags on and on.  But this book is a clarion call to inaction, a guidebook for ideological sloth.  It encourages us to do the same as we've been doing, and not a lot of it either.  Sure, this book is funny, but it's unnecessary, and we can all do better than this if we really want to make things better 
 As I am reading this book, I'm going "huh?" and "what does that mean?" and "this is like poetry, apparently..."  I can't say I liked the writing style (such as it is), but it did create word pictures and pulses inside me despite my desire not to like the book!  It is a mood piece, at least to me.  Not a writer I would buy again though.  Sorry 
 Well, I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about Buddhism.  I did learn more, but it was painful.  The information in this book is valuable and important, but the book is poorly written and, frankly, boring.  I suppose that good writing is another aspect of worldliness that the authors have shunned 
 GOT IT FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER, SHE'S 6, SLING WOULD NOT HANG ON HER W/O TRYING TO DIG INTO HER THROAT, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, DOLL DID INTERACT WITH IT, IN RETROSPECT WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN. 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 The imagery of focused academia and the discontinuity of John and Carol's conversation can be defined as a constant stop n' go.  You find yourself wondering if the structure of "Oleanna" will transform a change of pattern from interupted dialog to a free flowing comprehensible conversation. You want to talk irritating-its all here.  John the ostentatious Professor is developed into this pompous character and Mamet creates a twisted tone of pathetic sympathy hitched with misappropriated authority. Will John's foolish indoctrination jeopardize his tenure?  If you can get through the continuation of interrupted dialog - lots of credit to you 
 I've been the owner of several Remington Express Sets in my lifetime.  All of them have worked wonderfully.  My issue with these rollers isn't their quality - they work excellently, heat up quickly and are very compact to store.  The only problem is that instead of pins, they come with clippy-type holders to keep them in your hair.  I suppose the clips would work okay if you have fine, short to medium length hair.  I have shoulder length hair that's not very thick, and the clip holders would not keep the rollers in my hair.   I could only put a VERY small section of hair around the roller if I had any hope of it staying put on my head.  Most of the time the clips would pop off and the roller would fall out if I so much as turned my head.  Remington has another set of compact express rollers called "All That", which are almost identical in function, only they come with pins instead of the clips.  If you're looking for something quality, compact and easy to use that will stay in your hair until YOU'RE ready to take them out, I'd recommend that set instead of this one 
 This is missing "Tapioca Tundra" & "D.W. Washburn"!  What's up with that?  What was Rhino thinking?  Just save up a few more bucks and go for the 4-cd box set.  That has everything and then some 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 In the Long Ago Far Away, I remember reading some of the Anita Blake series, but being no fan of mysteries or detectives I let the series fall by the wayside.  If a writer is truly great, then I can stay rivited even if the subject isn't one of my favorites.  I adore Faeries, to the point of practicing a post-modern version of Faerie Faith with no rules and no boundaries (and hence no obsessive traditionalism).  Ms. Hamilton now has fairies with no rules and no boundaries.  None.  Zip.  Nada.  Yet somehow, this is the inverse of liberating.  Oh, I am not surprised.  I have something of a fetish for well-written negative reviews, and reading some of the erudite, articulate attacks on Ms. Hamilton's writing have been illuminating.  I am fully aware of the direction taken by Anita Blake and I knew to expect it with Meredith Gentry.  So essentially, mixed blood fairy girl (1/2 Unseelie, 1/4 Seelie Brownie, 1/4 mortal - or some approximation of that mess) without the immortality gene runs away to escape torture at the hands of the Queen of the Unseelie Court, her Aunt Andais.  She becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles.  Auntie sends a few of her bodyguards to retrieve the wayward Princess Meredith and bring her back to the Court, where the Queen will make Merry an Offer She Can't Refuse.  Part and parcel with this offer comes the requirement to have sex with the Queen's Guards until she conceives, because a child will guarantee Merry the Throne.  Merry's competing with her cousin, Cel, who is under the same orders to produce a child.  And that's about it.  From some of the reviews here, I expected a lot more sex.  There are a few near misses and a few actual sex scenes, but they're nothing special.  The kink quotient is quite mild, comparatively speaking.  Even the scene that involves tentacles peters out to nothing.  It seems that, if the character is unattractive or undersirable in any way, Meredith will be spared sex with this fiend at the last minute, in the most contrived way possible.  Merry, apparently, doesn't take any for the team.  The most diffecult thing about reading Laurell Hamilton is the way she writes.  Her vocabulary seems very limited and the writing is quite repetitious.  Whenever someone bites/something stabs Meredith, the pain is described as "sharp and immediate."    "Burning and instantaneous" "Terrible and abrupt" "Stinging and urgent"  I'm not even trying.  Along with this limited vocabulary, Ms. Hamilton writes very much in passive voice.  Is, was, were, has, had, be, been, etc.  Dialogue is also stilted and awkward, with normal diction sometimes ignored to give a character an opportunity to say something "witty."  Characterization isn't a strong suit either.  Meredith is a little dull, but most heroines are.  Her sex partners all have nearly identical personalities, and I wish there had been some variety in the way Ms. Hamilton chose to describe them, rather than a run-down of features and attributes.  So why did I read it?  If I knew all this in advance, why did I even drop a dime on it?    I enjoy erotica, and, as previously mentioned, I'm a faerie fan.  I expected the writing to be terrible, but bearable enough for a few moments of shallow enjoyment.  Then I expected to come here, slap down a single star, and go on my merry way.  If at all possible, I am even more offended by the fact the most of Ms. Hamilton's ideas were good, but she blew it by not following through, or by failing to explore character emotion, or by making the plot secondary to the sex.  To have ideas that are actually interesting and then to drop the ball is even worse than having no good ideas at all (Anne Rice's "Beauty" series, *cough*cough).  But I can't give Ms. Hamilton one star, because the ideas were there, shining just below the surface.  The idea of fairies as celebrities in the mortal world . . . the concept of a fairie exodus to the United States . . . old gods becoming fairies . . . etc, etc . . .  So the book gets two stars, and it could have garnered more if Ms. Hamilton had her priorities straight.  1. Ms. Hamilton, you are a grown woman.  Mention the business parts of the male chracters by name please.  Obscuring gential terms with "him" and "himself" makes you look sqeamish and unsure of yourself.  If you want to write something with a little heat and intensity, clarify the act, please.  2. Thesaurus.  3. If you want all the sex, make the non-sexual parts longer so that they represent a plot.  4. Why is everyone so rampantly heterosexual, and horrified at the idea of homosexuality?  These are fairies, not humans.  Why would they possess our prejudices?  5. Let Meredith sleep with unattractive characters now and again.  Refusing to do so makes her seem like an elitist snob.  Enough complaining.   Look at the reviews and see if this is a mess you want to wade into.  I've started the second book, but after the first "sharp and immediate" there, I've set it aside until my annoyance ends.  If you want a modern fairy tale, try "Tithe."  It's considered YA, but it's far more satisfying than Merry Gentry's world. 
           Thankfully I got this book as part of a swap, and didn't pay anything more than postage for it. Cos it was a waste of Teri's time writing it, and a waste of my time reading it. I read to about page 50, and ended up even more depressed than I already was, so gave up.   This isn't a stereotypical biography. This is Teri Hatcher wallowing in self pity. Big time. It's nothing but saying how it's "tough" being a single mother, not getting many jobs until Desperate Housewives came along, how she didn't have any nookie with her husband on her honeymoon, how her husband doesn't love her, how's she divorced and over 40. Whoopee.   Don't buy this book. There's no juicy gossip about Lois & Clark (like, my favourite show ever!!!), and she's full of it. Blah, what a waste of time 
 DRG has reissued the 1964 Capitol recording of Kismet--and without apology. For fans of Gordon MacRae and Dorothy Kirsten, this may be cause for some rejoicing, but all others should beware. MacRae is all butch and blustery, and Kirsten sounds as if she is all too eager to return to the Metropolitan Opera. As MacRae combines the roles of the Hajj and the Caliph, and there is no one singing the Wazir, and the best music in the show, the quartet "And This is My Beloved," becomes a decidedly peculiar duet. The role of the sexpot wife of the Wazir, Lalume, is sung by a serviceable lady with the singular name of Bunny Bishop, conjuring images of a high-church cleric with astoundingly large ears.   There are at least four other Kismet recordings, the London studio cast with Valerie Masterson, a recent American studio recording with Samuel Ramey and Julia Migenes, the lamentable Vincente Minneli movie version starring Howard Keel, Ann Blyth, and Vic Damone, and, of course, the original Broadway cast album. The MacRae-Kirsten recording is arguably the worst, but the problem here really is that the original cast recording is so much better than any of the others that one has to wonder why they even bothered. Alfred Drake is stunning as the poet Hajj, Doretta Morrow heartbreakingly beautiful as his daughter Marsinah, a youthful Richard Kiley sings the bejesus out of the Caliph and, as Lalume, the treasured Joan Diener--who only recently left us to go sing with the angels--blows roof off with her several numbers. The MacRae-Kirsten recording cuts the score down to 10 numbers running just over 50 minutes, and the voices and general production values have a slapdash feeling that pales in comparison to the lush, sexy, funny and entirely satisfying original cast. For ardent fans of either of the singers, this is a chance to hear them at their prime, but all others would be wise to avoid this Kismet 
     Dershowitz' book is not so much a book about terrorism as it is specifically an attack on Palestinian terrorism and how terrorism relates to the US and our 51st state, Israel.  The author operates from the thesis of why terrorism is effective, and then proceeds to systematically discount every terrorist campaign in the world, leaving only the Israel - Palestine conflict and 9-11 for discussion.  One would expect to find more discussion on other conflicts such as those in Ireland or terrorist acts carried out by North Korea (the ultimate example of state-sponsored terrorism), but they are either nowhere to be found or completely dismissed.  Dershowitz carefully pares down his topic until he ignores practically everything in our century outside of 9-11 and the PLO.     His anti-Palestinian bias becomes more apparent later in his arguments.  His central idea is that terrorist groups feed off the success of other groups.  Because Palestinian terrorism is the most effective terrorist campaign in the world, for the sake of world security they must be defeated.  However, if you follow this logic it becomes apparent that he leaves no room for the possibility that the Palestinians might have a legitimate complaint or that perhaps they deserve certain rights that we in the US generally consider inaliable.  According to his argument, the Palestinians can never see any improvement in their situation, no matter how deserved, because such would be perceived as a victory for terrorism.  Therefore, as far as Dershowitz is concerned, they're just plain out of luck.     Dershowitz's attitude seems to be that the Palestinians should have tried nonviolent protest instead of violence.  He seems oblivious to the fact that the Israelis used violence to sieze Palestine in the first place, and while he admits that Israelis use terrorist-style violence, he never judges them in the same way he judges the Palestinians.    In fact, Dershowitz advocates the use of torture and assassination and seems to praise the Israeli use of these tactics.  I'm at a loss to explain how anyone can advocate nonviolent protest at the same time that they advocate assassination and praise 'preemptive' warfare.  I'm likewise unable to understand how anyone can caution us as to the steady erosion of our freedoms at the same time that they argue for state-sponsored torture.    To his credit, Dershowitz reminds us that even hated terrorists have constitutional rights, and he makes a plea for us to remember that even terrorists deserve due process of law.  But again, his hyprocrisy is stunningly blatant.  How can one argue for universal judicial fairness and advocate torture and assassination at the same time?  These concepts are completely antithetical to a fair, democratic judicial process.       The most frightening argument Dershowitz makes is that it is alright to allow our rights to be degraded as long as the "feel of freedom" is maintained.  (His words, not mine)  He claims that as long as our free speech is protected and our media is critical, it is alright for us to sacrifice our freedom in other ways.       In fact, Dershowitz admits that Palestinians in Israel are second-class citizens, and then says they should be thankful for it because Israel has free speech and a balanced judicial system.  I was previously unaware that bulldozing towns and bombing Palestinian civilians constituted a fair judicial system, and it really is a shame that too few Palestinians actually live long enough to enjoy it.     Anyone who reads this book should be frightened to live in a future Dershowitz America 
 Who can claim this is the ultimate book?  Who is the editors of homeowner?  I don't trust this book since I don't see an author's name attached.  Authors are more credible even though editors make more 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 This book is summarized in a single sentence "be a good teacher".  All the supporting comments should only take up a paragraph - not a  book.  And even then, every thing in the book is self evident and not really needed to be written down. The only people that should be interested in this are those in administration - for some obscure reason they seem to like rhetoric - then again - they are also usually diametrically opposed to the best interests of students and teachers 
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 Hard to believe this book is worse than "One Arrow, One Life..."...Kushner actually did a better job at explaining Kyudo & Zen, but fell short in other areas-(see my review of that book if you wish). In "Zen in the Art of Archery"  Herrigel is searching to understand Kyudo, he doesn't get it for a very long time. Example, I loved this line from the book..."I pointed out to the Master that I was already in my fourth year and that my stay in Japan was limited". Now that's funny. So he stayed on another 2 years. The "Master" is constantly running circles around him, e.g.,...Herrigel..."And who or what is this "It"?....The Master..." Once you have understood that you will have no further need of me..." This is painful mind drivel to read. Save your money. 
 I love dance music, techno music, remixed music, and Christmas music, but I cannot love this album.  Everytime I find a "remixed christmas" cd, I usually get it, just because I'm hoping someday there will be one that actually transforms traditional holiday songs into club anthems.  Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend.  They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer.  This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.  There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march.  It is so bad.  There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers "Christmas", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid.  If you don't believe me, listen to the samples, they won't lie to you 
 I was extremely interested in the subject matter since I dated a really nice Iranian man in college and had an interest in Iran, but this author came across so arrogant that I could barely finish the book.  When I finally managed to plow through it, I felt like taking out an ad against the book in the Washington Post, where I believe the author is affliated, as I have seen her listed as a book critic of all things--she generally attacks other writers & their books in reviews she writes--a lot of nerve under the circumstances.  A boring book that only irrtated me. I never return books to stores, but in the case I really felt like it.  I'm not surprised this book in the 100,000 rating.  Word gets around 
 Jackie is only in a brief clip in the beginning, stolen from the REAL Drunken Master.  This clip is entirely unrelated to the movie, and is very short.  Buy this if you want, but not because you think it has Jackie in it 
 I love Sophia Loren as an actress however this DVD as 3 movies in one package is a very very very poor quality DVD. Colors are bad, picture is bad and the sound is even worse. don't waste your money. My DVD copy was bought from Amazon.  this is my advic 
 What I learned in this book could have been placed on 1 page.  Sure, business life is a challenge and your competitors are not your friends, but this book did not deliver on facts and details.  I don't see much difference between this book and the guru-books 
 I LOVE Mannheim Steamroller.  Before this CD, I could honestly say they had not made one CD I didn't like.  The only music I did like on the CD was from other CD's I already owned. I felt fortunate since, when I took it back to the store where I'd purchased it, I told them I had played it but just didn't like it and was hoping they would give me a discount on another. They let me exchange it out right.  Very disappointing.  NOT typical of Mannheim 
 I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids.  4% Iron and no other vitamins??  With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
 The book is a long list of slide rule makers and models, from 1600 to today. There are short descriptions on slide rule technology at the begining of each section, but I expected a more detailed introduction and a shorter models and makers list 
 This is a poor remake of a classic.  I could barely sit through the thing.  The action scenes are good, yet unbelievable.  The sex seens with Alec and Kim are done well.  Otherwise, the movie sucks.  The basic plot is poorly laid out and therefore vaguely interesting, but the subplots are ridiculous.  Alec Baldwin does a crummy job of portraying the tough guy in this movie - he comes off arrogant and smug more than anything else.  Kim Basinger is great in her role, but overshadowed by the rest of the poor acting and stupid subplots that surround her.  Jennifer Tilly does a good job in an idiotic role.  If you want to see Kim Basinger naked, borrow this movie from someone else.  Bottom line - don't waste your money on it - you'll be mad at yourself if you do.  Only a complete idiot could enjoy this crummy film 
 The Big Apple definition in the book is wrong again.  Other guide books have it right, but LET'S GO just doesn't care about accuracy 
 I cannot recall when I have ever encountered so many "hypotheses," "supposes," "suggests," "probably" "calls to mind," etc. in such a short amount of space. More suppositions exist than theories, and those suppositions are based on highly dubious inferences. Damasio has obviously thought long and hard about his dysfunctional patients, and the fact that he wants to ground consciousness and emotions in neurobiology (as opposed to computers) gave me optimism and a tinge of excitement. Unfortunately, obfuscation prevailed.  Extrapolating hypotheses based on brain deficits and damage is one among many inductive means of substantiating theory. The problem, of course, is that exceptionalism usually doesn't define, it may, and I underscore may, posit evidence to support a hypothesis. But it is only one means of support. Just because the street is wet doesn't mean it just rained; someone could have watered the area with a sprinkler. It's this kind of reasoning that is most troublesome with Damasio's theories. By supposing that someone who lacks X must be caused because someone sustained Y doesn't entail that non-Y illustrates Z. Just because someone who suffered damage to frontal cortex lobe can't emote hate doesn't necessarily entail that the wholesome frontal cortex lobe is responsible for all emotions of hate. A correlation may or may not exist, but taking abnormal cases to instantiate normal cases is a spurious kind of inductive reasoning that permeates Damasio's "The Feeling of What Happens."  This kind of thinking leads to all kinds of problems. Because of curious abnormal instances, Damasio posits a need for three levels of emotion: primary, secondary, and background emotions. These distinction appear necessary because Damasio can detect in the laboratory of human psychological dysfunctions continue to operate in the presence of other human normal physiological functions. A correlation may or may not exist, but are abnormal cases instantiations of normal ones? Does the fact that certain physiological processes continue to operate in the absence of psychological ones indicate that the same qualitative emotion exists, but only on a different level? Either emotions exist in some sort of normal fashion, or otherwise produce examples from normal cases to substantiate theories of why a tripartite set of emotions is necessary. Why posit three levels of emotive activity, when one will clearly work (the scientific notion of parsimony)?   This same example can be leveled against Damasio's three levels of self and consciousness because of a disorder known as associative agnosia. So instead of positing consciousness as consciousness, Damasio posits the Proto-Self, Core Self, and Autobiographical Self which doubles for core consciousness and extended consciousness after the proto-consciousness. Whether all three levels of consciousness and self are really necessary depends on two things: (1) On Damasio's injured or ill patients as counter-examples of what normative existence entails, and (2) whether such an architecture serves to explain and predict what science ordinarily sets out to establish.   Let's just look at what Damasio's Proto-Self is intended to do. It is "a coherent collection of neural patterns which map, moment by moment, the state of the physical structure of the organism in its many dimensions" (p. 154). But by "neural patterns" he means only the "trigeminal nerve, the vagus complex, and the area postrema" (p. 155). Excluded are the "inferotemporal cortices, namely areas 20, 21, part of 37, 36, and 38" (p. 157). Let's take the obvious. What in the hell is Damasio describing? Maybe a neurochemist or neurobiologist knows what he's talking about, but I sure couldn't follow it. Second, we are told that it's not to be confused with homunculus. That's a relief. But whatever the Proto-Self is, "we are not conscious of the proto-self" (p. 174). So if we're not conscious of something nonconscious, how does it play a role in consciousness? By its physiological, not psychological, underpinnings?   Besides confusion, incoherence egregiously pervades the narrative beginning with Chapter Six. I became a bit suspicious of all the distinct levels of emoting, thinking, selves, etc, very early on, but I wanted to give Damasio an opportunity to explains his polysemous biological brain. But by Chapter Six, the book figuratively fell apart for me. By then clarity lapsed into ambiguity, polysemy lapsed into confusion, and the "Feeling of What Happens" lost all its interest. Sadly, not recommended.  Postscript: A 2006 New Yorker article describes hemispherectomies, the removal of entire halves of the brain. The practice is widely used in different conditions, usually involving seizures. The remarkable (and totally anti-Damasio) thing is that these people not only survive these radical surgeries, they usually resume ordinary day-to-day functions. According to Damasio's exceptionalism, the return to "normalcy" should not or cannnot happen. If the "location" of brain function is X, the removal X removes the corresponding function, according to Damasio, and thus that part of the brain cannot allow "extremities" to function. Removing entire halves of brains seems pretty radical and that surgurical "victims" survive is itself incredible, that they resume "normal" functions blows Damasio's entire hypothesis of particular brain functions out of the water. How does Damasio account for the fact that the removal of the entire halves of brain does NOT impair function that he claims a tiny excision must and ordinarily would cause 
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 This book has some valid points about the way some parents raise their children, however, the solution it offers is not what it claims to be. It is, rather, a reaction to permissive parenting books and a return to raising kids the way Grandma used to do it. Her Grandma, I should say. It's not about doing things according to our instinct, but hers. It is nothing but the same old tired advice from the fifties- if you pick up your baby too much, the baby will become demanding. Tell your kids to leave you alone, etc. It sounds like the author was fed up with trying to be a better parent (and maybe she truly did try too hard at the expense of herself) but then has overcompensated and adopted the attitude of "I'm too busy to try to do a good job so I'll do whatever I want and my kids will turn out just fine." In spite of what she says, it does matter what you say to your kids, how you phrase it, and how you react to their feelings. But discipline is important, too. And you shouldn't drive yourself crazy worrying about every little thing you do. Every parent needs to find their own balance.  This is just another parenting book, disguised as an anti-parenting book. 
 I returned this phone after one week. Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you can't assign specifice ring tones to phone number. Ear piecs sound quality is marginal. text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small. The back panel display is too small and hard to read. 
 Of the Carlotta mysteries I've read so far, this is easily the weakest effort.  I've often read aloud from some of the other novels in this series to my partner.  The language in this particular novel is somewhat awkward and doesn't roll of the tongue easily like some of the other novels.  The plot plods along and the supporting characters are dull and uninteresting.  I've never felt that the Carlotta's blues hobby was very realistic and it certainly can't hold a novel together. Even the appearance of Carlotta's ex-husband doesn't spice things up much.  Perhaps I have a bias against musicians (the ones I've known have generally been narcissistic and boring).  Syncronistically, just before this novel, I had just read the Sue Grafton novel in which Kinsey's musician ex-husband makes an appearance.  However, Sue Grafton makes it work and really uses his appearance to reveal something about Kinsey's character.  In Steel Guitar, the ex is just someone else for Carlotta to boink.  I've only managed to plod through about three quarters of the novel.  I just don't really care very much how it turns out 
 I discarded the DVD after watching it. If you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home don't buy this version of The Secret Garden. 
      The basic problem with this economics textbook is that Mankiw is unable or unwilling to present an analytic,technically sound exposition ,at the Principles level, of the fundamental theoretical difference separating Keynesian and Neoclassical(Classical)economists in 1936 or today.These differences appear in the paradox of thrift.I have already covered this in my review of Samuelson's classic 1948 first edition.Basically ,neoclassicals argue that the economy is naturally selfadjusting under conditions of resource scarcity.Assuming two types of goods and industries,consumption and investment,any type of private sector miscalculation and/or forecast error of the composition of the product mix that businessmen sell is self correcting by means of inventory adjustment.Too many consumption goods and too few investment goods will lead to an inventory adjustment via the Invisible Hand that results in less consumption goods and more investment goods.There is an inverse relationship between the two sectors of the economy.Unfortunately,such an inverse relationship only obtains if the economy is operating on the boundaries of both the static and dynamic production possibilities frontier(ppf) curves.This requires that business forecasts of their capital stock(factories,plants and equipment)are always correct.In general,the private sector is operating in the interior of both ppf's due to the problem of insufficient investment in infrastructure because the capital stock can't be adjusted in the face of constant innovation,advance,and technological change.The physical capital stock is cast in concrete;it is irreversible,irrevocable and industry specific.This explains why investment is unstable,volatile and unpredictable over time while consumption is stable,predictable and nonvolatile.There is no tradeoff between the two kinds of very different goods.It is interesting that the "real options" theory of Dixit and Pindcyk has come to many of the same conclusions without citing either Samuelson or Keynes.However, there is a solution.Increased public sector investment in needed infrastructure will,through the multiplier process,generate additional income and sales that will create positive expectations of future expected profits for the private sector.This will lead the economy back towards the boundary of both ppf's where the neoclassical marginalist calculus of rational utility and profit maximizers would again become operational.This is the message of both Paul Samuelson and John Maynard Keynes.Mankiw never presents this position in a coherent fashion anywhere in his textbook.The result is that users of Mankiw's book will never have any idea of what set off the Keynesian Revolution and why macroeconomics is splintered 
 There are a lot of really bad books on portrait painting, and this is definitely one of them.  If Amazon was giving this book away, I would not want one.  There is really no instruction to speak of in this book.  The style is also pretty boring, and lifeless.  The type of uninspired, realism, and bad painting so typical of American Artist magazine.   Instead buy any of the Charles Reid books, but his Natural way to paint is the best for portrait painting.   ...Okay, maybe I have been a little harsh.  If you took this book, and stacked it up with some other bad art books, you could angle your watercolor board, and paint in the style of Charles Reid.  So, I guess it isn't worthless, just not very good 
 THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD. I WILL SUGGEST THAT NEXT ONE WILL BE TESTED AND MAKE SURE IS PLAYING VERY WELL IN VIDEO AND AUDIO.      THANK YOU. 
 I LOVE Elizabeth Berg.  While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing.  I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life.  I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that.  I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said "Wow - she is SO right!"  I also don't like books from a child's point of view.  I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.  If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her.  She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel 
 This product is absolutely useless.  Save your money.  The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it.  In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever.  So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around.  So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout 
 This book was written in 1993. While reviewing it, I noticed just how wrong the details are. Compare the details in this book to some of the brand name products. MANY are lower in fat, or calories, etc.   Foods change over the years. Believe me when I say, you want the most current and comprehensive reference when it comes to a food almanac.   Do not bother with this. It is now a paper weight, nothing more. There are better choices. Go to a local book store, peruse the many selections and select a CURRENT and comprehensive guide. Do not go for the CARB hype books. You need to know all the basics at the very least...protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium, and a guide that breaks down the types of fat would be the best...as long as it is current!! 
 The book is entertaining, however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent ANY time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events, biblical texts, and blatantly stretched (pun so intended) the truth on so much.  I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.  If you take away any claim of being a historical reference, this book is good.  It's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does.  Totally not serious, but a giggle to be had here and there.  Some of which is at the author's expense 
 A collection of short essays, most of which consist of little more than psychobabble. Get it through the public library - don't buy it 
 I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us. However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning.   "In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. My first studies involved a few hundred "experts"--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred."  I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and "optimal experience". Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years. That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness.   It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness. 
  The book is manipulative and unrealistic. I felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey, betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend.  Definitely one of the shallowest books I have ever read.  I bought the book as it was rated as a "best seller" , and I was stuck in an airport for hours on end. The entire plot is hideous as the "burned best friend" makes up reasons why it's accept able to betray her best friend. If I was not completely bored, I would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages. 
 If the point of your homeschooling is to honor Christ, this is not the book for you.  I ended up throwing it away because I would not want to donate it 
 Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.  In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)    The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- "Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again," attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.   Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.   
 When I heard the song "I WOn't Stand In LIne" I thought to myself...neither will I...meaning "I Won't Stand In LIne" to buy any of this lady's music!!  This CD has some of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life like the one above, "I Wouldn't Wanna Be You", and "Everything You Want".  "Why Haven't I Heard From You" gets on my last nerve!!  There really is not much redeemable about this release.  Its got a nice cover with a flattering picture of Reba on the front of it but that's about it!!  Read my mind....it stinks! 
 While I  liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent) 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 I was so fascinated by the first two novels I couldn't wait to get this one.  Yet it is a prequel and really meanders around, then rushed the ending to try and make the connections back to the first two books 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 After reading the reviews on this book, I decided on the spot to order it.  Although it has many thought-provoking questions in it, they definitely arn't life changing.  It is a decent book, but it didn't meet my  expectations.  If you are a very religious or spiritual person, this may be  your style 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 In fact, I'd say it's their worst.  While I can listen to a couple songs off it, I don't go out of my way to do so.  This is just overall a pretty bad album.  After their last album ("Year of the Spider"), I knew this was coming.  I hate to say it, but they're done.  If you want to hear Cold when they were good, listen to "13 Ways to Bleed Onstage".  I'd stay away from this one 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 I ordered an HP printer, which does not come with a cable, on Oct. 17th.  Based on advice in the ad for the printer, I ordered the subject cable, also made by HP, in the same order.  The printer shipped on the 19th of October.  An ink cartridge for the printer arrived Nov. 15th, but I have not received the cable.  I do not know how to rate the printer or the cable and I have already lost 30 days on the printer's warranty!!  I sure would like to be able to rate the cable and printer.  To date the order is 2 weeks late since it's estimated shipping date of Oct 28 - 29.  I have not even been able to find a way to contact customer service to see if there is going to be a long lag time, in which case I would know that it would be wise to cancel and order from someone else.  Bottom Line:  Not satisfactory at the moment 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 What a piece of garbage.  With books like these, Darwinists have nothing to worry about.  Evolution is a fact, period.      
 if you don't like hip hop and have such a negative response why do you listen to it why do you care. these artist make more money than your ma and pa will ever make and you too. go listen to the soundtrack to brokeback mountain i'm sure there is a lot you'd like there. numnut 
 This is another interesting book that could have been a 5 to 10-page brilliant article. Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on... But I am glad I read this book. There is only one issue I wish was addressed. Being frugal and living below your means is good. After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth? I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book. Instead, it looks like the "pursuit of wealth" is a constitutional obligation of every citizen 
 I thought the case was nice looking, but when actually using it, I was very dissapointed.  The case is not secure at all, it keeps sliding off.  If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle, I do not recommend the aluminum case 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 Unfortunately, this freshman effort from writer/director Maria Maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism.   Littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances, "Two Girls in Love" is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment.   For a more believable (as well as more intelligent and erotic) young lesbian love story, check out the understated and off-beat BBC production, "My Summer of Love" (2004). A similarly themed film that's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- "But I'm A Cheerleader" (1999) is a gem. From the same year, "Better Than Chocolate" has it all - humor, originality, plot, dialogue, performances, and sensuality.   The only incredible thing about "Two Girls in Love" is that it got released in the first place, as without its lesbian twist it's little more than a third-rate Romeo and Juliet tale 
 I really like Levine's book Ella Enchanted. But I would not recommend The Wish for adults, let alone children. It is too vulgar 
 The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds.   My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you 
 Monster should seriously be ashamed of themselves for praying on people who don't know about home theater. If you're already getting a picture using a cheap $5 HDMI cable, without and "sparklies" and without the picture blanking out intermittently, then that's literally as good as it gets and you'd be better off saving up for a better DVD player rather than stuff like this.  Next thing you know, Monster will be selling $200 iPod USB cables and claiming that they make the music sound better - it's the same principle 
 This books starts with such promise but I find it hard to believe that the people who wrote the glowing reviews were actually able to slog through it! Minutiae-fest 
 ... if Coppola and Williams had at least made a single mention of progeria.  What's progeria, you say?  Well, it's this very real, rare disease that causes children to age 10 years for every year they live.  Of course, they don't look like an average adult, but then Robin Williams wouldn't have been able to run around acting like a kid for a couple of hours.  However, if the crew had used the comedy aspects to hook viewers, and then give them information about progeria at the end, I would have been okay with it.  But since they didn't, I will: http://www.progeriaresearch.org/.   
 Not sure if all pumps are this loud...but goodness this one is so loud it hurt my ears...also the attachments that come with it (for different size holes) are not affixed to the pump so you have to hold the attachments on the blower while it is filling up the item and the cord is not on the side of the pump, it's on the bottom so you cannot even set the pump down while it is inflating the item. It is just a bit awkward.  I used it to blow up an inflatable Castle for my 20 month old and there are several areas to blow up and some of them are a bit awkward and trying to hold the pump AND hold the attachments on the pump with one hand was a bit aggrevating 
 The 1981 release Great Gonzos The Best of Ted Nugent covers Nugent's classic period. Most listeners may only be familiar with a couple of the songs on the album. "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Stranglehold" are probably Nugent's best known songs. I'm not a big fan of Ted Nugent, so I'm really only interested in the hits. Great Gonzos contains all of Ted Nugent's hits, as well as quite a few songs that weren't hits. Great Gonzos is probably all the Ted Nugent most casual fans will need 
 This toy is really rude! It says "Outta the way" and other very rude phrases. I can't believe anyone would produce a toy like this and think it was okay. This toy got a home at the bottom of a garbage can 
 Only useful information in the book is when he tells you to buy "The Expert at the Card Table"  This guy wrote this book as nothing more then a means to brag. His stories aren't interesting enough to save the book 
 I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel? GRAB THE READER ON THE FIRST PAGE! This book never did. I'm not sure how people can rave about the great writing - it just isn't there 
 This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
 Ab Lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna Belt(import junk). Direction manual is almost useless, does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used. You will need to look at TV commercials,and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together. Their web site is no help 
 We know Rita Mae can write.  I remember one Thanksgiving years ago reading parts of one of her books aloud to my sisters and all of laughing so hard we cried.  She had captured reality and presenting it wondrously.  This book however shows none of that talent.  Most of the dialog comes across as extremely stilted and unrealistic 
 i bought these phones..... very expensive to start with, but i was willing to pay because quality usually is something you have to pay for. they worked well at first. it took about 8 months to really have a problem with them, but when it rained it poured. i have sent back 2 out of 3 phones that i got and with the replacements they sent me  3 dont work out of the 3. uniden is replacing my entire set because they are under warranty but i shouldnt have to send back 2 out of 3 in under a year. lets see, the one is totally not usable. doesnt turn on , different batteries dont fix the problem...completely useless. the other one, the battery dies after literally 3 minutes of talking , and the third just shuts off in the middle of a conversation with no warning, then flashes on and off. like i said, i contacted uniden through email and i am getting replacements. maybe i just got a bad set. until they broke i liked them a lot. but i dont think id recommend them after having all the problems i did. 
 I bought this while in Philadelphia, and it was terrible except one song which I played endlessly for about a day and a half before I got tired of it, and this would eventually end up on the soundtrack of the film "Clerks" which was "Got Me Wrong". This was a noble attempt of showing that they can do acoustic as well as electric, but it didn't help if the songs weren't strong enough. 
 Don't waste your money. One of the few badly made LeCrueset products (I'm a huge fan of their enameled cast iron.)   Get a plain stainless steel one with a rolled edge or straight edge instead. There's quite a few well made ones out there. All Clad makes an excellent one, so does Tramontina, Analon, and Revereware (to name a few). Get a solid metal lid.  The metal band on this pot will over time create a sharp edge where it's joined. No fun to encounter when washing it. The enamel coating needs to be treated very carefully as well. This stock pot is just not a work horse to last a lifetime. A good quality 18/10 stainless steel stock pot is a much better choice. It'll take a beating and then some. This one won't 
 I enjoyed the first half of this book very much, but by the time I got to the end 100 pages I was very very bored.  It dragged on to me once he grew up and became what he did, the ending didnt suit me  because I felt like I needded more.    Plus I felt it had this strong side towards all african american's being this poor race, with poor chances (the father, his girlfriend,Monique,the thug street boys, on and on and on)  and then the white folk all being depicted as these white tennis playing rich folk with everything going for them.   It had a very sterotypical sort of edge to it, all the way down to the nanny from korea  The "brothers' was a nice tie and how it didnt matter who was what, they were brothers.  Other then that I felt this troublesome matter on what black and white see each other as, when we should be what the brothers see each other as.  One family, one people, nothing less  I feel like I missed a lot, ans also like thomas couldnt really fit in one or the other he was just kinda this special being who got caught up in the wrong thing, and with bad luck 
 Every thing works well enough with the exception of the HDMI terminals that were not functional correctely as I recieved the Sharp Aquos LC32D42U LCD HDTV.  The picture blinks on and off when I used either of the two HDMI terminals for input from my Direct TV HD receiver.  Toke some effort to get Sharp arrange warrenty repair.  It is still in the shorp.  Hopefully it will get fixed soon.  Aother feature that is missing from this TV is the option of elimating weak stations ater auto tune 
 After reading reviews I had imagiend this book to be a master piece.  After received I was simply not impressed.  Many of the photo's focal point was illy placed in the binding.  A lot of photos were blown up to the point of distortion.  None were that breath-taking.  You'd be better off buying a book with photos by Oliver Tollmi 
 i read this book the reveng of the whale.it is about a huge sperm whale that attacks a ship that is trying to capturen it.they are trying to kill it beacuse of the sperm oil it has.they bring it back to land and sell it.i didnt like the book becase it didnt really have a main charecter.all it talked about is what the ship did and how they capiutur the whales.i also didnt like it because i thought it was going to have more action in it.most of the time ther just sailing and not really doing anything really exiting.it also dont really have a story line all it talkes about is what the ship is doing.it has no charecter conflicts.i was expecting more fights seenes with the whale and i would have hopped the would have discribed the whale better and how it attacked the ship more.some of the things i did like about it was it had one vwery god part in it.when the capterd one of the whales.it told how the got it and what they had to do to get it.i also like the pictures in the book it showed what the whales looked like and all the tools they had.i really didnt like this book but if you read it mabey you will u might be suprised 
 congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades 
 I was very disappointed with this machine. My brand new X5 leaked water from the first day. Talked to the company's US service center (don't bother email, she will just tell you to call and it is a one person operation); service center person said it was probably a gasket and that she would send a replacment, but they were on backorder. Makes you think they are having other problems besides me! Also, I found the product manual to be poor (why does it take THREE manuals, plus 1 photocopied insert to find the information you need to set up?). The crema was dark, but that may have had more to do with the leakage of water.   It is a pretty machine, but nothing else was pleasing about it.  Update: Six weeks later, the company sent a replacement washer for me to repair the machine with. Of course, I had long since returned it to Amazon, who quickly credited my card.  
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 A glossy book, tourist-type pictures, little practical information, and very limited sicussion of the Galapago 
 I love the show The Medium, and expected a really fascinating story of the author Allison DuBois.  Unfortunately this was very generic... her psychic experiences often were described so vaguely they just didn't impress (so, when she was on her bike as a kid and two shady guys tried to get her to accept a ride home, she heard a voice yelling LEAVE NOW?  uh... that's your subconscious, not a ghost).  She's a beautiful lady as the book jacket shows, but what was most interesting, like the fact that her mother kicked her out of the house while she was still in high school because the mother remarried, are glossed over.  The book ends with some kind of television audition but it's for a show called "oracles" and the story of how The Medium came to be is not in the book.  Much of the book seems to be a self-help book for budding mediums, but since I'm not, I didn't need advice on how to react to my experiences... I just wanted to hear more about hers.  Not much personality came through and ultimately this was a disappointing, and dull, read 
 Wow how the hell someone can watch this a think it was good just boggels my mind.  I've seen this piece of crap two times once by accident and i couldnt turn it off cause i was laughing so hard at how pathetic it was. The second time because it was on H.B.O and i read the previous reviews that said it was an awesome movie and had to see if i was just mistaken.  OH MY GOD the acting , directing and visual affects is probably the worst i have seen in a while.  It make little nickey or overdrawn at the memory bank look like  5 star movies.  The dialoue is so ridiculous there where tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.  My favriote scene has to be where king arthur and is men charge a semi truck .  Also when lancalote and merlin go for a ride on a water slide in a cavern is also pretty damn funny.  So kuddos to the director and writer for making the worst movie of all time. So well played Phil Matthews for creating the the filmthe brings face back to adam sandler for doing little nicky or the Raul julia for doing overdrawn at the memorey ban 
 This book was a disappointment. I bought it because I wanted to read about all the interesting women it claims to be about: Nancy Mitford, Ninon, many others. But it is not about them. It is about the author. Once in awhile she thinks about one of these women, and gives you her thoughts. But she doesn't tell you much about the women. You are left still wanting to know the lives and loves of the famous women of Paris. This book is for people who really want to know what the author thinks about Paris, but I don't know her and I'm not interested in what she thinks, nor when she feels tired, when she wants to lie down, what she eats, when she travels on the Metro, what she says to her friends. I wanted to read about what the charming and fascinating women of Paris said and thought. 
 Why? Because this book, as well as Universe in a Nutshell, and A Briefer History of Time, are nothing more than slightly modified versions of A Brief History of Time. Hawking provides nothing additional to what he's already published so don't waste your time & money.  
 Pleasant movie but nothing special, a very ordinary story. Audrey Hepburn's charisma is what puts some life to the movie. Some subtle humour though 
 As a psychiatrist and person with mentally ill family members, I can only bemoan all of the misinformation contained in this book. The truth is that many of the mentally ill in America do not get the treatment they need precisely because they believe the things said in this book, on tv, etc. As someone who has lived outside of the US and in the developing world, I can tell you that their mental health treatment pales compared to what is available in the United States and is much more primitive and coercive. Although it is true that many psychiatric medications have serious side effects, the consequences of living with symptoms of a serious mental illness can only convince you of how devastating that can be to both the ill person and his or her family. Furthermore, as someone who is also experienced in administering ECT, I can personally attest to the wonderful success rate of this treatment for persons with severe depression who have failed all alternatives and who would rather be dead than live out their lives. (And many, unfortunately, do decide on death as a last resort).  As far as lobotomies, ice baths, and forced stays in hospitals or other facilities, these are things of the past in the United States. In fact, one of the biggest problems I face in my practice is the extreme difficulty I have in placing someone in the hospital when they actually need a brief stay (typical stays are 5-7 days) because of a lack of psychiatric beds ( more than 90% of psychiatric beds were eliminated from American hospitals in the last 15 years as a cost-cutting measure). The other problems faced by modern psychiatry still includes stigmatisation of the mentally ill and then all the more mundane issues such as needs for help with housing, employment, and job development. But I bet you wouldn't find the author writing a book about that 
 This is DFW show-off opus, where he uses verbosity to club the reader over the head until they are senseless and *think* they really understand what he's talking about.  I wonder if this whole work is a cruel joke; to see if we "get it".  This is a book to tackle (and I mean that word) when you're stranded on a desert island with no other choices.  Otherwise pick up one of his collections of non-fiction 
 Just get this book and I don't think it worth the price I paid for it. They don't cover the basic of the software suite. Don't buy this book 
 I agree with the reviewer who felt that Ms. Shires's textual analysis didn't flow well.  I found the majority of this book to be rather dull, tedious, slow-going, and uninvolving.  It was an original idea to tell the story of her conversion by relating issues she had difficulty with or areas she found inspiration in to certain passages of Torah and the similar writings of others, but it just didn't seem executed well.  If this is supposed to be a conversion memoir, why does so little of the book actually concern her conversion or even her herself?  The sections when Ms. Shires is writing about herself, such as in the beginning section, the ending chapter about her visit to her husband's native Germany, and the middle chapter about the mikvah, are quite good and interesting, because they're actually related to her life and to her conversion and not just tediously rambling on about certain Torah passages.  From reading this, it seems as though she were the classic child who does not know enough to ask.  She says she did a lot of reading prior to her conversion because she really wanted to know the religion and to approach it from a variety of disciplines, but in many sections she admits that she didn't know about some pretty important things or issues till after she converted.  For example, she says that she hadn't had a lot of education about the mikveh and had been too embarrassed to ask her converting rabbi, and therefore went into her conversion day feeling she had to immerse herself because she was thought to be "contaminated" and "dirty" as a non-Jew and had to cleanse herself before being admitted to the tribe.  How could anyone in any denomination, particularly if she's had such a long process of education and learning as Ms. Shires evidentally had, reach conversion day thinking such a thing and not having learnt more about the custom of mikveh?  (I was also annoyed that her chapter on the mikveh used the dated and inaccurate translations "contaminated" and "unclean" for the Hebrew words "tumah" and "tamei."  That continues to give the completely false impression that menstruating women are thought to be dirty and unclean, when in actual fact the words surrounding this state of being are translated more like "ritually impure," and the impurity refers to a spiritual, not a physical, state of being.)    I was also left wondering why she converted under the auspices of the Conservative Movement when she so clearly feels ill at ease with many of their official positions, or at least the positions her own community seems to take.  She really seems like she'd feel more at home in a Reform, Reconstructionist, or Renewal community.  I'm also baffled as to why she frequently says that the Conservative Movement hasn't done enough for the inclusion of gays and women, unless her community isn't as liberal as many other Conservative communities are.  Or are the changes of the past few decades not radical and sweeping enough for her?  I also share her belief that women, gays, the disabled, and other groups that traditionally haven't always been included fully in Jewish life need to be completely integrated and granted full equality and participation in the community, but at times her call for this reads more like a political polemic and speaking from personal experience as opposed to really representing the great strides the Conservative Movement has made in these areas in the past few decades.  I'm not doubting her personal experiences with people she's known and what she's dealt with in her own community, but it just seems baffling if she's trying to say the entire Conservative Movement takes those positions as well.  A couple of interesting chapters do not a very recommendable book make.  Most of this was just very slow going for me, and the divrei Torah weren't that novel or insightful either.  I've heard most of these interpretations and analyses before, only not in such dull language.  I'm actually disappointed I bought this book, though at least I got a cheap used copy.  I'd looked forward to reading a conversion memoir, but instead got a tedious exercise in boredom that had almost nothing to do with the author's life, either before, during, or after her conversion 
 This book is very much for the Cosmo mag crowd, I'd suggest getting another book if you do not fit into that category. And if you do fall into the crowd, after you read this one you really should check out better books on this subject with more helpful info (even if it isn't as cute). 
 I have had several people take my pictures.At first,everything is fine.The pictures are ok.THE NEXT DAY,my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.It is soooo blury.Then it got 2 the point where every picture I took was blury.I tried fixing it online(like on the program for the camera)and it would not work.I HATE THIS CAMERA!!! Not to mention the battery sucks.It lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.This camera should be $99.00.TRUST ME PEOPLE......IF I COULD RATE THIS THING AT A ZERO I WOULD.IT IS NOT WORTH IT.HOWEVER,a camera i absolutely love is the Sony Cybershot DSCT5.An awesome little camera 
 She is a LIAR!  John 3:13 "No man hath ascended unto heaven except He who came down from heaven"  Acts 2:34 "David has not ascended unto heaven" Hebrews 11:39 "none of the patriarchs have received the promise"  This book is just more fantasy propaganda from the church of Mystery Babylon, Mother of Harlots.  This is damnable heresy from a false prophet (2 Peter 2:1)   
 I've been struggling to finish this book for over 3 months. A book of this length would typically take me a week to finish. This book, however, seems painfully endless. This was my first adventure into the world of biographies. I warn others who may choose this book as their first biography, STOP, put the book down and look for some other biography. However, if you want boring account of Natalie Wood's script selection, give Lambert's book a try, at the very least you can use it to treat insomnia. Lambert has done a grave injustice to such a fascinating Hollywood icon. 
 This book was quite disappointing.  The writing is fair, but very dry. The text is filled with VERY well known stories, and I learned almost nothing I didn't know from other books I have read.  Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Instead read Chernow's masterpiece "Alexander Hamilton," and find a good book on Madison - you will learn so much more that way 
 I watched this movie with great anticipation. It is very well acted and starts out great. It's the story of a young Spanish woman who comes to America to star in movies. She has had an extremely hard life and wants to get away from it all. She becomes an overnight star and has everything, except love. She meets and falls in love with a Count and that's where the story goes horribly wrong. Basically, she finds out, on their wedding night, he can't fufill her in marriage, so she has an affair. She gets pregnant, which she is excited about, and then her husband finds out about the affair, but not the pregnancy, and kills her and the man she has the affair with.  It was a horrible ending to an, otherwise, great movie. 
 I don't normally write reviews on Amazon without having read the book.  However, in this case I'm going to make an exception because of the factual misinformation and distortion, not only from the book but the reviews themselves.  First, a word on my qualifcations.  In addition to possessing both a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation as well as a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) degree, I have managed portfolios for 2 decades, including in excess of a billion dollars for individuals and institutions.  As for the comments offered by some reviewers:  (1)	Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.  There are no vested benefits as with private retirement accounts (defined benefit or defined contribution).  All future benefits depend on the promise of politicians - some in office today, some in office 50 years from now.  You may find this reassuring - I don't.  (2)	Privatization does not mean investing 100% of your FICA contributions into stocks.  It means having the CHOICE of investing in stocks, bonds, CD's, treasuries, etc.    (3)	Nobody says that earning 7-8% in excess of inflation is necessary for privatization to work.  If stocks can return 6-8% nominally over the next 10-30 years, and if bonds return 4-6%, then privatization makes sense for most people.    (4)	The real return on Social Security contributions for anybody reading this review who is under 50 years of age is close to 1% a year.  For anybody under 30 years of age, the real return is probably negative.  (5)	Some people should NOT leave the Social Security system even if it was allowed; I know this is true because I understand the basics of financial planning.  Individuals who are risk-averse, who do not have other defined benefit pensions, and who have minimal other assets might prefer the security of a traditional Social Security pension to investing in private accounts, even with a lower assumed rate of return.  That said, the benefits should still be accrued and have more of a vested property right than the current system.  (6)	Proposals to rescind tax cuts or to increase the wage base upon which the FICA tax is levied are nothing more than socialist band-aids designed to prop up a failing system.  It's like saying that there was nothing wrong with Enron that a $20 billion bailout from the government couldn't fix.  Increasing FICA taxes or the wage base would be a massive tax hike on small businesses and middle-class Americans.  Bill Gates and Warren Buffet aren't affected by FICA - working class and middle class American are.  (7)	Many American families pay $10,000 - $20,000 a year in FICA taxes to Social Security.  For them, this is a lousy deal.  Nowhere in these books do the authors even attempt to show how Social Security is a good deal - because they can not.  The only people for whom Social Security is a good financial deal are lower-income Americans, those with dependents, and those who tap the disability fund because of health reasons.  If the government wants to continue this safety net for them, fine.  But why should the rest of us have to suffer?  (8)	I have run the calculations for some current Social Security retirees who started receiving benefits in the last 5-10 years.  For almost all of them, they would have done better in a classic pension-style 50-50 asset split between stocks and bonds with their FICA contributions than sending it to Washington politicians.  In some cases, the monthly benefits would be 3X higher than they receive right now from Social Security.   Prior to 1983, all municipal and state employees had the option of opting out of Social Security and having their employer set up private-accounts (a few did).  The reason that was not extended to private employers is because the private sector (employers and the financial industry) did not at that time have the mechanisms in place to offer the choices available today:  401(k)'s, ESOPs, Roth IRA's, thrift saving plans, etc.  The 1983 Greenspan Commission eliminated the municipal/state opt-out; it should be rescinded and extended to the private sector, as well.  Social Security reform needs to have only four basic planks:  ·	Allow any individual to opt-out of the current system, with accumulated benefits frozen.  ·	Individuals who prefer the current system of a defined benefit plan with a guaranteed payment at retirement can stay in the current system.   ·	Individuals can elect to save the entire 12.4% of FICA taxes in domestic and global asset allocation stock and bond mutual funds, treasury bonds, or bank CD's.  They would also be allowed to save half their FICA taxes in personal Social Security Retirement Accounts (SSRA's) while sending the other half to continue funding a reduced Social Security benefit. ·	Any shortfall in revenues will be met out of general revenues, which can easily finance the shortfall from individuals opting out of Social Security by instilling spending limitations on future spending.  As I have stated, not everybody should have private accounts, even if they were made "dummy proof" so as to practically insure long-term positive real returns.  The current system takes so much in FICA taxes from individuals that they cannot meet basic living expenses and save money in an IRA because they don't have enough money left after all their taxes.   This is grossly unfair.   All for benefits that are not defined, have no vested property rights, and which could theoretically be eliminated in the future for any individuals based on their future income levels or the whims of Congress.  This is the real outrage - not the Bush plan, which despite it's many flaws, is at least a step in the right direction. 
 should both teach and delight.  The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not.  therefore, two stars 
 I went into this movie not expecting anything special. I had read the reviews and got a mixed feeling. I decided to go for it... I wish I hadn't. I couldn't even finish watching the movie it was so bad. Characters popping out of nowhere and having no purpose. Almost each and every scene could be given an award as worst scene in any movie if that award was given. I had read that some of the scenes were beautiful. All right, I suppose, the scenery perhaps... but the acting was awful. Even if I like an actor I try not to be bias and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek are not bad actors, if I remember correctly. This was laughable. Sutherland's role had no purpose. It was well acted, but it meant nothing.  The story didn't work; it just didn't flow well. I felt almost... tipped while watching it because everything was off. No one is seriously offended and then swoons over the one who did the offending; not in a matter of a few seconds anyway. The story moved so fast and was so crooked that I called it quits before I squirmed through anymore of the Razzie worthy scenes 
 Sorry to say I am not thrilled with MHC's books anymore. Years ago I thought they were riveting. But lately, they characters are very flat and don't develop much at all. I didn't find the characters to be believable at all. It seemed Kay somehow found herself married to accused murderer Peter shortly after meeting him without witnessing how they became close enough for that. I got bored, put down the book to read another, came back for a second try but found I just had no interest. 
 A letdown.  I've enjoyed Calvin Trillin's writing over the years and looked forward to reading his latest book. Unfortunately, Family Man reminded me of one of those multi-page Christmas letters that we receive,  with a cringe, from our better relatives.  This series of anecdotes comes  across as one long euphemism for family life.  The writing is unrevealing  and self-amused, containing the kind of witty, but shallow, stories you  might expect to hear at a light social gathering.  His wife, Alice, comes  across as a dour, controlling presence; his children are anonymous to the  point of being interchangeable.  I have a tremendous respect for Trillin as  a writer, but this book seemed empty, as if Trillin were unable or  unwilling to really share meaningful revelations about his family life 
 I made the mistake of ordering this tape, thinking it was the Left Behind movie based on the popular Christina books series.  I was wrong.  It's an evangelistic tape is a news format to simulate what news broadcasts might be like after the Rapture.  It's ok, but the production quality leaves a little bit to be desired 
 I can't give her a half a star? Yep, I heard Me'shell for the first time in quite awhile on XM Radio just recently. Her new jazz album is being featured alot lately, which is too bad, because I like Beyond Jazz on XM, but I have to turn to a different channel everytime I hear that dreadful sax player she's got playing with her. If you like "stress-free" jazz, definately stay away from this one. I like Me'Shell from back-in-the-day! 
 Perhaps I didn't get this correctly but this book didn't really live up to my expectations.   I did learn some stuff from it and have used some of it since, but I actually expected a little more from it.   Possibly I was expecting a little too much. If you are after something that will tell you some of the basics of working with flip charts, designs of flip charts and a little bit about the type of hardware then this is a good one.   If you are after something that will help you to create dynamic sessions, push the limits of visual aids, and drive people into more thoughtful training sessions then this book is only partly useful. 
 Avid fans of Sidney Sheldon will probably enjoy this book.  It is indeed as is noted in the editorial reviews a rough-hewn and crudely carved sequel of "The Other Side of Midnight."  Sheldon does not deviate from the routine trashy forumla replete with cliche bedroom scenes and a plethora of ruthless characters.    Set in the late 1940s right after WWII, Catherine, wife of pilot Larry whom readers first encountered in "The Other Side of Midnight" regains her memory.  She remembers how cruel Larry was to her and how he jilted her for his mistress, Noelle Page.  Indeed, Noelle was the kept mistress of one Constantin Demiris who was written to sound like an ersatz Ari Onasis.  Demiris, like a magician can make those in his disfavor disappear.  Exit Larry and Noelle in the first installment.  In this book, Catherine, the long-lost heroine is restored to glory and is swept off her feet by a man who is loosely based on the cliche Cavalry men.    A psychiatrist and an eclectic mix of patients are thrown into this story; just how they are directly tied into the main plot has never been addressed.  One character who is clearly written as an autistic savant displays some of the more prominent autistic behaviors.  He is echolalic; he recites long chains of information and he knows the number and type of vehicles he passes in route to the doctor's office.  His activities are solitary and few; he does not voluntarily interact with others.  I am really tired of stories like this that portray characters with autism as automaton-like savants with isolated abilities that are far removed from the social world.  I think stories like this do a grave disservice to those with autism and for others who come across autistic characters because it is just perpetuating a stereotype.  This book does not really contain much of a mystery.  It's just ruthless people getting even with each other.  Even good old Demiris' wife Melina enters this story after having been relegated to shadow figure status in the original.  Same old fare.  An attorney who was directly involved in a trial engineered by Demiris re-enters the picture.  Some fancy manuevering, and he runs away with the show.  Literally 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 This book has come good information, but too many things are constantly repeated.  There is no flow to the book and when you get interested in the idea of the book, Constance goes off on a tangent that takes you off the beaten path.  I read a number of historical business books out there and have to say that although there is a lot of history about the company, the author did very little to keep your interest.  I would not recommend getting this book 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 This one's going back to the store.  It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat.  If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat.  As for the "massage", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu.  I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet 
 I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.    With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time 
 During her Warner years, Bette Davis constantly lobbied the studio to let her play Mattie in a film of ETHAN FROME.  Jack Warner was sure no one would care to see such hopeless material filmed, no matter how starry or surefooted the treatment.  On the basis of this plodding version, I have to agree with Jack.  American Playhouse's theatrical wing has managed to turn the book every high school student hated (Wharton's novella has done more to kill the idea of reading for pleasure for generations of students than any literary work since SILAS MARNER was thrust upon an unwary world) into a picture that's more grim duty than pleasure.  A game cast struggles to animate Richard Nelson's bare-bones screenplay, but they're soon defeated, lost in an endless progression of drab scenes that sit there, inert, rather than smouldering with emotional subtext, as presumably was intended.  Neeson and Allen come off rather better than Patricia Arquette; very attractive in other films, she seems slackjawed and dimwitted here.  A pleasure to see Katharine Houghton, aging well and in there pitching in a thankless role.  Think of this version as taking about an hour longer than reading the Cliff Notes, and feeling only half as enjoyable, and you'll be in the right ballpark 
 This book comes up well short of containing, "Everything you need to know." It might be OK for someone new to biking in general. For instance, it reviews shifting, braking, and basic bike accessories, such as bike shorts and helmets. In fact, most of the book is a recycled hodge podge of general biking info padded with an unbelievable amount of filler. It contains inane questionaires and advice lists that are kind of amusing, but not really helpful. Is Easy Rider your favorite movie? Than they have the tour for you! Trying to hook up on a bike trip? Than don't ask, "Is that a banana in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?" I kid you not. This book devotes several pages describing how to do a pushup, a pull-up, and a crunch. With all this fluff, there is very little room leftover for any touring specific information, and rarely gets beyond common sense advice (i.e., pack light). A whole chapter vaguely describes 10 dream bike trips (#10 being your own back yard). This chapter could have been so much better. In the end, it seems like very little effort was put into making this a quality book on bike touring. I was profoundly disappointed. Much better, in my opinion, is, "The Essential Touring Cyclist." If you are interested in self-supported touring, "Adventure Cycle-Touring," is probably the best I have seen, and covers camping, specific brands of touring bikes, etc., etc 
 I liked more the Raven Prince plot prelude on each chapter than the whole story. How can a man send some minion to ask his lady to marry him? And then get mad because she said no? The plot has many comments like this. On the other hand, the main plot could be written in overly less pages 
 This book is 80% verbage and 20% needed information. The ratio is similar to that you might get from listening to bloated bureacrat explain federal regulations for the purchase of government pencils.   The worst part about this book is that upon first reading, it actually seems to contain information. You don't realize how much verbage there is until it comes time to take a nursing test.   Don't listen to these other reviewers. Avoid this book at all costs. I've spent hours poring over a single chapter only to find a shorter more compact book that got the info across in ten minutes. 
 This book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the "dummies" series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog.     It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense.     If you have to read a "quick book" find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc 
 I don't know why this is, but when I put on the Dale Sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls 
 I'm really disappointed in this book.  The overall premise was a solid one, that if you can buy (say) a DVD for $12, watch it, then resell it on eBay for $5, it really only costy ou $7.  The author goes into some of the history and theory of secondary markets, why they work, and why they are important.    Unfortunately, I just gave you the whole book.  He repeats the above 3-5 times a chapter for 10 chapters, and weaves in commercials for his own, drop-shipping company, claiming that only fools or hobbyists would consider selling things on eBay themselves.    I wish this book had been worth the time or money it took to read it, as the topic is a fascinating one, but instead I feel like I was duped into reading a barely disguised brochure for the author's company.  I cannot recommend anything about this book 
 it is a real pitty that the amazon editors didn't choose to publish the whole of Bickerton's review -- there we would, for example, see that Bickerton actually hopes "for a sequel" in order to have the book  actually says something one could appreciate.  this title certainly doesn't  do justice to Verdery's otherwise excellent academic record.  it is written  in haste, with a complete lack of attention and needed careful reading of  details.  at the end we get an impression that she is making fun of other  people's misery.  it was obviously a too difficult task for her aims: the  analysis is highly superficial, as if she aspired more to amuse than really  teach.  but dead bodies is something I find difficult to laugh about, no  matter how pathetic the circumstances of their manipulations are 
 I usually buy OXO products because their quality is excellent. This product misses the mark however. The workmanship was shoddy and it broke before it was even installed! The idea behind it is a good one but I bought the ratchet paper towel holder as a replacement and it is the best 
    I recently bought a 1985 Saab 900S and this service manual was given to me with the car. I new the car had a bad starter when I purchased the car, but I figured that it wouldn't be much of a problem. I have replaced many starters on many different vehicles...so no big deal right?...WRONG! I looked for the starter under the front part of the engine, but I couldn't find it. I then looked in the manual, which did not have even 1 picture or diagram of the starter anywhere! Not only that, there was absolutely no mention of its loacation anywhere in the manual or how to remove and replace it. I had to trace out the positive lead from the battery to find it! It then took me approximately 5 hours, just to figure out how to remove the starter and remove it. I had to remove many hoses and assemblies, just to get into position to remove the starter, and even then it was extremely difficult! Yet, there is NOTHING in the manual to guide you through this, not even a lousy picture or diagram. I guess that they must have assumed that its all routine for the novice mechanic. Either that..., or an oversite on their part!? I called several 'saab mechanics', and the 'saab dealership' as well. They all considered this a major job! One mechanic even declined to take on the job! The dealer wanted $975.00 to do the job and also told me that I would be without my car for several days! Lucky for me, I was able to get it done myself somehow.         The next thing to do was to replace any worn or suspicious looking bushings,hoses and belts. I figured that it would be better to do this now, rather then wait for another problem!? This was reinforced in me one evening while driving home. I was almost home when a worn bushing exploded when I downshifted and hit the gas. The location of this bushing affected not just the carberation, but also the power steering! The car wouldn't idle and was extremely difficult to steer, but I made it home. After this, I decided to replace all suspicious looking bushings,hoses and belts. I did this with little trouble on my own, never referring to the manual until I got to the belts. I referred to the manual for the second time for this repair, after being NO help to me with the starter motor! The manual does did have picture this time, but not so fast. There are 4 belts to be changed. There are 2 alternator/waterpump belts, 1 power steering belt and 1 ac compressor belt. The manual tells you to refer to figure # for the ac compressor belt pulley..which is nowhere to be found! There is no figure or illustration for this particular belt! The manual did have diagrams for the other two belt repairs...but not this one! Even though they refer to a diagram that isn't even there! Another oversite I guess...         I have since been able to replace all 4 shocks, replace all 4 rotors and break pads all around and tune up the car (distributor, rotor and plugs), without referring to the manual! I did call upon it twice and was disappointed both times...especially the first! I have owned the car for about 4 months now and came to Amazon.com to find a more complete and user friendly manual. If there isn't one out there...'do it yourselfer's' like myself with equal or lesser automotive knowledge, will find themselves in a pickle 
 Have to agree with the reviewer from Melbourne on this one. Herzog says in the introduction that he eschews any overarching methodology, laudable in theory I suppose but not very good in practice. The result is a rather  meandering narrative that lacks the benefit of a clear central argument to  structure it. Probably the main strength of the book is that it draws on a  staggeringly broad set of texts. [To be fair, I have not read the entire  book, so you can take my criticisms with a grain of salt I suppose, though  I do think I have grasped the essentials of his text. 
 I've been using a model 199 coffee maker for about 2 years. First carafe lasted about a year. Second lasted a little less. I'm just starting on my third carafe. Carafe thermal liner explodes during coffee making leaving a 10-cup mess to clean up. Coffee is good, but carafe only keeps coffee hot a couple hours. By the end of the second hour coffee is closer to luke-warm 
 This is without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.  You need to take notes to understand it.  It is very disjointed; it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form. It deals with a fascinating subject; it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book.  This may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer; she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner 
 Sorry, that's just not possible.  I've read Neal Stephenson's books and he is a very, very good author.  This book is bad.  The story is extemely disjointed.  It jumps all over the place from character to character with no sense that things are coming together.  And things don't come together.  It's a very disappointing book.  Rather reread Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, Zodiac or the Baroque Cycle.  Even The Big U is better than Cobweb 
 This collection of "poems" is embarrassingly bad from beginning to end. Little more than notes, the stuff would not be published if it weren't Snyder. He has done nothing since the Beats, and did very little back then. Why bother publishing him at all 
 The phone has too much static unless you're sitting right next to the console, in which case you might has well have a corded phone 
 This is a typical book based on the European sense of superiority over other cultures. It claims that very heart of Indian religion and philosophy, which is based on the Upanishads, is merely a way to impress  Westerners. However, given the acknowledged fact that these scriptures  predate most of Western civilization by thousands of years, how could they  have been motivated by the need to impress Europeans at that time. In  relatively recent times, Shankara re-popularized the Upanishad philosophy,  giving it the name Vedanta. But that too was in the 7th century, a thousand  years before the arrival of the British in India. It was in reaction to the  Buddhists, particularly the Madhyamikya, that Vednata was polularized  starting in the 7th century. One should read the many Westerners who have  been and continue to be inspired by the Upanishads for many of the ideas  that constitute today's prevalent worldview in the West called  post-modernism. I suggest that its better for a reader to read books by  authors such as Harold Coward, Fritojf Schoun, W. C. Smith, Hustom Smith,  and Bede Griffiths, in order to get a baeetr view 
 Although the book boasts what seems as an interesting approach, it rarely lives up to the idea of cross-breeding geography with studies of the Internet. I found myself lost in endless rants on what can now be assumed to be common wisdom (i.e. explanations and definitions of the www, e-mail, usenet, etc.). Furthermore, I have found a lot of typos, which I find not only sloppy, but simply disgusting given the price of the book. Methodologically the book seems very rich, but it fails to elaborate thorougly on issues. An example of the latter would be the chapter on cyberspace, which quotes many authors being of relevance to the study of cyberspace, but how exactly is not thorougly discussed, it is merely mentioned.   On a more theoretical level, I find the authors' emphasis on spatiality intriguing, but not as relevant as they pose it is. I strongly disagree with their virtual / actual distinction, which can only clutter theoretical discussions on the implications of cyberspace on our lives. I fail to see why people still metaphysically dichotomize the so-called 'real world' with the digital world. Sure, there are differences, but who would disagree networked information technologies have an impact on us?  Just what the future of cartography / geography will be remains extremely shady and mysterious. Sad but true 
 I own two Greg Gorman books, Inside Life and Perspectives both of which feature his celebrity portraits.  They are wonderful collections and his photos of Keanu Reeves and Stephen Dorff remain among the most iconic and appealing ever shot of those two actors.  Truth be told however, I've always found Gorman's nude work on the dull side and much of this comes down to simple stylistic preference.  To generalize, there are two major styles of physique photography, the naturalism of photographers like Nan Goldin, Larry Clark and Bruce Weber that follows in the path of Wilhelm Von Gloeden (1856-1931) and on the other hand the stylized, studio-bound artifice of people like Greg Gorman, Robert Mapplethorpe (even his rougher work) and Herb Ritts that has its origins more in the physique mags of the 1950's.  As I See It falls squarely into the latter of these styles.  Where the naturalistic photographers are happy to explore real interiors and airy outdoor locations (preferably with people engaged in recognizable activities) people like Gorman are interested in re-creating a particular  stylized ideal with studio lighting and studio poses.  The models in this world don't sweat, break out or laugh...just pose.  All that's missing are (to borrow a phrase I once read) beach balls and hula hoops.  Compare this style to Bruce Webers.  While his advertising campaign for Abercrombie and Fitch may be monotonous, his book collections are funny, sexy and memorable.  I can call to mind individual photos from his last book Branded Youth whether the amusing wrestling camp series or the photo of the little birds clawing into the white shoulders of the boy with braces.  As I See It is a world of Tadzio-like models held at arms length by a photographer who is best when exploring what is unique about each of his subjects rather than making them all look interchangeable.    
 I enjoyed "Stoner and Spaz" so when I saw another by the same author, I thought I'd give it a try. "The Brimstone Journals" does have a good premise-that's what made me pick it up. But I felt there were just too many voices involved. Some of the minor characters had two, maybe three poems. That didn't seem enough to fully develop the character. All it did was give you a stereo type. As I was reading, I would just think, "yeah, that's the anorexic, that's the goody-goody..." That's how I was able to keep track of who was who. I thought the "Brimstone Journals" was a good story, but just needed to be longer, the characters more developed, to be truly enjoyed 
 I think its not wise to refer to only one source here is one of the testmonies:  "I was born in Israel (Palestine then) to a well-known Jewish religious family. We are living in Israel for many generations; well before the Zionists infiltrated the Middle East. Jews and Moslems always lived in peace in Palestine until the Zionists came from Europe, massacred the Palestinians (Dir Yassin, etc.) and forced them to run away from their lands and get locked into the refugee camps across the borders for almost three generations.   Studying in a Jewish religious school in Tel Aviv, I was taught that the 'bad Arabs' conducted pogroms all over Palestine killing Jews. My family told me the opposite: we lived in Palestine in peace for generations with our Moslem brothers. When the Zionists started their pogroms (Dir Yassin), the Moslem acted in revenge and started their own pogroms, killing Jews. However, our Moslem friends actually saved the lives of our family by hiding us in their own houses at a risk to their own lives. " http://www.rense.com/general54/thank.htm  you can make your search with many of the Anti-Zionism Jewish organization all over the world. 
 After reading "The Devil Went Down to Austin" I was excited to discover Rick Riordan.  Good writing and well-drawn characters.  Cold Springs was a huge disappointment. The characters were neither very believeable nor were they likeable. Chadwick just didn't ring true and the daughters? -- tell me again why copying Katherine's addictive behavior was so compelling to Mallory? The story was a muddle. 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 i bought it. didn't work. exchanged it. the new one didn't work. same problem--the pump is very weak and just barely seaps out a few drops of liquid soap...that's all. and yes, it does very easily rust.  spend the extra $5 and get something better 
 As a long-time of fan I was disgusted by both the movie and the book. Jordan tries his hand here but comes way short of the previous books. He should just stick to WOT 
 He has no real talent at all. He cannot rap, he has no flow, no lyrics, the beats can make you fall asleep. In short, this is the reason why rap music is so bad nowadays 
 Regardless of the content of the book,  which might be well worth the purchase,  please note that Rashid N. Khan is founder and CEO of Ultimus  apparently a player in the BPM field.  Now the prior reviewer either didn't know that or perhaps found this irrelevant.  If the CEO of Ford professed to identify all the best in class for SUV's  you might anticipate he would be pointing out features found in his own product line even if sub-consciously, because if he believes in what he says.. he builds them that way.  (...)  His book may well provide his target market with information, I just choose to read from a disinterested 3rd party for this information.  "BPM the Third Wave" is a bit higher level look at BPM but they have no products to offer 
 While this book is a memoir of a woman leaving the parish ministry, it does not seem as she has left "church", if by that she means the Episcopal Church. When I completed the book, I felt as if she had been describing a time in my own life (and I am not a priest) when I was overworked, pushing myself too hard and not having time to think. A contemplative, which I take Ms. Talyor to be, needs space and time alone. This book could be about any perons who does not seize the time for quiet in whatever occupation 
 By all means, do as others here have suggested.  Wait until the Criterion Collection version coming January 10, 2006.  For the hard-of-hearing:  WAIT FOR THE CRITERION COLLECTION VERSION!  Thanks for listening 
 We brought this book along with two others to the island.  This book and very little insider information and did not provide details on how to access and find hidden beaches.  Bring the Ultimate Guidebook to Kauai instead and that book will be your constant travel buddy.  I am actually leaving this book behind!  Save your money 
 Movies For The Blind is one of the top ten best hip-hop records ever made. In Stoney Lodge is perhaps one of the most empowering/gut wrenching songs about bipolar disorder ever recorded. Agent Orange, while not new for the disk, is an excellent use of A Clockwork Orange imagery. The list goes on and on. So why then did this album fall flat? On one hand Def Jux is warping him to fit there new "politically conscious" label image and turning him into an Eminem knock off (which is ridiculous because Eminem bit cage's style hard) just listen to peeranoia, and on the other Cage is not the angry twenty something he once was. Cage is now on the thirty year old patient who wants to get sober, and get his life straight. In that sense the album works, it is pretty honest at times. Yet I feel that this somewhat contradicts what happened with Movies. He makes the apology, "everything I said on Movies because of my buzz." This hurts his credibility as an artist. And a line like "this time around I'm just one of you fu8king depressed kids." who is he, Slug? I don't feel the album lived up to the impossible standards set by Movies, yet I am interested to see where he takes this new angle. Overall, it's worth a look, but nothing special 
 Actually, I listened to an unabridged audio book, and I thought it was the most painfully slow book I have ever read in my life. It was fairly well-written, but I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Finally, it did, and the book was still crawling along. I really wasted my money on this one, and the only reason it got two stars rather than one is that it was well-written - but it surely could have used some pacing and plot 
 I've owned this for about two years now. I don't drive, but I still have the same "navigational issues" that everyone else has. I just wanted a convenient electronic replacement for a bulky paper map and magnetic compass.  The 76s isn't the most sensitive GPS I've used by a longshot, and it frequently loses lock in areas with tall buildings. It also takes a long time to get initially locked up (2-3 minutes). This can be very frustrating at times, because I keep having to find large open areas and that can be tough in a downtown area...  My biggest gripe is that it's painfully slow. Entering addresses and street names takes forever; while the lack of a real keyboard doesn't help, and using maps for a dense urban area (SF Bay area) is a contributing factor, the overall slowness of the unit is as least as much to blame. Screen redraws are excruciatingly slow as well; in some cases it can take up to ten seconds to completely redraw. Sometimes it's faster to just get out an old-fashioned paper map instead of trying to struggle with this receiver.  The user interface is awkward, and despite having used it for two years I still have trouble remembering how to do certain things such as creating new named waypoints. The unit uses multiple nested sets of menus and modes, and it can be a challenge keeping track of which modes do what.  The magnetic compass is inaccurate. Each time I use the unit I have to recalibrate it, and even then it seems as if it slowly drifts during use.  It seems to use battery power even when it's turned off. I just plan on replacing the batteries (I use rechargeables) each time I want to use it.  Maybe it's OK for rural use, I can't say. But I'd never recommend this one for use in an urban area; you're much better off getting a paper map instead. Fortunately there are faster units on the market, though I'm surprised at how high the price still is on this one 
 This is the type of book that I have interest in reading but this one in particular was really bad. Trying to establish a connection between the order and Germany is all that this book tries to do. It has some reprinted documents that are very boring to read and its memorandum format kills the interest of any reader. Maybe the only memorandum that is worth reading is the one that talks about education. I wanted to find out more about the media control, banks, etc. and there's nothing. The true meaning of this order remains a mistery. Complete waste of money 
 In follow up to my skeptical, first review of Mr Peterson's "Gray Doom", I researched the total population numbers. Here are the facts. According to the US Census Bureau, in 1999 the median age is 35.5 and the  mean age is 36.4.  In 2030, when the "Peterson crisis" hits, the  median age will be 38.5 and the mean age will be 39.9.  Yes, our total  population will be older but I have a hard time getting too alarmed over 3  years.  In fact, if wisdom comes with age, maybe our "older"  society will be better.  I think Mr. Peterson should present all the facts  and stop trying to alarm us needlessly.  By the way, is he a Democrat 
 Im not even going to argue if they sold out or not (they did in my opinion) but either way, sell out or not these guys have lost their touch. which is a tragedy. I always thought that metallica has always been overrated and overhyped, but I still feel the early 80's metallica did do a great deal for the metal/thrash scene and they were a great band at one time, that i will never deny. however, their new albums, starting with load (alot of people say the demise happened with the black album. while i agree in the fact that it was the beginning of the end, i still think that it was good enough to hold the metallica name. master of puppets it wasn't but load and reload it wasnt either)they have just been on a steady decline, culmonating in this pile of rancid fecal trapped in a plastic dish.   there are several points i want to make on why this album is what i say it is.  vocals: james hetfield either wasn't trying or he just lost his voice due to old age. he should get with bruce dickinson or ronnie james dio, maybe they could give him some pointers on how to maintain his vocal chords.   lyrics: Im madly in anger with you? possibly the dumbest line ever, unless tarzan is your main demographic. thats only a small example.  drums: What in the &%&$ is up with the drums? did someone steal lars' kit, and replace them with african steal drums? good lord that alone is enough to loose 2 stars from the rating. totally annoying, grating and distracting. i can't even concentrate on the rest of the music because that incesant banging drowns everything else out.  Guitars: hetfield and hemmit are decent guitar players, but not one of the elites. and the fact that there are no solos on this album is also disappointing, but even with killer solos this album would already be lost.  production: bob rock needs to be fired, or have a good talking to, cause he really should have realised long ago something wasnt right about this. either that or james and gang need to grow a pair and tell bob whats up.  overall effort: dear metallica. you were once a great band. im not going to say its all over for you, i truly believe you have enough talent as a whole to come back from this horrible slump you find yourself. but you guys need to wake up, take a long look in the mirror and find the real metal heads that are buried deep in your hearts that you guys apparently hid away in the early 90's. become the hungry and angry men that wanted to kick our A**s. either do that or just retire, cause one, none of your fans like seeing you tarnish your already shaky reputation, and honestly, sometimes you need to know when to quit and cut your losses.  ps. i am hearing they are coming out with a new album and they are supposedly going back to their old sound a la master of puppets days. good news, although don't get overjoyed just yet, remember they said that about this album too...<cries 
 The book was a copy of the textbook. The print quality is so bad it looks like the words are disappearing in front of your eyes. 
 Janet Evanovich is my absolute all time favorite author, which is why I'm heartbroken over this book. I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it.   The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick.   I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth.  
 I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the "forgive at all costs" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a ministe 
 I got this book thinking I was going to learn java.  Great right?  Well not, I soon figured out this book is about using someone elses applet, on the web!  First of all This book has nothing to do with programming!  Second of all, If you wanted to have applets on your web-site, why can't you learn to make your own, instead copying off of someone else 
 Whatever Prince had 15-20 years ago, it's gone. In his earlier work, everything seem to have a reason. In this "effort," virtually nothing did. Yes, he did make a few signature Prince "noises," but otherwise I wouldn't have known it was Mr. Purple at all. "Lookit me. I'm Prince. I can make Prince noises, see?" Yes, it could be partially that the DVD sound quality sucked; however, looking out over the audience, I saw far less inspired dancing than I saw at a Devo concert in 1983. So it could be that the DVD sucked simply because the concert sucked. Prince is supposed to inspire me. I should want to dance. Or I should want to jam on the piano. But what did I do when the DVD was done? I went over to the computer and surfed onto the Yahoo financial page. Maybe find something interesting.   My recommendation: get a copy of Purple Rain, watch it twice, and skip the Aladin completely. 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 The notion of "interpretive communities" is at best derivative of Kuhn's classical work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony 
 Even though this is a receiver hitch mount item, it does not use a standard hitch pin.  It is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch (must be bolted into the hitch - to remove, must be unbolted).  This totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch - versatility: the ability to easily - without tools - change whatever is mounted in the hitch.  Bad Thule!  Bad 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 This thing looks like a student got a copy of the original off eBay, scanned it in and printed it at Kinkos. Cheesy and close to illegible in parts. This seems to be the new NatLampCo mode of operation. Grave rob their own material and release poor quality reissues. Very sad, too bad. Echoes of the great read it was, but kind of like digging up Marilyn's corpse for a shag 
 Solo para aclarar.  Sera imbecil el ke pide luces por esta fuente xq' de fabrica no las trae asi ke esperemos ke ese tipo de comentarios no se repitan, para esa gracia mejor se buska otro tipo de fuente mas colorida.  Salu2.. 
 I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.  Alvaro Sacramento, CA 
 I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.      A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio? 
 This book is very tough for someone just starting Electrical Engineering to understand.  The book reqires a lot of previous subject matter knowledge that can be very frustrating if you don't have it.  The mathematical derivations of the equations are somewhat choppy and skip many steps.  Also, the problems at the end of each chapter are extremely difficult compared to what was taught in each chapter 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 Based on the title, I expected this to be an account of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.  There is certainly some of that.  But it's really a book about the author/war correspondent.  The book reiterates countless times how the author was the first American into Nagasaki after the bomb.  That's impressive (although later in the book we read about someone who got to Hiroshima earlier)-- but the book doesn't contain much substance about Nagasaki.  The rest of the book is a mish-mash of other aspects of the war, and it gets repetitive about how merciless the Japanese were to our prisoners.  Toward the end the book tries to become political and focus on censorship, which wasn't very interesting 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 I bought this book when I was locked into a 1-year lease with a roommate that was driving me nuts.  So nuts that I didn't speak to her for a month at one point.  Unfortunately, this book left me unsatisfied.  Later, I found two books that changed my outlook on different types of people and my interactions with them.  The first was "Please Understand Me II:  Temperament, Character, Intelligence" by David Keirsey.  It is an introduction to personality type by the man that took Carl Jung's ideas on the subject and developed them much further.  Filling out the book's questionnaire and reading about my own personality type was like having my life story told by someone that knew me better than my best friend or sibling.  Identifying the personality types of others I knew was incredibly revealing, as well.  The second book, a natural companion to "Please Understand Me II," is "Survival Games Personalities Play" by Eve Delunas.  This book reveales the dark flip side of people's personalities.  At some point you've probably said about someone you know that "He wasn't himself," or "She wasn't herself."  Eve Delunas' book describes the shadow self we and others inhabit when stressed in one way or another, and how to deal with those of each distinctive personality type in their own way.  If these books only helps you to understand why that jerk you know is driving you crazy, it will be well worth the purchase price.     I couldn't recommend these two books more highly.  I'd recommend reading them both, since they each cover subjects that the other does not 
 This book has all the right things to make it a good novel. So why does The Raven only give it a measly two stars? Three words: Excessive language use. A character like John Constantine can be expected to use colorful language. Not a problem. In the real world, people express themselves in any number of colorful or off-color ways. But when the writer begins to add the words as part of the text, not conversation, I begin to wonder about the author's imagination. Isn't there a better way to say that without resorting to "gutter language?" The Raven thinks so. It is unrealistic to think that characters should not give way to full expression, it makes the character more human; you think: "Yeah, I know a bloke like that! Sounds just like him!" But in the context of the writing, it becomes: "Can't he think of another word? I'm tired of reading the f-word all the time!" Quoth the Raven.... 
 I was highly disappointed with this audiobook. I had been expecting it to open up a personal insight into the author's experiences that others could perhaps relate to and help them cope with tragic personal loss. Instead it was chock full of copious detail about irrelevant and meandering topics that showcase Ms. Didions outstanding literary research capabilities, travel and life experiences, but deny the listener an insight into her real feelings and experiences.   I kept listening hoping to warm to the author (I was trying very, very hard to do so let me tell you) and empathize with her experiences but she kept the reader very firmly at arms distance in their place from start to finish. This audiobook is full of so many facts and figures (all in a  minutia of detail) that is reminiscent of a writer who is a talented Googleer and research technician, but who can't relate to real people in a down to earth manner.    The end product is a meticulously detailed and clinical exposition that has the warmth of a bag of ice.  
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 This Book was much less than I'd hoped for.  It really didn't give many ideas for someone already in the beginning of the planning stages, and the theme ideas were pretty limited and not very creative. 
 Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 this is one of the worst books i've ever bought. if you have ever read Fangoria magazine you would have gotten better pictures and more information on mr. carpenter. how can a book like this not go into detail about carpenters famous movie scores! the book is not complete for they don't even mention the made for tv movie ELVIS he made with kurt russell.better information could be obtained from dvd production notes.somebody please write a fitting tribute to a great director 
 Randall may have uncovered just about every fact there is about Thomas Jefferson.  The fact that he dedicated pages evenly to each one is where this book fails.  Thomas Jefferson could be the most complex figure in American history, but most people won't realize that fact from reading this biography because their minds will be numb from reading the first 300 pages of the book dedicated to his early law career that really played little role in the development of Jefferson.  The author tries to justify his inclusion of all this material by theorizing that his contempt for the law system turned Jefferson's mind towards changing the system and thus revolution, and once committed to revolution his ideas on government were influenced by his law teachings, but dedicating 50 pages to Jefferson part in exploting a loop hole in Virinia law to help the First Families acquire more land serves more to make the reader flip through the pages scanning for interesting dates to resume reading.  The real dissapointment in the book is that in spite of all this research, Randall fails to really tackle Jefferson's hypocricies and puzzling political movements.  Perhaps he was unable to find good cause for Jefferson's motives, but to ignore his obvious faults makes this biography toothless.  His borderline treasonous behavior as both Washington's Secretary of State and Adams' Vice-President, his obvious hypocrisy between champion of human equality and slaveowner, and his change of heart about the institution between his authorship of the Declaration and his ascension to the Presidency (along with the glossing over of his decision-making process during the Louisiana Purchase), are all controversial actions of a man usually considered "great" without much examination.  This book would be the proper forum to defend the actions, explain the rationale behind them, or if failing to discover one, call out Jefferson for these personal blemishes.  Randall does none of this, either lamely glossing over the points or omitting them altogether.  After becoming president, the story gets so thin that it makes one wonder if Randall himself got bored with his research and writing of Jefferson's early career that he simply wanted to finish the book.  He chose the wrong part of Jefferson's life to cut from.  The book gets 2 stars for the information it contained, and doesn't get 3 more because of its presentation and lack of the information that it should have.  There must be more engaging biographies of Jefferson than this one 
 After all the Hype about this game I bought it...well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face. The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring. There are other RPGs out there that are better and you simply get immersed in the story line quickly. The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over. The "costumes" and "decals" are kinda stupid. Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND, well is NOT and not even close. The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics, sound , game play and fun. dont get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either. check out some reviews out there before you buy it 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 I've owned both editions and I totally agree with previous reviewers about preferring the original version. The older version analyzes one book ("The Accidental Tourist") that is easy to get new or used, and won't eat too significantly into time you should be writing instead of reading. The newer version analyzes several books which starts to look more like a book on literary criticism rather than on the writing process. The original is much more process-oriented, since the goal of the reader of this specific book is to get words on the page, not just broaden the amount of novels on the shelf.   Overall, I was disappointed. I thought the newer version was long-winded with lots of unnecessary filler that hindered more than helped. Get the original. It's worth it 
 As a Clark Sister Groupie, I think the comment made by another viewer is correct, as good as her hair and make up is, her songs should match. I also own all of her Karen Clark's CD's.  This one is an acquired style CD.  If you like Israel Houghton and his production as well as slow praise and worship..this CD is for you.  If you enjoyed "The Heaven's are Telling" and "Finally: Karen" more, then you probably won't like this CD. It depends on what your expectations were.  I bought this CD because once again, she took a beautiful picture.  I'm 26 y/o so I like more up-tempo songs and bass-heavy ballads.  This cd doesn't offer much up-tempo and she took some production risks with Israel and her own son.  I am so pleased with Karen for trying new things and allowing her own son to produce and be a part of the family business, D+ for pleasing an old fan and having this cd end up on my shelf.  
 What a waste of time and money. 10 songs and hardly 20-30 minutes... of pure mediocrity.   Weezer is an amazing band...just don't bother on this one folks. Pinkerton and the Blue album are just classics. I Respect those guys a whole lot.  This is just...disappointing to say the least. It's just BAD, even for a Weezer fan. Lately Weezer has been trying to do with their nerd-rock label and are going for an almost loveable, adorable sort cutesy label.  I can't make myself clear enough. Don't go near this album, it's just the bottom of the corporate barrel. 
 When you find yourself double-checking the bookjacket to see if the author you have enjoyed in the past could really have written this, it is not a good sign.  I can't even get into the book. I have read Catherine Coulter before, and while she isn't my favorite romance novelist, I have had only enjoyable experiences thus far.  That ended when I picked up this book from the library.   The dialogue is awful. There is no flow, they just randomly say things out of their mouths. There is no context for it either, no reason given for anything they say. And since what they say is so unbelievably corny, trite, or odd, you really need some kind of frame to put it in for it to have any meaning. I gather from the reviews that this contains characters from her other books, so maybe the context is there.  The whole conversation about discipline in the beginning pages also has no context. I found myself trying to picture this and trying to figure out what in the heck she really meant by discipline. Did it mean what I think it meant? Or something else? It wasn't super clear.  The man's character gives you nothing to work with. He's a womanizer and yet, he spills out a story about avenging his housemaid's demise.  Then he immediately blurts out "Why did I say that?" Why indeed? When he is questioning it, I know I'm in trouble.    And what is up with the whole "big girl" repetition? First, a big girl in my mind is someone with larger proportions--not necessarily someone tall. The "big girl" is gorgeous, but we have no idea why because the descriptions he pants about her don't describe anything. Just picture a goddess. There ya go. Got it?  Good.    Unfortunately I'm not going to make it to the whole "point" of this book, something about a treasure. I cannot, simply cannot get past these pages.  
 The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing : 
 Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
 I don't even want to remember how big of a disappointment this disc was when I got it the same day it came out. Let's a have a brief "memory re-capping" before going into the details of Crush.   1992 - Bon Jovi releases the highly critical Keep the Faith album. The album is a great come-back disc since Sambora and Jon Bon Jovi overcome their egos and agree to put out great rock album. It rules just like their 80's catalog. Success is achieved again.  1994 - The first ever best of collection titled Crossroad comes out featuring new power ballad "Always" which rocks hard and gives them tons of airplay. However, this is just the beginning of their downfall, releasing a million other compilation discs, and re-re-re-recorded live albums in the next ten coming years!  1995 - With the grunge scene hitting hard and dominating the charts, Jon Bon Jovi and Sambora join forces and agree that the best way to face the Nirvana/Pearl Jam trend is to release an all-love-song dominated disc (save for the title track). And it works, to a certain extent at least. These Days proves to be a satisfying record overall, but both the fans and particularly Jon Bon Jovi himself realise that their musical direction isn't going to take them anywhere far anymore. They've run out of interesting ideas and the motives to compose honest, sincere rock tunes, so they capitalize on ballads. In the meantime, Jon focuses on taking cheap shots at horrible movies displaying his embarrassing talents as an "actor". Sambora releases his sophomore album which, in comparison to Stranger in This Town, flops, and Jon does the Destination Anywhere "pop" record, which also fails miserably.  So with the grunge scene receding, they release, Crush, their first album in the last five years. The result is a poorly written, pop-flavoured, weak record with little to no emphasis on Sambora's guitar playing (not that Sambora cares anyway) and bringing their newly found 'image' to the fore. The album features their new 'looks' in more than ten pics. What's worse is, you open the booklet inside the CD case only to find more 'artsy' pics, mostly of Jon, and his 'gang'. No lyrics (cause Jon knows better than all of us that he can't even pen love songs anymore), no liner notes, no nothing. It's horrible packaging. Sadly, the music, while getting them under the spotlight with the POP anthem "It's My Life" (anyone who thinks this is a rock tune is an idiot!), isn't any better either. Even the "Thank You for Loving Me" ballad has no lasting effect as the band's previous ballads, i.e. "Always", "In These Arms", "Bed of Roses". Point being, Crush is just a lame attempt on their part to cash in on it when they can, just before another grunge/nu-metal scene comes and blows them away. The music presented on this disc contains no hooks let alone rocking guitar melodies, no catchy or hummable vocal harmonies as the band's previous works, no lyrics that need to be read (hence they are left out of the booklet), no powerful drumming by Tico. It's just a pop-oriented record using guitars to look cool. The songs are shorter, less structured, and have no momentum. Therefore, no matter how hard Bon Jovi, Sambora, Torres, Bryan or McDonald try, it's all in vain. These Days was the nail in their coffin. Bon Jovi post-1995 sucks. I truly feel sorry for all those teenagers who fell in love with this band upon seeing the video of "It's My Life" and picking up their entire back catalog on a whim. They think they are fans, when in fact they're just trend-followers of a trend-hopping sell-out band 
 I can't stand to look too close when Anna's cousin is on the show...you have to see her to believe it! It scares me to think people like this roam the earth...This episode wasn't that funny more annoying because you just want to run screaming after seeing this *thing* on the screen. I won't spoil the episode but cousin Shelly is the biggest hick thing to hit TV....scary 
 i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but.... some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however 
 Historically inaccurate, as has been mentioned before.  Before you see the movie search online for Artemisia's work.  If the director, in her movie had shown the very powerful piece "Susannah and the Elders" her theory of Artemisia's romance with Tassi would have been ripped to shreds.  Only a woman suffering from circumstance and a cruel injustice could've depicted scenes with such passion.  In the painting Susannah's face and posture show such despair and hopelessness.  Also, Judith and Holofernes (sp?), it doesn't take a genius to see the violence there.  For Heaven's sake, she's sawing his head off, no quick slice there!  Judith's face is one of grim determination.  Plus only a female director who submits passively to domestic abuse and lacks self esteem or vision can make a rape into a gentle love affair(yes, I am saying I think the director needs counseling).  Plus the movie never mentions the fact that Tassi attempted to have his wife killed on five different occasions.  See this great woman's work, don't buy the movie 
 This is supposed to be a classic, highly recommened to me by a literate friend. I agree that it is poetic, and has a gossimer feel to it.  But, I found it a tedious read. It is in that somewhat detatched present tense that I do not relate well to. The story line is difficult to follow, the character hard to understand. I will not read any more of Ondaatje, I imagine 
 book is way too simplistic. good concept, but could have been written in one chapter 
 For decades feminist authors such as Miss Daly have used their dubious credentials in academia to promulgate the fantasy of a golden age before the onset of "patriarchy," It's the same 60s nonsense-strip away the fancy prose and you're left with the following executive summary: Women once ruled the earth with flowy robes and Gaia conjuring magic wands, and all the world worshipped the Goddess. Any woman who has the courage to study the historical,archeological and paleological evidence by academics with ACTUAL ACCREDITED Ph.D.s will soon understand that this gynocentric vision is a myth.  The effect of this genre of novel is not to increase grace, love and mercy, but to further splinter humanity into yet more little tribes, all petulantly vying for victim-status and privilege.  When we sublimate and externalize our spiritual pain and longing for God to a hatred of other groups (in this case, men) how can we find peace, happiness and  love in our journey through life?   Read books that open your heart. The best antidote to Miss Daly's agenda-of-rage is Cynthia Eller's  "The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory : Why An Invented Past Will Not Give Women a Future." Cynthia Eller easily exposes the Gaia/Sophia/Lilith movement as a scam, and helps the reader differentiate between the two major concepts of Truth: an external, objective and verifiable reality, vs. subjective concept groupings used to stabilize a fragmented secular consciousness. Another valuable read is "Interior Castle" or "The Way of Perfection" by St. Teresa of Avila. I challenge any woman to read those 2 books and conclude that the author was "marginalized" and repressed by the "patriarchy." More likely, they would understand that a loving apprehension of woman's beauty, power and regnancy existed centuries before the word "feminism" was ever breathed on a western campus. The great irony is that this vision of women, infinitely larger, more beautiful and complex than anything modern feminism has ever proposed, is the very reality which Miss Daly desperately wishes to extinguish in her disciples. In 50 years, the present farrago of theoreticians- Andrea Dworkin, Germaine Greer, Naomi Wolf, Susan Faludi ad infinitum will all be dead and forgotten, their books mouldering in bargain bins and used book stores. Don't follow their fate, sisters... only love is stronger than death, and you will find love in the men and women of the past centuries who knew God intimately 
 This is a fast moving political thriller with a good plot.  Thecharacters are somewhat two dimensional, but, all in all, not bad.What ruined it for me was the horrible editing.  Maybe it wasn't edited at all, though, because I counted at least 10 errors in grammar, punctuation and fact in the first 100 pages.  The book was evidently self published, because an Amazon quote from the publisher gives her name as the person to whom the author dedicates the book, his "life partner".  I do not object to self publishing, but I do object to the distracting and extremely unprofessional product and feel cheated at having spent money on this level of writing.  EN 
 I have a few concerns with the words Willie Jolley writes and speaks.  Never quote the bible then talk about going out and doing all you can to make more money. Do you really believe Jesus condones the desire to gain "worldly" things Willie? You talked the entire time about your riches and have the nerve to quote proverbs...   I have a little tip for you Willie, when you write or speak, don't use Microsoft  / Bill Gates as examples of success. You do know that they were found guilty in a court of law numerous times of illegal practices to get where they are right? They lie, steal, and cheat to get ahead.  Will you be endorsing Martha Stewart and Enron next? Maybe use Tyco or Halliburton as an example of how to succeed and make loads of money.  I have a little tip for you too Willie, maybe a little something you can throw in your speeches or possibly your next book: Tell the people you talk to, that no matter how much money they get, that in life, happiness is what really counts. Just, do something everyday that makes you smile. You don't have to brainwash yourself by repeating affirmations of "I am happy" 800 times a day. You don't have to force yourself to be a type-a personality. You don't have to climb the corporate ladder of achievement to have a wonderful fulfilling life. No Willie, all you need is to accept you for who you are, and strive to be happy. I smile everyday. I don't have to brainwash myself to get there.  You're either the bee or the windshield? Too bad life isn't so black and white as to only be reduced to such.  I say, seek out the fields of flowers and avoid the highway altogether.  
 One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.   The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the "flip it" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the "dirty water" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer.   On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day 
 Basically that is what I was asking myself through the entire book. What is going ON? I dunno, something abt a typhoon and these two gay guys on a ship I think ... Conrad needed a therapist. I think he was confused 
 I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad poetry from a twisted man 
 Okay.  If you're a historian, you might enjoy this book.  If you're not, beware!  This book is so incredibly dry and flavorless.  I was astounded, I mean, how can you make a book about the Renaissance BORING?  I guess it's possible.  Wilcox gives you a lot of information and it's organized very nicely, but still, this book has no soul.  It's just......dull 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 I purchased this as a book on CD and it was horribly dull.  I kept waiting for something "meaty" but the characters were completely flat.  The voices on the Audio book were horrible and the Marilyn Monroe voice of the car was completely far fetched.  It never came together as a book and I was so glad when it was over.  This was the first Janet Evanovich book I read(listened to) and I am not willing to waste more of my time with future novels 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 This "documentary" has the look and feel of THIS IS SPINAL TAP: the situations are absurd and the characters are ridiculous but there's a harsh feeling of reality to the proceedings.  The comedy here is the nonstop beating of these preening, arrogant "air personalities" who try to hold their lofty perches up while getting hit with horrendous business practices, battering reality checks ("John Kerry can still win this!"), and abyssmal ratings--all while sniping at who's getting better PR and bickering with their audience or co-workers or even their own family members. I don't even know if the blokes from Spinal Tap would've soldiered on this long!  But leave it to HBO to put a "happy ending" on this othewise fascinating documentary.  That even made me laugh outloud: after seeing the complete chaos of how Air America came into being, HBO shows a graphic of the USA and insinuates that the radio network is springing up all over the map and firmly taking root.  I just read today that Air America's shares have fallen dramatically (Randi Rhodes is 25th in New York City) and I know they've been replaced by a Mexican mariachi station where I am in the West. Was HBO's final graphic to this "documentary" meant to be part of the joke 
 I bought this based on the two previous reviews which are dead wrong.  There is nothing orginal about this album.  It is still just manufacturered idol crap.  I will give 'just will' the benifit that he has a strong voice but this album is not worth buying unless you want idol drival 
 The best I can say about this book is that the author seems to mean well and writes with a light, fun style.  If you're a VERY brand new Mac user AND if you're intimidated by more advanced technical information, this book may be for you.  Otherwise, save your money and you'll get better info from the various 'help' screeens on the Mac itself 
 We couldn't find ANY of the collectibles on which we needed information - and the index was the WORST I've ever seen!  I felt totally ripped off with this book but it would cost more to return than it was worth.  Maybe I can find an antique outhouse and supply it with a fresh 2007 price guide... 
 This book does not present any new information. Several books, notably Duncan's "The Dollar Crisis" does a much better job of explaining the fundamental dangers of a managed currency. This book adds smugness and some barely comprehensible jibes at the current American system for not being libertarian enough, but throughout the book there is barely a suggestion of a practical solution for any of the problems it describes. Duncan provides some pie in the sky solutions, (a global minimum wage), but at least he says something.  Wiggins' final advice is to buy gold. Hope I didn't spoil it for ya. The reason why you should amounts to, "because it was good enough for ancient Rome". There is VERY much repetition of the basic points, and many of the anecdotes don't support the point he makes in the same chapter. The entire chapter on John Law could have been explained in a sentence, and then he could have taken some time to tell us what we could do to avoid the temptation to inflate the currency! This is supposed to be a book about the coming of the reckoning day, but other than a timid assertion that the current bear market could last as long as 18 years, we don't even get a hint of what factors would have to combine to create the catastrophic financial conditions that the book's title seems to presuppose.  All in all worthless. Read Duncan 
 I returned the book because after I paid for it, I found something in the information that I hadn't been able to see beforehand in the listing, and it said that the book was paperback.  We did not want paperback, and also had someone contact us who'd had this course before at the school where the class is, and we bought a used hardback Algebra 2 book from them for less than half what we had paid for this one.  The course itself is pretty good 
 Nobody would seriously question Kagan's abilities to translate this important text, but there are other translations that are less odiously biased. Donald Kagan is a co-signor of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC--their manifesto @ newamericancentury.org), an organization headed by William Kristol and populated by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Libby, and other Bush family associates who are the individuals most responsible for the post 9/11/01 catastrophic misguiding of American foreign policy. Kagan, as many before, has appropriated Thucydides' great book for political purposes, made plain in a NYT Op-ed, in co-authored work with V.D. Hanson (a Cheney mentor), and most plainly, on the PNAC website. Kagan has used his considerable talent to turn Thucydides' morality tale of the first great democracy's fall from grace into greed and ruin into support for an unapologetic, overt and cruel imperialist policy, both then and now. As Daniel Mendelsohn put it in the New Yorker magazine in Jan. 2004, Kagan gives us the Peloponnesian War as Ollie North may have described it. Thus his translation might constitute an integral part of a study in intellectual neo-fascism and corruption, but certainly not as the authoritative treatment presented to undergraduates.  Bottom line: readers interested in Thucydides' own view of empire should read another translation. More importantly, readers, students, and citizens who question what the current administration has done to our democracy might also want to consider what passes for wisdom in some halls at Yale University 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 Now that should be the title of this book people. D. Pipes writes a book condemning anything that is critical of the official version of events. To him no matter how much evidence exist the official proclammation is always right. That aside there is another subject that this book dodges. Some of the most insane conspiracy theorys actually come from Pipes and his neocon minions. This is a example of a conspiracy theory that Pipes believes in. He alledges an Islamist conspiracy to take over or destroy the United States. According to Pipes one of the focal points for this conspiracy is the Commitee for American Islamic Relations(CAIR),which he thinks wants to impose Islamic law on this country LOL. So Pipes thinks that the US might be the next Afghanistan. Now that we all know what kind of silly theories that this intellectual midget conjures up how can we believe anything he says. Another theory of his is that all conspiracy theorys are racist at there core. Now I agree that a fraction of the so called conspiracy theorist are nothing more than racist and bigots. What this book doesnt tell you is that Pipes is on record with many racist idea's himself. Behind the self rightous intellectual snobbery of Pipe's book is his hatred for the Islamic world. He is on record stating that the only hope of peace in the middle east is a total Israely victory and a Palestinian defeat. Now to us rational people who are not in the business of the military industrial complex we know that would create more war, more hatred, more terror. Not to mention the unnesacary suffering of Mulsim, Jewish, and European people. So yes the neocon moron Pipes is a "Conspiracy Theorist". I am not a conspiracy theorist on the other hand. I am a skeptic. I am skeptical of official conspiracys that are hell bent on conquest, and the slaughter of our countries own citezens in the quest for OIL and World Government. A conspiracy that has 19 incompitant thugs fooling our entire intelligence and defence network. The Mastermind of this conspiracy is a old saudi millionaire in a cave with a laptop on a kidny dialysis machine. The mastermind is reputed of being of "simple intellect". He also has been funded by a rogue network in our Intelligence community since the eighties. Despite being on the worlds most wanted list he has been protected from capture by prominant officials in our so called government. On many occasions before 9-11 such as Sudan, and his hospitalization in a american military hospital in dubai during mid 2001 he has been protected. Not too mention the fact that he is residing safe in Pakistan as you read this. Come on if he was of no use to our Neocon tyrants we would just illegaly invade Pakistan like Iraq. In this case when the so called mastermind is residing in saftey our govt decides to respect Pakistans sovereignty by not crossing there border. While this is happening our borders our being swarmed by millions of people. Instead of making sure no "terrorist" are coming over to our country our govt has decided to spy on you and me. And mostly the official conspiracy says that jet fuel has brought down for the first time in modern history not 1, not 2, but 3 modern steel sky skrapers( WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC building 7 which was not even touched by a plane or falling debris. Ironicaly on PBS's Rebuilding America special Larry Silverstein the lease holder of the world trade center complex addmited that building 7 was pulled. That is the slang for demolishing a building in the world of controlled demolitions.) Anyways dont listen to me or Pipes. Investigate for yourself and use your own head. 
 Being asian myself I am highly insulted by this book! To think there is some mystical book that tells people how they date asians is totaly foolish. Guys, asians are girls just like any other girls and they like the same things. Instead of throwing away your money on this cowpie of a book, buy the girl some flowers. They will go a lot further at winning her heart than anything you will learn from this book 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 On the plus side, this book is fairly easy to understand and contains sufficient pictures of the exercises.  I was very excited at first, but unfortunately none of the exercises, massages, meditations, etc I tried seemed to help any of my health problems, even after a month.  The book contains inspiring stories of people who have quickly recovered from serious illness or injury, yet leaves me crying in disappointment.  I will probably keep trying a few of the exercises and methods for awhile, but I don't hold any hope of them suddenly starting to work at this point 
 Brit-think, Ameri-think is extremely outdated in its information about and analysis of the British population.  At times it borders on xenophobia.  I would strongly recommend avoiding this book 
 I was really excited about purchasing this book but ultimately very disappointed.  I have read many diet and nutrition books so this particular item was not impressive. The questionairre may be enlightening for someone who has either: never been on a diet, or never really thought much about their motivations behind food.  When I completed the questionairre it told me to Count Calories which I know from past experience does not work for me.   It does have some good information for a beginner. Maybe someone who just needs to take off 25 pounds of recent weight gain but I would not suggest this for anyone who has tried multiple diets. It won't tell you anything new 
 I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it!

 I am not a writer,or literary critic. I am an historian, was a C-123 pilot who flew with Air America pilots in the same Reserve Sqadron. I did fly combat missions over Cambodia and Laos in 1968 and 1969, and felt that one of the worst keep secrets was our activities in those areas. My problem with many of the current generation of writers, Robbins included, is they use only facts that keep their prejudices in line. For those of us who were sent to SEA by Johnson, and sent home by Nixon, we have a different view. Johnson and Kennedy stubled into the war. They were responsible for Air America being in place on Jan 21, 1969. Nixon, like all other Presidents before him, lied about things other Presidents had handed over to him. It is not my opinion, but brute historical fact, the War in Viet-Nam was not Nixon's fault - he was stuck with getting out. He ended the draft for a more equitable lottery system. When he took office, he began an immediate draw down of US forces. Air America was included in the pull back. Pilots of Air America were civilian employees of the CIA. They recieved "double time" for retirement credit. They were not true soldiers of fortune, as Robbins would have you believe, who were forced into drug and gun running. Those that did, were individuals who circumvented company law, and no different than individual writers and politicians who break the law. I think Robbins did his "research" in the bars of the world, not inside official records. Somebody has to pay for salaries and equipment, and that means authorizations and Congressional oversight. Without getting too political, I would remind the reader that the CIA started in 1947, under a Democratic President, and for most of its life, was paid out of funds designated by a Congress that controlled both Houses during the Viet-Nam war. I never voted or liked Nixon. That doesn't excuse me, or any writer of avoiding some simple facts that may make Nixon less of a villian 
 It is odd, and perhaps a bit sad, that John Irving has become or became American's literary sweetheart.  Given his narrative concerns, it would seem a wide readership would have never been his fate.  For one, he is fixated on the mutilation of the human body.  This mania with mutilation borders on the near fantastic in The World According to Garp. And more disturbingly still, is it completely infiltrates the narrative's sense of sexuality.  For the narrator of Garp, sex and bodily mutilation are nearly synonymous.  And what is the purpose of this overall fixation with the lopping off of limbs and the act of sex?  In The World According to Garp, sex is not viewed as a healthy or even human impulse.  It is only when the major characters divest themselves of lust, or sexual activity, that they extricate themselves from most of their mental woes.  It's a grim vision.  It is hard to envision flocks of readers gobbling this book in the late 70's and early 80's and viewing it as the great voice of our (or their) time.  The novel is also written on a high level of generality.  No reader should expect to plumb very deeply into the human condition in this novel.  Like Garp's writing itself, Irving's prose is witty and salacious, but never really gives the reader any serious human dilemma to masticate and digest.  There is something to chew, but it is light fare.  
 This is the first book I read by Shannon Drake. I thought the book was terrible. The hero wore a leather mask and is "rude" through out the book. He comes across as a mean and uncaring. Also the plot was overcomplicated(there are mulitple characters that don't add to the story). I could not get into the the story and ended up reading half of it and skimming the rest. 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 Some history and lots of free-associating tangents about this terrible disease but not much useful information on the actual diseas 
 No great revelations here -- wasn't expecting much anyway with the always dull Peter Golenbock as ghost writer.  Too bad too, Damon's story as a fascinating Thai/American elite athlete could have been penned as a compelling one.  Was looking for even a minor crescendo during the improbable 2004 ALCS comeback against the Bronx Bombers but nothing really ever ultimately gelled.  The book could have vastly improved from better identification of dates and times and avoidance of extensive rehashing of prior events with no added detail.  Saved from one star hell by the inclusion of a pretty good photos section.  As if the poor writing wasn't enough, idiot mistakes abound, from misspelling the names of numerous major leaguers (Scott Sauerbeck as Scott Sauerbach, Bucky Jacobsen as Bucky Jacobson) to basic errors in game details.  You'd think Golenbock would be improving as a writer after his many collaborations with other sports figures.  Damon either exerted too much editorial control, or, more likely, it's time for Golenbock to hang up his spikes.. 
 Again, Sherrill has produced a book worth examining for wonderful pictures, and step-by-step techniques.  My greatest concern is once again finding the trademarked material TYVEK utilized in craft work.  The makers of TYVEK specifically have stated it is never to be heated or used other than for what it is specifically designed for.  Deathly toxic, once more it is appalling to find it used with a 'heat outdoors' statement attached.  Does the company know this material is being used this way???  As an art educator I must not only be aware of this safety info for myself but for my students.  Poor editing let this one slip by 
 I read Lucky or Smart after receiving a recommendation from a very creditable source.  However, it was a great disappointment, and in my opinion, a waste of money.  $13.95 (as per the inside cover of the book) for 58 pages that delivered little value.    Bo Peabody may himself be both lucky and smart for founding and selling a low revenue-no profit generating internet company during the internet bubble; I hope you are lucky enough to read this review and then smart enough to avoid purchasing his book.  My brief summary of the lessons from the book follows:  Chapter 1:  Start a company that is innovative, morally compelling and philosophically positive;  this will attract smart, motivated people that will do great things because they are smart and motivated (Enron aside) Chapter 2:  you are born an entrepreneur or a manager - accept who you are because you cannot change Chapter 3:  entrepreneurs are B students, managers are A students - unfortunately I was a B student in high school and an A student in college, something the author does not address Chapter 4:  strive to be good enough to survive; if you do you will be bought by a company that can make you great; but don't be great on your own or you will not survive Chapter 5:  have faith Chapter 6:  don't take no for an answer Chapter 7:  entrepreneurs don't have power - "get used to it" Chapter 8:  stay calm and be gracious in difficult situations Chapter 9:  read the WSJ daily, the NY times on Sunday and pick one other reputable weekly or monthly business magazine - and don't read any other form of press Chapter 10:  always sell Chapter 11:  know what you don't know  after reading the above there is no reason for you to purchase the book unless you want to know more about Bo Peabody or the companies he founded.  That is all there is, except for a number of tangentially related stories that involve Bo and his limited experiences in the business world (I say this because he was in his early thirties when this book was written).  Instead of reading Lucky or Smart I would highly recommend the Richest Man in Babylon or Rich Dad Poor Dad.   
 This is a delicate subject which has interested and concerned me for some time now. I've always found it difficult to know how to respond when I find out that someone is gay, and it's even more confusing and potentially devastating if it's someone close to you, like a family member or someone you love. Acceptance would be one straightforward option, if it weren't such a challenging concept in the context of "family", or someone you "love". This book's emphasis seems to be in trying to make the gay person realise that they can change, and then applying whatever pressure is necessary to make them do so. This is all very well, but in my experience gay people are usually very reluctant to change, and even claim that their gaiety is something they're born with. We more melancholy members of society can find such attachment to gayness disconcerting, and it's therefore understandable that members of a morose family would want to undermine any gayness in their midst at whatever cost. Some would say that people of all temperaments across the whole range of emotions, from ecstatic elation to suicidal depression, just have to accept each other and get on with things the best they can. However, this doesn't take into account the fact that, as highlighted by this book, love often necessitates cruelty, especially where excessive gaiety is concerned 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 If you have had little or no exposure to North American culture or media, this book would provide you with all of the fundamentals of the upper class.  Beyond that, Lisa Johnson's advice seems largely based upon common sense or on how to not be lower class.  Very little useful specific information is given.  I also disliked the author's approach to meeting people.  In the unlikely event that one does see a millionaire in the 7-11, it's just not the sort of place that one socializes and properly meets people.  Yet that's just the sort of thing that is suggested by the author.  The general lack of propriety in her methods is what makes this book poor instruction unless you really need the basics.  Try Ginie Polo Sayles's book for something a bit more useful 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 I don't know what type of Italian/American family other people grew up in, but I grew up in a loving family with wonderful warm traditions, holidays filled with love, humor and great food, songs sung in Italian, stories of the old country and a door that was always open with the coffee on the stove...I found none of that nostalgia here.  What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.  If you are looking for a book that not only will translate swears from Italian, but will show you pictures of the gestures as well, or teaches you the correct Italian response to someone farting, this one is for you 
 Sorry folks, I just wasn't feelin' this one. I've been down with Diesel since System, but this, in my opinion, is his least-desirable album this decade. One thing I did like about this record was its clean production and mastering, thus making it sound good even on low-budget systems. But overall, this record came off as rather soulless to me, which is kind of ironic, considering the title. Technically, it's pretty tight, I admit, but the track selection on both discs is lukewarm at best. Disc 2 was particularly disappointing considering that I dig many of Evol Intent's other (re)mixes.  Overall there wasn't a single magical moment or musical miracle in the whole 2+ hours of material, just "hard" beats and rough bass, none of which were fresh or innovative (or even that hard really). If you want sicker melodies, more dramatic breakdowns (and/or reconstructions), or maybe just the periodic emotional/contemplative moment amidst sufficiently hard/dark themes check The Dungeonmaster's Guide, or the even more eargasmic Project Human. If you just want to mosh, headbang, or blast your system at intersections, get this lifeless example of recent Drum n' Bass - which seemingly has become more a stage for adolescent expressions like "hip" and "hard", and less the forum of artistic license and musical advancement that it had briefly become 
 Two main comments.  Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.  This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform "tricks" with much on showmanship.  I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in "greeting" of your dog with other dogs and people.   Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.  I felt intimidated by it.  
 When I saw this toy it looked like it would be so cute so I bought it for my baby.  Coming from Sassy, I thought it must be good.  Boy, was I disappointed.  You pull the string, put in the water and, it just sits there with the string going back in.  I thought we had a broken one until I read the other reviews and they all said the same thing.  Sassy should be ashamed putting their good name on such a poor product.  It really isn't even worth 1 star, but you can't give 0 stars.  If I could I would definitely give this loser of a toy 0 stars.  How disappointing coming from a company who has won toy awards on so many other toys 
 Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books 
 I read this book with my bookclub.  It sounded witty and fun.  It was not.  It was very boring and a big let down.  Most of the stories went like this:  we found a dead body, this is what we did, then we went home.  My bookclub has been meeting many years.  This book was voted the worst book we have read as a group.  I would give it no stars if I could.  Don't waste your money 
 Once again we have a PhD wandering out into the business world without a  clue as to what real life business problems and solutions are all about.   The author needs to take a crash course in what "quality" and  "increased productivity" are all about.  The book really lacks in  areas of developing employee skills, loyalty, and taking a  "ownership" attitude 
 Unfortunately, this was one lackluster flick.  The Last Picture Show was great; Texasville just did not get off the ground. Too bad.  The cast was capable of something far better. If I had the DVD, I'd put it out where a garbage truck could run over it.  To put it out of its misery 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 Granted, instructional design is not easy! But this book (and the Dick & Carey model in general) go so far into minute details that the bigger picture is lost!   I liked the outlay of the chapters. Each chapter represents a step in the instructional design process. This is the best feature of the book. But then the model/book goes into minutia and makes for heavy & confusing reading. In fact, several times I found myself saying "I think I understood what they meant the first time they said it, but after they said it 10 different ways, including 3 charts & diagrams, now I'm not so sure!"  The use of the examples in the book, particularly the charts & diagrams add to the confusion rather than making things more clear! A further example of this, is that often page 113, for example, will reference a chart on page 118. So amist the confusion, you have to turn the page and look back and forth between the text and the chart.   I also don't care for the size of the book. It's irregular and adds to the cumbersome feel of the text.  While it's true that with instructional design, you have to get down to the nitty gritty detail, this textbook seems to wallow in it much, much too long!  
 I was highly anticipating this book but when I received it I became disappointed. Based on reviews and recommendations, I was hoping to find an exposition of Christ's teachings, i.e. the Sermon on the Mount, with the Older Testament scriptures as a back drop and context for His words. Unfortunately, what I found was an antithesis rather than continuity between Christ and the New Testament Scriptures over against the Older Testament Scriptures. One example of this is where the authors are [basically] saying that Christ and the New Testament abolished the penalty for capital crimes, i.e., the death penalty for murder. The book states that Genesis 9:6 is more than likely a proverb. They state that the New Testament only refers to the death penalty in a negative way, i.e., its abuse and misuse and therefore has been abolished.  Since when did man's abuse of any portion of God's law make that portion of the law null and void? It is my understanding that only God has the authority to make void any portion of His law. I don't understand how the authors reasoned from scripture to come up with such a conclusion and I would disagree strongly with it. I admit I did not read the entire book but after sampling just a small portion and finding what I consider a poor hermeneutic and exegesis on such an important ethical issue that is clearly taught in the scripture to be continual and binding on all people and nations, I lost confidence and interest and sent it back for a refund from the seller. It is too bad so many writers, readers, etc. pit the first 39 books of the Bible against the last 27 resulting in neo-nomianism (at best) to anti-nomianism (at worst).  I would recommend Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr.'s book: God's Law in the Modern World. It honors God's law and teaches God's law is for modern man and continually binding unless otherwise clearly nullfied by God himself through additional revelation. After all, it is His Law and Word and is not to be added to or taken away 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 If it was 1983, Blink-182 would be dismissed as "a poor man's Descendents" and given 1 and 2 star ratings for their albums in the Rolling Stone Album Guide. Here, of course, the writers conveniently skip over Alanis Morisette's early pop albums and give Jagged Little Pill (angry sold units in '95, and this record is reeeall angry) a near perfect rating. The 1983 and 1992 editions are much better reference guides, despite the fact that this edition covers much more ground. There's a clear difference between this and the older editions. Many of the album reviews here are no more critical than a write-up from a record label promoting product. A 5 star album is supposed to be perfect or nearly flawless. Dookie by Green Day is not a 5 star album. Kid Rock and Shania Twain have never and will never release 4 star albums. I love how the writers used to tear into hacks like the Osmonds and Olivia Newton John in earlier editions. The wit, the bite, and the critical integrity just aren't there anymore. Regardless, I bought it (all music geeks will), but I don't think this book should be anyone's last word on what albums to buy.  
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know.  The show was much better, you should buy that.  Kwame is much smater and deserved the job.  I can tell that this book is another promotional tool.  Don't waste even a cent on this book 
 To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his "wise" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 This magazine seems most interested in promoting books, etc. that it has a financial interest in--most notably lately the South Beach Diet. Prevention and it's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads.  Too bad, because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition, weight loss, exercise and natural remedies that isn't influenced by it's publishing partners and advertisers. Skip this one, and try Self or Health for a more well-rounded look at women's heath needs 
 I admit I didn't finish reading this book, as I was so confused after a few chapters that I gave up. 1. It is unclear what exactly Ladoux means by emotion. Sometimes it seems that he is only talking about emotions that result in an action. (Reasonable as that's what you can test) But there are passages when he talks about "liking" somebody as an emotion. I love my husband and I don't like Tom Cruise but I would hardly equate those feelings as equal emotions. If I read a recipe and think I'd like to taste it, is that the same as the rage I feel against people who have hurt me? They certainly have different origins in my brain (I think) 2. I got totally lost in his review of the psychological studies of emotion. Yes, the development of theories is an important part of the study but when I still can't tell what you are theorizing about, the various diagrams and referrals to studies didn't help. I also lost the logical steps in the argument, perhaps because the summary was brief; I didn't see how B logically followed A in some of his review of the theories. Perhaps the rest of the book redeems it, but if this book is written for the layperson, more care is needed in explaining the boundaries and definitions 
 After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.  Basically, I do Not like it...don't like the taste or texture; I am not really bothered by the smell once it is rinsed.    I eat Tofu products regularly and I also eat pasta occasionally and would rather eat my whole wheat pasta 1-2x/mth than eat this tofu-noodle regularly.  However, everyone has different tastes. So if you want to try it, get it from your local grocer (if they carry it), otherwise don't waste your money on ship/g 
 I'm shocked and astonished at the level of vitriol doled out to Susan Sontag by the other reviewers on this page - not because of the contents of her book, but because she voiced a certain dissent to the war-mongering and empty-headed patriotism currently sweeping the United States. Now, I'm not a great Sontag fan, and this book is a fairly insubstantial gathering of reviews and prefaces in no way comparable to her previous essays, which are certainly worth reading. But she spoke bravely against the prevailing mood, and if that isn't tolerated and respected.... well, Bin Laden's won 
 From reading the reviews of Santa Evita, one might actually conclude that the book is about her, about her life or about her times.  And that would be a mistake.  This novel is fundamentally about itself, making constant references to the writing of it, other writings, other authors, the process of writing, and other writings of this author.  I found the transitions out of context and jarring, as though I was being suddenly reminded that I was reading a book.  After a while, I found the de-constructing of Evita to be tiresome and not very original.  The subject of Evita Peron's life is an extremely colorful, bizarre and fascinating story in and of itself.  Somehow, I felt that the author had utilized this famous and powerful legend to manipulate the reader.  The segments of the narrative which are more "straight" and not self referential, are extremely compelling.  Then suddenly, I felt I had been caught in a mouse trap of deconstructionist trickery, and that Martinez had "used" his purported subject as a piece of cheese to lure me in.  Not nice.  
 In 1991, Twista came out and got into Guinness, then in 1993 B.O.N.E. released Faces of Death and then the classic EP "Creepin on ah come up" in 1994. I honestly think Twista and other chitown rappers didnt steal Bone's style because even though theyre both fast, bone harmonizes their flow, while twista harshly spits his. This album is a clear cut example of how Three 6 Mafia used Bone's style to come up. This album was originally released in 1995 and each of the members of the group sound almost identical to the Bone members. If you want my opinion, Three 6 used Bone's style to come up in the business and that is evidenced through the fact that in Three 6 today. "Stay Fly" and "Poppin My Collar" sound nothing like "Live By Yo Rep", all being good songs. Look at that to comparison with Bone ,, "East 1999" and "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" sound very similar to Bone's appearances in "Ridin", "Spit Yo Game", "Dont Forget About Us", and their solo work 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 I wouldn't expect any less from F.M. she is the tops in her field this story was so good I picked it up at three this afternoon and just finished at midnight couldn't stop laid it down long enough to warm up leftovers for dinner............was crying last two chapters but so enjoyable and a fun read of a real family in my heart. 
 I bought this book because I am a Kellerman fan and usually enjoy his work.  This one is far below his usual quality!  The characters are poorly developed and, by the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There are a bunch of contrived coincidences, which are simply ludicrous and insulting to the reader.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I was a little suspicious when I read all the amazing reviews.  I should have followed my hunch.  This book is mostly new age talk with no real advice (ie, "feel the blue and red flame of your inner love").  What am I supposed to do with that kind of advice?  If you're into that, good for you.  I'm gonna go look for some more practical advice 
 My daughter loves this book, but I hate it.  It shows pictures of a little girl standing in a potty, and with a potty on her head.  The accompanying text says that this is not what you do, but the pictures are compelling.  AFter reading this book, my daughter started standing in the potty, saying "no, no, no!"  I think the book would be a lot better if it only showed positive pictures 
 As have other reviewers, I found this book gives enough information to get me in trouble or to get me frustrated but doesn't give enough details or explanations or even examples to get me out of them.  You could do several things using the book but if you tried to do something very different from what he illustrated you'd probably get mysterious error messages and little or no help understanding what the problem is.  I have used the Missing Manual for going from Windows to Mac and found it far more helpful than this book.  I'd urge you to spend a bit more and get something much more complete.  I just bought "Applescript The Definitive Guide (2'nd. ed.)" by M. Neuburg and I'm hopeful it will meet my needs.  I notice there are several other books available here for beginners and I'd consider some of them before getting this one 
 I bought this CD.  I listened to this CD.  And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum.  I get jazz.  I love jazz.  I "get" spiritual jazz.  This music is a load of crap.  It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity.  That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make.  Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype.            
 This is an utter and total waste of time and money.   Be real to yourself and your child, get some professional advice, not this pathetic drivel 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A 2-HOUR DOUBLE DISC DVD WITH ALOT MORE INSIGHT AND DEPTH AND ALOT MORE MATCHES LIKE WHEN: LUGER BEAT HOGAN ON NITRO FOR THE TITLE IN 1997,MICK FOLEY'S TITLE WIN ALONG WITH THE CONTRAVERSIAL "POKE OF DOOM" MATCH WITH HOGAN AND NASH;BOTH I MIGHT ADD WERE AIRED ON THE SAME NIGHT.THERE IS ALOT OF STUFF AND FACTIODS MISSING ON THIS ONE FOLKS 
 I was enjoying this book until I reached page 176 and read the foreword to the Haroset recipe: "I suppose it's as well to start with the premise that there is no such thing as Jewish food.  This of course begets the wider political assertion that there is no such thing as a Jewish race.  Faith is not the decider, and culturally, geographically, physically, Jews are too dispersed and just too different to be contained within any one definition.  But perhaps it's simpler to stick with the eating..."  I could not continue reading after I read this passage 
 I have only received the paper for 2 weeks. Where is it? why did it stop comin 
 This sweater runs large the arms go over my knuckles & it's long in the waist. I bought this sweater in a large which is what the size chart indicated for me.( I'm 5'6 & wear a 10 or 12.)  It shedded alot. I was leaving fuzzies everywhere plus I wore this with a tan skirt & I had quite a bit of color transfer. Even though it was inexpensive I do not feel it's worth the price 
 Until I read culture clash I thought this book was probably mostly ok, if not someone superstitious. Since then I have realized that this book is more dangerous then good. The ideas in this book are mostly baseless, the methods in this book may "work", but they are definitely not the best, and can be very damaging do some breeds.  Please, if looking to buy a book, get culture clash first, then get this. You will then realize what I'm talking about 
 that I even read this book!  Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help! My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.  This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away.  I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO     
 I found this book amongst my roomate's things when we were moving out of our dorm for the summer. It had been an assigned reading for a Southwestern Literature at my college. I thought it seemed intresting enough so I picked it up over the summer and started to read. At first I really got into it. It's typical of Southwestern Lit. Full of magical realism, descriptions of the landscape, use of spanish and english.  At first I really got into it. I was fasinated by the charaters and liked the discursive narrative. About two-thirds through the book it seemed to fall flat. Fist, there author includes a story that had little relationship to the plot at all. The tangent did't add any "color" or anything elese redeamable, except to confuse the reader. Secondly, over half the book was focused on the intresting stories of the sisters. I really liked the characters, and I was intrested in their stories. I was hurt when they were all killed off, mostly in long painful deaths. I'm not a happy-ending kind of person, usally I find them sappy and mawkish. After finishing So far from God I was depressed. Althought the book has some artistic meritm this is not a fun read or a "beach read". If you really want a good read from this Genre, read the Milagro Beanfield War 
 ... and i absolutely love the first owen record and all american football.  how does one go from 5 stars to 2?  First, make obscenely personal songs all about yourself and a girl who broke up with you.  i have a tv for this kind of stuff.  then, just make the songs mediocre.  there are two really good songs though, although i would be embarrased to listen to it in front of anyone else (but i guess the same goes with the first owen album).  good songs=ghost of what..., and i'm not going anywhere.  i guess i just liked the atmospheric stuff better than the raw acoustic sound heard here 
 I received this product as a Christmas gift in 2006 and unfortunately it broke in March 2007.  I did like it for its small size, folding capability, and retractable cord, but I really was only able to use it for three months before it just wouldn't turn on any more.  Also, It only comes with one attachment for straight hair but not for curly hair.  I did like it ok for the time I had it, but since it stopped working completely, I can't give it a great review. 
 I bought this book because I wanted a crash course in bartending.  The ratings were so good, and I hadn't found a book that catored to my need, and so I ordered this one.  I was very disappointed.  It is somewhat informative and easy to read book, but it falls way short as a crash course in bartending.  There is a lot of useless info such as where beverages are made, etc. and not enough info on important matters for the beginner who wants to become a bartender.  I would not recommend this book; as a matter of fact I returned my copy 
 I've read nearly every one of Danielle Steel's vast collection of novels...and this is "hands down" the VERY WORSE piece of garbage she's ever written.  What a joke!  It was as if one of Ms Steel's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess!  Don't bother 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 I bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer.  The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone, however, it does NOT!!  The software needed to download the pictures is not correct. When we called the customer services they were of no help - they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem.  Apparently I am not the only person to have this problem with the product.  Again, the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate.  It does not work 
 The mother in law was overbearing, no doubt about that.  However, I rarely found myself empathising with Ellie at all.  She overreated to everything her mother did.  Ellie was just so childish, I wanted to slap her.    The most interesting aspect to the story was Ellie's relationship with her father.  I wish the author had spent more time on that.  Cause the "oh, my mother in law is so terrible" thing got old very quickly.    I adore Jane Green's other books, but not this one!  
 If you have read Time And Again, you will be extremely disappointed with this sequel. In the first book, Si Morley traveled into the past and there were long passages describing a long gone New York City that were well written and absorbing. Jack Finney tries to duplicate that by again sending Si back and all it comes off as is long winded and boring: an excruciatingly boring buildup just so Finney can introduce Al Jolson; page upon page of boring descriptions of vaudeville, clothing, architecture and early flight are other examples. If I did not know better, I would say that the kernel of this book (returning to the past to prevent WW I) was originally lopped off Time And Again in order to shorten that book and Jack Finney decided to expand it into full book length just to make a fast buck. He would have been better off re-issuing an expanded, "uncut" Time And Again rather than putting out this drivel 
 Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.  Main characters:  Squall- A member of SeeD, he is a jerk to everybody.  Zell-A member of SeeD, he is a surfer dude and a dunce.  Quistis-A teacher and a member of SeeD, she seems to like Squall...for one reason or another...  Seifer- Squall's rival, he is even worse then Squall.  Rinoa- A member of 'The owls',Square soft ran out of ideas, she is just like Aeris.  Selphie- A member of SeeD, she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts.  Laguna- A Galbadian soldier. He is the best charecter in the game.  Irvine-A member of SeeD, he is a lady's man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane.  This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made. The story is great, but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable. If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP, I would buy it, but only if they removed the draw system 
 I bought this book last month due to some good feedbacks. But when I read, it seems the book is too much unnecessary words just to make it look thick but the actual content is thin. I would recommend to learn from the help section of the flash program itself. It's much more clear and right to the point not like this book. From there then google up and you will find a lot of more better tutorials than this book and best of all, it's free 
 I love most Jack Links jerky products,however, I was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat - the flavor was lacking true pepper taste. It tasted like a bunch of powdered old HOT spices not a true fresh pepper cure. I think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using, as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste. I have not given up on Jack Links - just ordered their turkey jerky 
 I bought this book assuming it would give help in dealing with the  alcoholic but was very disappointed.  If you are doing research this book  may be fine, but it is not for self-help 
 Good God - I hated this book.  I pride myself on always completing a novel, regardless of my level of enjoyment, but at three quarters of the way through I had to put this book down.  It was so boring and dull.  If you have insomnia then this book is for you because you'll choose sleep over continuing to read.  Whereas Dan Brown's, DaVinci Code is fast paced, glossy and easy to follow along, this book is rough hewn, painfully unexciting and almost impossible to follow.  The clues between the connections in the artwork and the mystery trail are so obtuse that they are not worth one's time in trying to unravel.  Overall a very unsatisfying read 
 Ms murphy's books get better.As a late comer to these books I really enjoyed reading about how new characters came along I think the way the cats react to different events is really well done.Not owning a cat myself I would love one like Joe. but I suppose I'll have to make do with the neighbors cats who always seem to visit when anything is happening 
 I do not know why I bought this cd. Lousy 
 There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a "hell".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  "Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.  Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.  Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.  All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.  THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists 
 I bought this as my first book on homeopathic medicine in order to learn more about it.  My conclusion is that there is woefully inadequate evidence to support the theory.  If I were to claim to have a Toyota in my garage, you shouldn't be too surprised or demand extremely strong evidence in order to believe me.  This is because there are clearly many people who do in fact have a Toyota in the garage.  This is a very orinary claim.  On page 12 of Everybody's Guide, the author points out that "Most scientists believe that no medicine diluted more than 12c potency could have any biochemical effect, since it is improbable that any molecules of the original substance remain."  This belief is based on basic prinicples of the very well developed fields of Biology and Chemistry.  If Homeopathic medicine did work in dilutions more than 12c, it would shatter some basic principles of Chemistry and Biology.  Unlike religious leaders, scientists fantasize about making or proving a discovery that shatters currently accepted models.  This type of discovery can clearly lead to a Nobel prize and world-wide fame in the scientific community.  In order to believe a claim that shatters currently accepted models of Biology and Chemistry, we need evidence of extraordinary quality.  On page xiv in the preface, the author reports on a 1991 study by three Dutch professors.  Of 107 trials, they found 22 studies that met their criteria for scientific quality.  Of these, 15 showed that homeopathic medicines worked.    It is of course possible that these studies were somehow flawed or fraudulent, or that they lacked the statistical certainty to overthrow currently accepted science.  As I said, we need evidence of extraordinary quality.  I don't know what happened to the Dutch  professors after 1991, but I haven't seen any Nobel prizes awarded!  Things that really exist develop and improve over time.  Look how much science has advanced in the past 100 years.  How much has Homeopathy advanced in the past 180 years?  Not much as far as I can tell.  Save your money on Homeopatyic books and medicines.  Eat well, get plenty of excercise and sleep, and go to a real doctor when you have a medical problem 
 This book was VERY disappointing.  It was much more about swinging than about BDSM.  Any BDSM scenes were so stereotypical, it was worse than the free stories I can find online.  Also, this "strong, independent woman" is only so for about the first paragraph of the book.  The rest of the time, she is a mindless slave.  Oh, wait, that's right, she's not a real slave - she can over-rule her master any time she really wants to, which happens often throughout the book.  There is nothing in here about the conflicting forces wihtin her, and everything about her desire to please her master.  In all, I was very very disappointed with this book and I ended up throwing it away since I (unfortunately) didn't read it until after the 30-day return period 
 This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck 
 The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring.  The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing.  The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other.  Not my idea of a good time 
 What a horrible book. The writing style of the author is horrendous! Impossible to follow or even comprehend what he is trying to teach. All the information in this book is readily available online. Save your money and buy "Mastering the trade" by Scott instead 
 As a fan I felt that Keith Sweat suffered a huge sophmore slump with his I'll Give All My Love to You disc. The fast club orienated tracks just weren't as strong this time around and there were only two slow jams;I'll Give All My Love To You and Merry Go Round that impressed me. Sweat came back hard on his thrid CD Keep It Comin but this is the one Sweat CD that I gets little roation in my CD player 
 Scholinski attempts to attack the mental health field in her memoir "The Last Time I Wore a Dress." She asserts that she was held through her teenage years because she was not feminine enough in the eyes of idiot doctors. However, I found little evidence of her tomboy nature contributing to her hospitalization. Scholinski never considers the consequences of her actions, she is dishonest, histrionic, and self-absorbed. It is a lack of maturity, not femininity that causes Scholinski's downfall. Amazingly, Scholinski never sees her actions as having anything to do with the state of her existence. This short, simple, and repetitive novel is a memoir of denial 
 ...nothing is explained with much elegance or in a concise manner.  I used this book for an introductory/applied statistics course.  The authors have a knack for explaining the concepts in the most long winded and roundabout manner possible.  They  are wordy to the extent that it is difficult to follow the progression of specific topics.  Additionally, they have a hard time sepearating examples from the text in the way that future understanding in a section is dependent on reading the examples.  Could be a MUCH better book if it were about a quarter the current length.  I used this for a college class; would be more fit for a high school stat class 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 "Mother Courage and Her Children" is a repugnant play.  With odious characters, a misguided plot, and pitiable dialogue, it's a marvel this play has survived the times.  I would hate to see the play performed - pure torture.  A waste of time, and I do not recommend 
 BEWARE- If you are the type of person who constantly berates themselves and inflicts self-punishment, this book could lead you to become too scrupulous.  A priest told me to put the book away and get into some lighter reading.  We should all try to do our best to be good Christians, but we should be joyful and full of love.  This book could lead you into despair. While the dogma of hell shouldn't be taken lightly, we also need to be careful not to start seeing sin where sin doesn't exist and remember God's mercy 
 As a brazilian animator I tried to start to read this book by the Latin american section, and comprehensively, by the one that shows the status of animation in my country, Brazil, a reality that I know very well.I don't know where Mr. Bendazzi got his informations for this part of the book.What I know is that it's full of strange or, at least unknown names of people for most of the brazilian animators, illustrators figuring as animators, besides the absence of five or six of the really most important animators in my country.Because of all that,I'm affraid the rest of the book, at least in those sections telling about the animation in Latin America still needs to be revised 
 The back cover of the guide promisses "expert lessons".  Where?  It's just more general suggestions.  I already know I need to learn the counter system to be effective at this game.  The booklet with the game tells me that.  HOW PRIMA?  HOW DO I DO IT?  There's no lesson.  There's no how to. I'm still looking for the promised "gaurd breaks" list in the "character strategies" section.  Sounds like it's something I'd really like to try.  This guide makes it seem like an effective tool.  Too bad that other then a general description of what a guard break will do for me, there's no actual instruction on the technique.  Great I know all the character moves that you can't possibly hope to accomplish while the computer has you in a 99999 punch juggle. I can get that info for free on gamefaq.com. I was actually better as a button masher at this game than I am armed with this worthless guide 
 If you are looking for a book that gives meanings behind the names don't buy this book.  It only gives the author's opinion on the name or a list of famous people who share the name.  I also find that is does not have a good selection of names.  For example, it lists the name Torquil(which I have never heard of) but does not have the name Travis, and the book even mentions the name Travis in an opinion on another name.  I find it opinionated and poorly written 
 I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.  She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.  However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the "outlaw" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny. 
 This book is about a Jewish girl named Hannah Green who flees from Spain in fear of the Spanish Inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a Jew.  She comes to England with her father and lives as a Christian while following the Jewish religion in secrecy.  Through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy - for both Queen Mary and Elizabeth.   Throughout the book Hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for Queen Mary and what a wonderful woman she is.  It is well documented in history as well as this book about Queen Mary's burning of hundreds of non-Catholics at the stakes.  A practice that earned her the name - Bloody Mary.  The book is very sympathetic towards Queen Mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake - "only doing what she believed to be right in her heart".    The fact that Hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a Jew and continued to deeply love Queen Mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous. I could not help but roll my eyes every time I read how much Hannah loved and admired Queen Mary.  
 Beside the fact that time has long passed this book by, it is utterly unreadable given the tedious writing. The term "Cultural Creative" is so self-congratulatory and pretentious as to be nauseating. This is strictly for San Franciscans lost in a time warp 
 This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole) 
 Contrary to popular opinion on this website, I found this book to be boring, repetitive and badly written. It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types 
 This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel 
 I find this book extremely confusing.  Many names were utilize throughout the book which makes it hard to follow.  As an individual who is not familiar with the Mongolian  history, the author fails to elaborate or explain the details of why a character does something.  In this sense, I find the book disappointing.  It is also disappointing that it does not go in depth of Gengis Kahn's warefare strategy.  TWO THUMBS DOWN 
 I don't write many reviews, but this movie was just so pitifully lame that I felt it was my public duty to warn you about it. The fact that Amazon tries to bundle it with "House of 1,000 Corpses" must be some kind of joke! The dialogue and acting don't even rise to the standards of a made-for-TV movie. The cops don't look, talk, or act like cops, and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality (his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation).   Also, though they try to sell this as a horror film, it isn't. This film doesn't even try to be scary. The first half is a boring, brainless detective story with robotic detectives tracking down a pretentious Buffalo Bill-esque sociopath (Dee Snider). In the second half, our psycho gets released from prison, apparently reformed, but after the townspeople try to lynch him he goes bad again and has to be put down for good.  What really makes this a waste of time is that our psycho isn't even a killer. He captures his victims and tortures them for a while. And the torture is nothing terribly gruesome, either. His idea of torture apparently doesn't go much further than sewing his victims' mouths shut and giving them unwanted piercings. Then the cops find them and haul them off to the hospital. The only victim he actually kills dies accidentally. This dung heap of a movie is just not scary, and not worth your time 
 I like Alanis Morissette, but her voice is so un appealing with this song?  I could think of several other artist that could sing this song much better than she can.  I swear I wanted to puke when I heard her try to moan this song out.  My dog howled in dis- approval, need I say more 
 A beautiful young woman suspects that her astronaut husband might have been radically altered by an in flight astronaut. His partner has a suicidal freak-out, and so does his partner's wife. She learns that she is pregnant and so the stakes increase. Ultimately, a desperate ex-CIA man struggles to spill the beans to her. Will he make it? Will she?   There is suspense in this suspense/sci-fi film; unfortunately, it is unintentional. It consists in wondering when the film is going to get suspenseful. We know everything from the get-go. We know what the husband's secret is, and we know the wife will eventually find out. The only possible pay-off is that the director makes what happens, when Theron's character finally figures it out, interesting. Unfortunately, she only finds out for sure about an hour and a half into a film well shy of two hours. How interesting could the remainder be? You do the math.  I absolutely adore watching Charlize Theron, both for her obvious charisma, as well as her genuine dramatic ability. How she got sucked into this piece of dreck might serve as a lesson for her. It is certainly a mystery to me why a woman who could snag roles in "Celebrity" and "Cider House Rules" would select this script. Perhaps she felt she could save it, since the entire focus is on her character. She did not. The script and the direction made it simply impossible. Even a true Theron fan, like myself, will be sorely let down ( even more so for Depp fans, of which I am not one. 
 This book should have either covered a narrower base, or covered it's broad base more carefully. Halfway through I realized that about the only point I really was getting was "the East hates the West, in particular the Muslims hate the Jews."  There were lots more specifics, but I didn't feel as if there was enough context for them to help. Instead the specific examples clouded the meaning for me and distracted me from the real theme.  I had to finish it because I read if for a class, but unless you have to read it...don't. You can find much better writing 
 This is an okay compilation however its far from the best. If your looking for good punk music you wont find much of it here. Heres a list of the bands i thought were pretty good  The Offspring  Pennywise  Strung Out  Strike Anywhere  MxPx  Millencoln  No Use For A Name  Street Dogs  Plain White T's  I really hate emo music, And it's not like a really really hate all screamo/hardcore music its just that i really don't wanna hear like 40 songs in arow of it it almost sounds the same.  Hopfully next year there will be some more punkish bands on the tour such as Propagandhi, Nofx, Desendendents,Pennywise, Rise Against, Black Flag, Anti-Flag...et 
 We begin with a spark of consciousness, an instinctual  incentive to use our brain for survival. But before we've learned much of anything, we're already 'here'. Our consciousness isn't a result of  a required amount of computational power, its  there first. We know this intuitively, because we feel/know it first-hand  in ourselves, and make the fair assumption that other humans have this in common with us. (It's not that far of a leap in faith to assume a quality of self-awareness in animals, who have little if any discernable computational ability.) Somewhere along the line, some 'scientists'  forgot this, and theorized that when a machine got smart enough it would be more than a machine. This  has nothing to do with self-awareness any form we actually know it. Computers have been 'out-thinking' people in many ways for quite while, (mostly as a matter of simply being able to 'turn' to the correct 'page' of their theoretically unlimited 'memory' a billion times faster than we can), and yet they are still just machines. Getting them another billion times 'smarter' won't really change a thing, except, perhaps, for a more perfect illusion.  
 Most of the allegations made in this book, usually by rightwing mudslingers rather than leftwing ones, are old smears and distortions which have been disproven by responsible journalists (sadly, a disappearing breed.) Consider the source: Alexander Cockburn is an arrogant 'cocktail party vanguard' fake leftist who's best known for wacko conspiracy theories and vicious personal attacks 
 It is bad! As much  as I like "10 new songs", this one disappointed me a lot. 
 Horrible, horrible.... I wipe a tear form my face, jaw on the floor, wondering to myself, "how could my Jet make such a ... movie?" It starts out bad, and spirals into one of the worst thought out action strings I've ever seen (short of Jet's "the Master" (Hong Kong version). Some of his fights are tolerable but there is a scene with a helicopter that made my stomach turn in its total disregard of reality. I know, I know, you fans of spiritual kung-fu are mad at me now but be aware that this movie isn't set up that way. Frankly, I'd rather watch a Van-Dammage movie before enduring the torture of viewing this ... again. I'd suggest watching, or just buying, Fist of Legend and be happy in the knowledge that you have one of the finest fighting films of all time- with Jet Li of course 
 This book is written by a Christian layman, and is full of references to God and Jesus throughout the book. In my opinion, working with oneself with regards to any issue, should never be based on any religion of any kind. It should be independent of any religious belief.  The book talks a lot about love as the key to build friendships, like Jesus did. "love and be loved again". His rules to achieve deeper relationships are:  1. Assign top priority to your relationships 2. Cultivate transparency (be open and honest) 3. Dare to talk about your affection 4. Learn the gesture of love 5. Create space in your relationships  The book has a naive and unprofessional approach to the topic. While the author is aware of the fact that too much emotion, care, interest, help, kindness and so on could challenge the relationship, he does not give it much attention, and he even says that too much is better than too little, which is not always true.  It does not provide a way to get closer to the people you care for. There is nothing in this book, which is not already common knowlegde. Everything in the book is basic. It could go as a sweet and funny Christian book about friendships in general. But it is not a professional book about how to go from a regular friendship to a deep and close friendship 
 This was a Medieval Project in my 7th Grade Humanities class   The Summary: Catherine Called Birdy was a conflict type book. It was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. If you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. It is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book.  A phew funny things were when Catherine caught some objects on fire! Rating: I rated my book 2  stars because it was kind of boring. Why is because all the book was really about was Catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. When I did like it was when she tried to get out of each man. Who this book would be suited for:  I would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the Medieval times. Also is if you are interested in action books. 
 This book did not offer nearly enough real-life examples for thank you letters. Do not waste your money.  
 Global warming soapbox masquerading as science fiction. Like one of the previous reviewers said this guy used to be one of my favourite authors. This whole Destiny's Children series has been a waste of time for m 
 First off, this man has been notoriously known to steal jokes. As such, I wanted to see how his delivery of them were.  And even by that, I was disappointed. He also belittles you without even knowing it; he tends to explain his "jokes" after he executes them by yelling almost incoherently. Gee Carlos, thanks. I never would have guessed the meaning of, "beaners" unless you had explained it to me.  This man is a complete embarrassment to comedy. He steals jokes, ruins the execution of them, and thinks yelling to explain them is hilarious 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 This book is fun to read, yes, no question about that, the problem are the facts inside.  In the first pages I found the first error. I continued, but without knowing if what I was reading was true. For example, Mr. Comfort, in page 12, states: "It was another 2000 years later (at a time when science believed that the earth was flat) that the scriptures inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world." Well, the problem is that, first, Columbus wasn't inspired by scriptures and, second, in those times people didn't believe that the earth was flat.   I am a Christian, and I'm very disappointed. Mr. Comfort's efforts to find evidence of modern science, modern hygiene and even dinosaurs in the Bible are simply unbelievable, and many times feels forced. He even quotes famous people on the Bible, I mean, if Napoleon said anything good about the Bible, that is a proof of is supernatural origin? He founds what his eyes want to find, he understands what he wants to understand... The worst is that he sees things that are not there and compares it to data that is wrong... The result is a fun but messy book. 
 I read an early edition when I was an undergraduate, studying Psychology and Philosophy many years ago. At that time I did not take Shatz seriously,  considering it a work in the humanities.   I have not changed my mind, but I am surprised to see this and the Laingian school sustain its influence in medical psychiatry over the bodies and souls of what must be many ill people  who have been naive and vulnerable enough to have  fallen for this school of thought. There may even be a  resurgence of this direction, given the  present social and economic problems  in health care provision, though unrelated to  the substance of the medical arts.  Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has a chapter devoted in his book "The Invisible Plague" 'Why is the Epidemic Forgotten'  --THE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS, where he reviews the legacy of Foucault, Laing, Shatz, and other anti-scientific writers on the brain, (p. 302).  I could not write a better one 
 As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter, for example, are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable. I'd forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of Julia's Child's recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of Julie's life with Julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce. A slight exaggeration, but not by  much.  Proof that the human species hasn't advanced all that far on a culinary level, if we're supposed to be amused by all this. 
 I found it difficult to even complete the first chapter because of the verbose style of writing.  There are so many euphasims, comparions, tangents, etc. that the message is somehow overshadowed and it makes it  difficult to recall the main point the author was trying to make.  Not sure who the author's target audience was, but reading like this was worse than any graduate level text or professional journal that I have ever read. 
 I bought the CD on spec, figuring its The Lost Trailers...the band who'd brought me Under FM Waves, Horse, and Fire on the Pontchartrain..it HAS to be good.  I was wrong.  It sounds like the very worst of 'pop country' out there.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll enjoy this cd, if you prefer the story driven songs and interesting guitar work...save your money (( or if you are curious, you can buy my copy of the CD on ebay ) 
 I had the TomTom Go 510 for about 5 days before I decided to return it.  Overall, the user interface is great, and very easy to understand and configure.  The setup was easy, and I also thought that the windshield suction-cup mount worked well, which I know a lot of other people complained about.  The items that led me to return the unit are as follows: 1) Bluetooth hands free- the clarity on this wasn't bad on my end, but the anyone I talked to on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me well.  I had the external mic on my visor, so it was probably no more than 2 feet from my mouth.  Unless I was holding it in front of my mouth, the connection wasn't clear.  I also had problems where my Motorola RAZR V3 would simply disconnect from the TomTom for no reason, or send a call straight to voicemail rather than letting it ring through the TomTom. 2) The Point of Interest database is lacking.  I had read this in other articles, but didn't believe it could be that bad.  I was wrong! Basically, when it comes to restaurants, it only contains fast food, and aside from that, anything retail related is lacking.    If you are just looking for navigation where you aren't relying on POIs and don't need hands free calling, this unit would work fine...but then again, without those features you could get something much cheaper that would get the job done!  Overall, this product is not worth the money 
 I think I would've liked the book better if the author had said that it was "based on actual events". It read too much like a novel. While I have no problem with an author using creative license at times, some of the dialogue was too far fetched. I also found it impossible that he would know what the characters (for lack of a better term) were thinking, especially the target. There were at least two inconsistencies that I found. Not good. Makes you doubt the veracity of this version of the story. As a novel this would've worked. 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 The good news is that the money went to an excellent cause. The bad news is that the choice of artists and songs were not, in my opinion, worth listening to 
 I didn't make it to the end of this slow-paced, excruciatingly detailed novel. The characters, Jew and Arab alike, were more stereotypes than real human beings. The scenes written from the killer's point of view were embarrassingly overwritten; I don't like this technique as a rule, but these were among the worst I've seen. I'm a fan of richly detailed settings and slow-moving plots when a book is written well enough and has characters whose side stories are interesting enough, but this one didn't make the grade.   On a side note to those who have criticized this book's racist portrayal of overtones: I felt that the tone of the book was meant to reflect the prejudices of the main character. Maybe I'm attributing too much subtlety to Kellerman in assuming this was all intentional, but it would have been pointlessly naive for him to put pro-Arab sentiments in the mind of a conservative Israeli Jew 
 I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.  Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere) 
 Can capture analog video and produce cd-rom's but I expected the ability to produce DVD 
 I picked up a bargain copy of this at a bookstore and was glad I hadn't paid full price for it. The topic is interesting to me as I love eating at fine-dining restaurants, but this book was not a worthwhile exploration of that topic. I was hoping for the kind of insider scoop on restaurant operations you get from, say, Anthony Bourdain's books. Instead, this is all about how you, the lowly restaurant-going peasant, should suck up to hosts, waiters and chefs because what they do is soooo cool and you are soooo not worthy of their time and effort. I kept thinking of the term "scenester" when I read this - someone who is so interested in getting into the "hot" place du jour that they'll do anything short of humiliating themselves to get inside. The whole tone of the book is fawning towards chefs and restaurant owners/personnel and there's not really a lot of "insider" information here that you couldn't figure out for yourself. And the book is overcomplimentary towards restaurant people in the extreme. Shaw's book makes it seem like if a restaurant treats a customer poorly, it's obviously the customer's fault because fine restaurants run by celebrated chefs are pinnacles of perfection and couldn't possibly do anything wrong. It seemed to me like Shaw mainly wrote this book to give props to his chef friends and get accolades from people in the business for writing a book that made them look so good, and therefore get nsider access to even more chefs/restaurateurs (and free gourmet meals, of course). I don't think there was an honest intention here to give any kind of real "inside" story.  I agree with the reviewer who said this book is a lot like the discourse you'll find on eGullet, pretentious and self-righteously obsessed with details the average person could care less about. I couldn't even finish reading this. Another book for the charity pile, although frankly I feel bad about inflicting this on anyone else 
 Okay, I saw this musical with my school, at Ford's Theater of all places. A review I read there said that the reviewer was "enraptured" and "could hardly breathe." Me, I could hardly breathe for laughing so hard at the sheer stupidity of the songs. As for being enraptured, i DID have to stare hard at the stage a lot, simply because i forgot my glasses. . . Anyway, this music is pathetic, though it was fun to imitate afterwards. It's not worth seeing or listening to. It IS hard to write a musical about the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Why did they bother? In more simple terms, IT SUCKS!! 
 You really need the center to play with the doll unless you have other interactive pieces at home.  The food for the doll comes with the center as well as the rooms that make it toddler aged...my daughter wanted it for the potty training area but when she got it, she realized the doll didnt undress to actually train her.   It is a must buy if you get the doll; just try to buy on sale.  I don't like it because it is hard to store.  It is prettly flimsy to break down with every use.  You will need somekind of container for the pieces or they are easily lost 
 My 3 year old daughter received this as a gift and I can't believe the poor construction of this playset.  Pieces of cardboard are glued to the back of the castle for added support since the plastic on this thing is so cheap.  Since it's not very sturdy, it doesn't stand up on its own very well.  It fell over onto the carpet and the screws popped out.  So 1 week after getting it out of the box, it's broken.    Don't purchase this item.....it's not worth your time and money.       
 tried making some hard candy and it started to caramelize at the 230F point - not good!  i'm going to buy another thermometer from another company 
 I thought Bohemia was a country? No wait... it's an eating disorder, right 
 This book will certainly appeal to people who want to bash Saudi Arabia. The author, a Lebanese, shows a particularly Levantine distain for the Saudis. He considers them creatures from the sand and thus colors his entire commentary with more venom than really necessary.  Are there corrupt members of the Saudi ruling family? Certainly. Is the family, as a whole, corrupt? No. Many are pious, charitable, open-minded and liberal.  Aburish takes up too much time discussing what amounts to no more than street gossip and not enough on what's really going on.   He also factually misrepresents the early 20th C. in Saudi Arabia. It was a harsh place with a harsh justice. Feuding tribes slaughtered others; they did not "count coup" as did American Plains Indians. They fought viciously and were fought against viciously. It wasn't only Abdel Aziz who put his enemies to the sword--members of his own family were similarly treated by both other tribes and the Ottoman Turks.  It's really a pity that many will buy this book expecting to "get the goods" on the Saudis. What they are getting, instead, is spite expressed by a "civilized" Arab for his "dirty, sandy cousins". It's a frequent lament: "Oh, how could this uncultured Saudis have the luck to be sitting on all that oil, while we, the cultured elite, have nothing! 
 "A Medieval Feast" is a children's book on a feast held during the Middle Ages.  Since I was looking for a book on Medieval Cookery, and this title came up, I purchased it.  I shouldn't have.  It's a picture book  for young children, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Medieval  recipes or cookery.  If It wouldn't cost me the price of the book in  shipping, I'd send it back.  However, for children who would like a story  with a Medieval flare, this book is perfect for them, with lovely  illustrations by ALIKI 
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 When I bought this book, I was expecting helpful solutions, but all I got were general facts that most parents of autistic children already know.  The book definitely needed more specific information on how to handle problems. 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 What we have here is Moore retelling the stories of "Peter Pan", "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Wizard of Oz".  He strips the tales of their fantasy elements, placing the characters of Wendy, Alice and Dorothy in real life situations of sexual awakening.  Of course the idea of fairy tales and folklore carrying at their heart, themes of sexuality, is nothing new, but here Moore puts aside any pretense of masking those themes behind the fantastic.  We are delivered these tales from the mouths of the protaganists themselves, Wendy now middle aged, Dorothy several years into adulthood, and Alice apparently over 50.  The three meet as tenants in a French hotel on the eve of WWI.  Together they bond through their bizarre tales and form a three way affair, which is Moore's first mistake.  Far too much of the writing takes place in the present, and we are forced to bear witness to the laughable sexploits of the three.  I'm not adverse to sexual tension shown between the women, but page after page we are given graphic depictions of their encounters, complete with ridiculous banter.  The meat of "Lost Girls" should have been the tales themselves, but about half the writing is devoted to the asinine sexual escapades occuring at the hotel.  As for the tales themselves, they were inspired, particularly Wendy's tale, but the revelations contained within them not grand enough to warrant much more than a passing reflection.  I kept wondering when the series would redeem itself for such vulgarity, but it never fully did.  As for the art...  Apparently Melinda Gebbie was seeking to capture the feel of turn of the century children's literature, illustrations fitting for the original works from which this series pulled, but at that she fails miserabley.  Her work came off as completely uneducated and reminded me of Henry Darger ("Realms of the Unreal") minus the naive beauty.  Her splash pages succeed, but almost every cell in the books should have been rejected.  That brings me to an additional point- was anyone properly editing this!?  Time and again we are given errors in text, problems with the context of the writing itself, not to mention my previous complaints about moronic dialogue and far too much time spent with the women cavorting at the hotel, as well as a half baked tie in with the coming Great War.  Has Moore's past works made him immune from editorial criticism and censure?  It would appear so 
 this book is very helpful for both of us,we love to read this book together and try everything they mention...lots of fun 
 I'm glad that everyone else has had a good experience with this, but mine was horrible. This cart collapsed not once, but twice for me. The first time someone was there to catch it but the second time we were not so lucky and it crashed to the floor breaking dished and our microwave. Not worth the chance if you ask me 
 I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"  
 I bought this just before my third trimester when the back pain from lifting a 30 lb two-year-old all day long became absolutely unbearable.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting, and came nowhere near giving me the support in my back and belly that I was looking for.  It helped a teeny tiny bit, but the construction is such that it just can't provide much support (it's a little heavier-weight than a bra, with no additional elastic).  I bought the other one, by loving comfort, and was thrilled.  It's a little bit more intimidating, perhaps, and less, uh, sexy, but it really works in all the ways that this one didn't.  It slings my belly up nicely and takes over the work for my pained muscles.  Ahhhhh 
 If you enjoy simile-ridden narratives of Court TV, you'll probably enjoy this book. Dialogue and narrative are pretty evenly paced, and the storyline keeps the reader modestly engaged. Is it enthralling? By no means. Are there surprises? Only who really did it at the very end, otherwise everything is pretty perfunctory and matter of fact. We know the defendant didn't do it, and the suspicion cast on a third party is too obvious from the beginning to be the real culprit at the end.   The storyline is simple: A separated defense lawyer, who has had a liaison with his former boss's wife, decides against a conflict of interest to defend her against charges that she murdered her husband. The rest is pretty much the ins and outs of the trial - and a few diversionary, inconsequential motifs about another client and the attorney's embittered wife. All in all, a fairly ho-hum read. I even considered ditching the whole enterprise about midway, but am glad I persevered. Will I read another Martini? Only the other one I bought at the same time, but I otherwise wouldn't bother. 
 This book is OK as a VERY basic introduction to Icelandic. You learn the word for "coach" (ruta) before yes and no. Also, the exercises are short and insignificant. When you learn about declensions (probably the most important aspect of Icelandic grammar), all the book has is a long paragraph, a HUGE graph (with vauge footnotes "There is a subgroup of masculine nouns which has -ir instead of -ar in the nominitive plural and -i in the accusative plural". No hint of these words), and one, measly fill in the blank activity.  This is good if you want to become vaugely acquainted witht the language, or if you just want to learn a few phrases. For the serious Icelandic student, get the Teach Yourself book 
 I put this CD on my wish list before the preview tracks were available, so when I recieved it I was very dissapointed.  The version of Cool Water and Tumbling Tumbleweeds are just not the ones I remember--they seem a little to "speeded up".  In listening to some of the other preview tracks, I think I would have been happier with one of the older recordings when there were only 3 sons.  The harmonies are still good, it just is not what I remember 
 Susan Sontag used to say in interviews that she admired the way TS Eliot lived his life, specifically, TS Eliot never called attention to his own life, he wanted to be judged on his work.  That is a particularly modernist idea, one that Susan Sontag shared.  This book is really bad, every so often you get the feeling that the authors think there is a grand conspiracy going on and it is usually related to Sontag's bisexuality.  Sontag obviously wanted to have a large vision of the world and at times thought if she called herself a "woman writer" or a "bisexual writer", it would ghettoize her writing, which after all was the most important thing to her.  
 After waiting 2 months of the delivery I still have nothing.  There seems to be no way to contact Amazon about this.  Very poor service.  I recommend NOT ordering from them.  I'll have to arrange a charge back on the C 
 Although Gundry does well in this introductory book to give the reader pronunciation guides for names of persons, his syntax is incredibly poor.  Because his sentence structure is lacking, his intended meaning is confusing and requires at times a multiple read in order to make sense of his sentence 
 This book started off slow with the formation of the Hawaiian islands and just continued from there.  The second chapter was more insightful and interesting but it seemed to drag.  Several pages could have been cut or edited out.  It would have been better if this book moved through the years a little more swiftly, than dragging to each persons life.  It was very difficult to finish and this is one book I will not re-read again.  It was about as interesting as a school text book, without a teacher to bring out the lesson 
 Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents 
 He's done,he fell off just like Master P,No Limit,Ruff Ryders all them,murder Inc.His first 2 albums were good,between 1999-2002 was Pastor Troys glory years and when he had the juice.All You sucka Ass N*ggaz get over it 
 This book is nothing more than a bunch of nonsense. It contains endless statements making no sense. I was truly looking forward to a book that would be a refreshing alternative to most pop-psychology that's on the market. Instead I got a text that was written by someone who couldn't think. It was full of illogical, unsupported statements and arguments. If I could, I would demand my money back I'm that upset with my purchase.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone who has any ability to think whatsoever 
 This cannot be the real thing.  The scent doesn't last 5 minutes.  What a waste of $50.00.  I am so disappointed.  
  The prime reason anyone would buy this seemingly unreliable book is to find the best New England campites. However, the campsite numbers are incorrect. For instance, in the section on Lamoine State Park, the numbers on the campgound map do not match the official Maine State Park online map. In referring to the views of sites 48 through 54, the author states: "These are views of Frenchman's Bay and its islands worthy of the Rockfellers." The sites are not "along the road facing the ocean" and do not have such views. Due to such carelessness readers cannot rely on this book to make camping plans, some might infer.    
 This is my first purchase that I have been unhappy with.  The tingler arrived with two of the tingles off.  Attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful.  I had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response.  I would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address.

 A babbling stream of zen consciousness nonsense.   This book may be interesting to those who like new age poetry but if you're primarily looking to improve your writing craft - seek elsewhere.  There are a few nuggets of helpful wisdom here, but they are buried by reams of meandering memoir 
 I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!! 
 I'd love to give this collection of early Spider-man comics a higher rating, but I'm very disappointed in the physical construction of this thick paperback. About the third time I opened it, the entire glossy cover and spine popped off...leaving me with a sheaf of newsprint held together with a thin film of latex. Unfortunately, I've had the book for more than 30 days...so I'm stuck with it.  No complaints with the content or presentation...but don't expect the book to hold up for multiple readings 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 Similar to another reviewer, I bought the Andrew Lloyd Webber album after hearing so many rave reviews about the show itself, and having an interest in the Billy Wilder film of the same name. After listening to both albums (United Kindom and United States), it can only be said that LuPone slaughtered the role of the dramatic Norma Desmond. Her depiction of the role through her choral work was delivered flat, and was absolutely appauling, compared alongside the angelic voice of Glenn Close. Kevin Anderson also left much to be desired in this version with his register being awfully flat at times, which had me cringing, especially during the prologue of the show. However, orchestrations are beautiful in the UK version with some songs standing out especially. Cecil. B DeMille (Micahel Bauer) performs a touching 'Surrender', whilst LuPone's version 'As If We Never Said Goodbye' is full of emotion and tenderness. If you are willing to buy a CD with only two good songs on it, don't go past the World Premier Recording (UK). However, if you want an afternoon of music that you are unable to draw yourself away from, I can suggest to you that the Glenn Close United States version is the recording for you 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 Wow. Perhaps I'm just missing some awesome thing about the Stooges, but I was thoroughly unimpressed by this album. I only found 2 tracks that were listenable, "1969" and "No Fun" both of which sound pretty mainstream for the time period. The rest was some bizarrely boring attempt at being progressive or intriguing that in my opinion failed. I can't say too little about this album 
 This was absolutely horrible. A complete sycophant like Barnes shouldn't be writing about his fearless "rebel." Perhaps someone will write a good biography about Bush, but barnes isn't the one. If you like FOX News, you'll love this book. Otherwise, avoid at all costs 
 To endure life's inevitable roadblocks, we have to strive not for perfection, but contentment, and miraculously all the pain will go away -- for a while.  What he calls "curing" I call "coping with."  There is no cure for the hardships we all encounter along the way -- becoming a hermit is even worse, as you dwell on what's wrong.  Ultimately, all pain goes through a "receiving center" in the brain, and seratonin blocks the perception of pain and keeps it from "centralizing" in the nervous system.  In his diatribute to the ability to be pain-free, he refers a lot to his former book, BRAIN LONGEVITY, on which he collaborated with the same journalist who has written for several medical magazines.  He uses many "deficits" for possible causes of chronic pain, but specifically names seratonin as the worst, depending on one's pain tolerance threshold.  He says that women suffer more from chronic pain due to hormonal changes, that two-thirds of all patients at pain clinics are women with migraines.  Back pain is three times more prevelant in women, according to this doctor, and chronic muscle pain is ten times more common among the female sex.  All pain signals ultimately land in the brain, where they trigger thought, emotions, memories, and a complex array of biochemical events aimed at protecting your body from further harm.  With chronic pain, the alarm continues to shriek uselessly long after the physical danger has passed.   Seratonin is the body's single best pain-fighter, more important even than endorphins.  Seratonin deficit is a major culprit.  He emphasizes that suffering is one reaction to pain, but not the only possible reaction -- that it is possible to experience pain without suffering from it.  He admits that all lives contain some pain but, when you can experience it without suffering, "your chronic, disabling pain, for all practical purposes will be 'cured'."  Pain is the most common reason people go to doctors.  Dr. Scott Fishman, president of the American Academy of Pain Management feels, "We've wandered from the basic philosophy in medicine, where you cure what you can but always treat suffering, to being focused only on curing."  In the section about arthritis, he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve.  One example is plain aspirin which, he says destroys the cartilage, the "padding" which keeps bones from rubbing together.  This is the most common type called osteoarthritis.  It is thought that eighty percent have this type by the age of fifty, progressing as age does.  It involves hands, spine, hips, knees and feet (primarily in overweight people), and goes back to the cavemen.  Exercise therapy is touted as a natural substitute for medicine, but I know first hand that this type can cause more pain.  Rheumatoid is a disorder or malfunction of the immune system with more inflammation of the joints.  He says that this is most often in women between 25 and 50, with no known cure.  In this type, you have to learn to "conquer" as opposed to "cure."  He really only stresses what we all know, you just have to live with pain at varying times and in varying intensities.  If you try to follow all of his suggestions, not only would you spend all your time trying to locate and consume numerous herbal supplements and expensive foods, but your money, too.  Mort Crim once remarked, "forgiving someone can't change the past but it can transform the future."  Dr. Khalsa tried out this intensive program at the University of Arizona. I think he must have had all female subjects. It is not recommended to use this as a substitute for medical care, as needed, only as some suppositions.  More research is needed, I feel, and I wonder how long his program lasted.  I feel that traditional Pain Management, similar to what I had at Vanderbilt in Nashville is better -- but there is NO cure for pain.  That's an illusion 
 I USUALLY LOVE HOT POCKETS, BUT TRIED THIS TWO WEEKS AGO. TERRILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WAS GOING TO RATE IT O STARS. THEY TASTE TERRIBLE. THE PACKAGING IS DECEIVING. THERE IS TOO MUCH CHEESE WITH SPRINKLES OF SAUSAGE AND EGG. NASTY!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag 
   I liked the first two spy kids movies pretty well. The first one was well done and the acting great. The second one, was maybe a bit less than the first but still entertaining. This movie, however, was incredibly lame and absolutely boring.    My brother went to see it with my mom in theaters, and for some reason they came back saying it was soooo good. When it came out on DVD I watched it with my brother. Only twenty minutes into it I was wishing I could leave. All the "Amazing" 3-D, Computer animated sequences were giving me terriblel headaches and I no reason whatsoever to watch this drivel.    As a previous reviewer said, the spy kids series lost its charm after the second installment. In this movie they were trying to go out with a bang, but fell miles short of the finish line. The acting seemed stale and unemotional. The humor was lame and not even funny. And the whole things seemed like a weird dream the director thought might make a decent movie.    Overall, it seems to me that this was just one mega test for the even worse flop "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl". I have no appreciation for this director any more and unless he gives us something good fast, I probably won't be watching anymore of his films any time soon 
 We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old and he has yet to be interested in it. The music is very loud and he has no interest in playing with any of the buttons or objects on it. He does kick it and push it away from him, so I constantly have to push it back towards him. At 4 1/2 months old, he still is not that interested in it, but we keep trying it out each day to see if it will spark an interest. 
 This is a boring textbook. No real indepth stuff here. Not software specific and not helpful to people want to actually learn computer animation. If you want to "read about" and discover all the wonderful terms and the history of-what to call things then maybe. Don't be drawn in by its heavy use of well known imagery and pretty pictures. It just doesn't have substance. I wish they had renamed this book- with a subheading stating language and terminology.  Look at the firt edition which is now $6.00. Art is a learnt through application. A large point of understanding concepts is to apply them. This book lacks showing the latter.   Save your money 
 I just finished reading this from my local library.  As much as I love Mind over Matter and Robert Klein, this really isn't a funny book.  Maybe he didn't intend it to be, but with a title like that I thought it would be a lot more entertaining instead of blandly anecdotal.  It's really just one tale after another about women he slept with, in too much detail, or girls he fantasized about- again, too much information.  And the book ends abruptly before covering any of his success in the 70's, his political comedy, etc 
 It would take me too long to elaborate jut how insipid this book is. "The Program" is overkill in trying to find a mate. A lot of the suggestions iwll make you look like you're trying too hard or that you have very low standards.  Also maybe this book would work for someone in their late 40s and up but it's too drastic for someone in their mid to late thirties !   I'm somewhat under 35 (but very marriage centric) and thought this good would offer me innovative helpful tips for a thritysomething, instead it wants everyone to act desperate and seek out any semi okay man. A good example is a woman who Rachel had change he rentire wish list for a guy.  Instead of a Christian 6 foot tall professional man, she had her be open to a 5'6" blue collar atheist. Yeah that'll work out well.  I'd rather be single than settle for so much less. LOL  Believe me if you're hovering around 35, you have many more options and time to find a guy than Rachel gives you credit for  
 This book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from Computer Telephony magazine, without much editing or organization.  It lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing 
 I read this , but can barely remember what it said. Repetitive, stale, and  not well-written. I bought it for her name because I like the 'Best  American Erotica" books, but won't make that mistake again 
 Strangely, quite unlistenable. The tracks are foreign and not very musical. No excerpts from the hilarious dialogue of the movie. Just an oddity to your CD collection, if you're into that sort of thing. And this is coming from a die-hard Borat fan 
 Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods. 
 Good Lord, people must be busier than I thought. If you haven't been allowed to even think about your future after retirement, then maybe you will get something out of this book.  For the rest of us, this is drivel 
 I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net.  I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands.  You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address.  Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips.  Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers.  This makes it impossible, for example, to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time 
 This is book was a waste of time for me. While reading it, I stuck with it because I was hoping that it would have an ending that would make it worth it, but that doesn't ever happen. The ultimate flaw with the book is that it pretends as if its offering some kind of revolutionary ideology and it doesn't. It also suffers in that it makes allegations and criticisms, without backing them up, or offering solutions. The book comes off as some sort of weird propaganda, which makes it really hokey. Do yourself a favor and read something else. 
 As a busy mom with a small budget, I found this book not only unhelpful, but insulting.  The author's snobbish insistence that she never uses a salt shaker, and that she couldn't find a single store-bought vinaigrette that was up to her standards, is insulting to the millions of us who have to prepare dinner for our families out of regular grocery items.  Her "fast" salad recipes take up two pages, and a "quick" soup meal for her takes 25 minutes.  Not to mention, my budget doesn't lean towards ingredients like black olive tapenade and creme fraiche, and my family isn't likely to eat pasta with anchovies or sandwiches with fresh-ground pureed peas.  If you're after quick, easy, and realistic meals, stay away from the gourmet snobbery here and go for Sandra Lee's Semi-Homemade series 
 THIS BOOK WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME,IT HAD HARDLY ANY INFO,ALTHOUGH IT DID A GOOD PICTURES THEY WERE IN BLACK AND WHITE,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE 
 The book is very biased towards the Mau Mau side first of all.   Second she has relied heavily on oral textimonies which she fails to question the validity of. Some of these testimonies are laugh out loud ridiculous. She may have noted that testimonies like this have been through out of African and European courts for being made up in order to secure financial compensation. Elkins rubbishes similar statements made by European and Black loyalists.  Elkins also ignores or defends Mau Mau atrocities.  Lastly she asserts that 300,000 people died during the course of the emergency, the only evidence for this is the difference between two censuses. Colonial census were notoriously inaccurate and the main reason the British managed to hide any atrocities they did commit was because they were comitted small scale. 300,000 deaths would have been impossible to keep a secret. Anderson claims around 30,000 Mau Mau died during the course of the rebellion which is closer to the truth 
 The Metcalf's have produced a book rich in factoids, post-colonial sentimentalism, and wretched prose. Clearly, the authors had good intentions in terms of contriving a history that implored us to mock the sunny empire. However, instead of focusing on their keen ehtical duty to educate against empire, they should have considered the horror that comes with mirthless prose and inevitable colonization of  any passionate interest the reader ever had 
 should be the real title of this book - 
 NOT a good light.  The light is already fading and I don't use it very often.  Very disappointed 
 I've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light. So I was happy to find this one. However, with my first "Eagle" the alarm didn't go off. Amazon was great about the exchange for a new one (kudos). My repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won't light up and I have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on. I second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle. The loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning, but I put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough. 
 I received the wrong item.  It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my little girl and I had to hurry and find this item at another store.  The company still has not sent me a call ticket for UPS to come and pick it up so I can receive a refund after many emails.  I will not be purchasing from this company ever again 
 A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me & You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me & You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.

 Black Hawk Down hasn't got an interesting story on offer. When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu, Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them. From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down remains way below average. I think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns. As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more. (SARR)          
 IT IS A VERY INSPIRING BOOK I REALLY HATED IT SO THANK YOU FOR WRITTING IT! IT REALLY TOLD WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 I'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about Christianity.  By now, thanks to this film and the book of the same title, most individuals interested in Christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus.  That being said, I will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film, and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses.  As a movie the Code leaves much to be desired.  There are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in The Louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect.  For example, Langdon and detective Neveu, after successfully evading Captain Feche in the museum, strike a series of clues (writings, bloodstains, keys) that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover. Langdon and Detective Neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions that- if answered- might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction.  Ian McKellen, a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent, lacks complete credibility in this film.   So what went catastrophically wrong?  Well, it wasn't the book or its author Dan Brown, who has been selling copies of the Code faster then they can count them.  And although the performances were at best questionable, by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie.  The most obvious answer as to why the Code is so deficient is Ron Howard, the director.  Mr. Howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present The Da Vinci Code in a manner believable (as a film, not history) to the audience. I think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with, and had a pre-formulated supposition of Jesus and his relationship to Mary Magdalene 
 Are pastors so desperate for "success" as defined by this author they implement (what amounts to) power grab strategies.  The author starts from an assumption that "church growth" can only be acheived through adopting the "purpose driven" format which is also assumed to be THE way to reach the "unchurched".  According to the book, the pastor first needs to convince the congregation they've "lost their vision".  The pastor casts a new vision which includes the implementation of the "purpose driven" format and attempts to sell it to the congregation.  In order to make this work, old leadership must be dissolved and a new vision/transition team installed.  Church members who reject or question this "transition" are seen as "whiners and complainers". A whole chapter is devoted to  dealing with the opposition.  The author tells pastors to know who the "power brokers" are in the congregation and get their support up front, otherwise you will have to "fight them" or "run them off".   Southerland tells pastors to be willing to lose a significant portion of the congregation to this transition as some are "vision immune" (they can't catch the vision).      Why are churches and pastors eager to latch onto this gimmicky and commercialized way of doing church?  The methods promoted in "Transitioning" are, in my opinion manipulative, contrived and unChristlike 
 It was ok but was not my favorite.. 
 "Kids- consider sharing this book with your parents - they'll understand you better." Oh really Reilly? If you read this book you'll know more about Bill and that is all. His "straight talk" is just his regurgitated opinion, based on his experiences and presented as doctrine. It's a mixed bag of conservative and liberal views and reads like a first draft of a high school creative writing assignment - written during lunch hour 
 This book was written in 1930.This book was about a artist and his cat. Their was a high preist that came to the artist to ask him to paint a picture of their Lord Buddas death.This painting would include all the animals that came to be blessed by budda and a cat who refused budda teachings. The artist's cat good fortune was so happy that the artist painted a cat that she died and went to heaven from being overjoyed. When the priest saw the painting he was angered and refused to hang the picture in the church and the picture would be burned.I didnt have a favorite line in the story and Personally I wouldnt recomend this book to anyone. 
 The definitive book about Bill is "No One Left To Lie To", by Christopher Hitchens.  He knows how to take a scapel and wield it to reveal the core of a maggot. This book is way too soft 
 Blends Freudian psychology with pop Buddhism using vague language and empty metaphors to create an impractical guide devoid of meaning or depth 
 The only european characteristic of this cup is it's price.  The picture is deceiving - this thing is tiny. I could only put three of my fingers through it's ear.  I am definitely returning it to Amazon - in my mind, it's worth 5 bucks and is more of a for a kid than an adult. 
 This was a terrible disappointment.  More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting, it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.  There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.    There were, however, HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors, actors, film-writers, magazines and books.  There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.  Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again, there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.  If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.    There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.  If you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.  I think Mr. Baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 When I first got this book it looked like it would help me with martial arts and japanese moves. Boy was I wrong. The very fact that this is japanese animation would make the reader ASSUME this was japanese Battling. Instead, I got HUGE Bozos, throwing punches and absolutely no martial arts. In this book, Tadashi was so busy showing the angles of just one kick, that he has absolutely NO variety WHATSOEVER! I'm serious, just one move takes him up to four pages to get his point across. Do yourself a favor and skip Volume 4 MASTERING BATTLE AND ACTION MOVES in Tadashi's work 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 The sound is bad.  It just does not sound like the songs I remember.  It it either that Christopher is changing the songs tone or the recording just sucks.  Don't buy it 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 I expect a guide like this to pick up where the instruction manual leaves off.  But this book spends 3/4 of its pages just reproducing what is already included with the book's online and printed help.  The rest provides some very abstract ideas on strategy.  It does not tell you what units or buildings to build or when to build them.  Civ 4 is a great game, but you won't get much here.  Stick to the game's manual and visit some of the fan sites for helpful hints 
 If you're looking for he skill and talent of the likes of Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya, don't, I repeat-don't look here. While having some interesting elements, East Wind and Prayer are the only Asian albums I have purchased that have woefully dissapointed me. I love eclectic blends of Asian music combined with true talent. Neither East Wind nor Prayer appeal to me as anything close to enjoyable and aren't even in the same category as Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya. Save your $$ unless you enjoy Hip/Hop/Fusion/Asian/Ornamental blends not altogether well executed 
 As a James Michener fan I thought this would be his usual excellent book. It may be good for others, but it wasn't for me. Well duh, it is NON-Fiction. I'm sorry but it didn't have the usual Michener way of grabbing you. This is probably a great book for a studious reader, someone interest in the details of Spain (Iberia). Unless that's you maybe you should skip this one 
 This is in reguard to the Durkin-Hayes recording.  How the actors and director could ever believe they were doing justice to Shakespeare is beyond me.  A play that should run at most two and a half hours unabridged,  is drug out to a laborious 3 hour cut-and-slash abridgement.  The halting  monotone quality of the actors speech is, to say the least, tedious.  Maybe  there are some worthwhile moments on the second tape, but I couldn't make  it past the first.  For my own part this recording was a huge waste of  money 
 This novel is narrated by a senior at an exclusive boys' boarding school, portrayed as the type of place where all of the students are hiding their true selves.  Those who are wealthy try desperately to hide that fact, and those who are on scholarship, as is the narrator, try even harder to hide their heritage.  As this story is told from the point of view of one character, it is impossible to determine if this is actually true, or if his fear of being exposed as a fraud clouds his vision of everyone else.  It is hard for me to believe that these boys are so disconnected from each other.  According to the narrator, nobody is really friends with anybody else, despite the fact that they have been living with each other for so many years.  No student has any real relationship with any other student.  What is real, is literature.  Writers are artists, who form their own social club and are therefore able to escape the boxes into which their heritage has forced them.  It seems every boy at school aspires to write, and once every semester the class is rewarded with a visit from a famous author.  These visits are paired with writing contests, in which boys submit a piece of writing in the style of the famous author.  The student whose writing is chosen by the visiting author is rewarded with a private audience with him or her--an unbelievable honor for the student.  The narrator of the book is desperate for one of these audiences, and devastated when his opportunity to interact with Robert Frost and Ayn Rand passes him by.  When he finds that Ernest Hemingway is to be the next visiting author, he is willing to do anything, even plagiarize a story he comes across in a literary magazine, to meet the famous man.  Some of the parts of this story are interesting, especially those focused on the visiting authors.  I particularly liked the passages about Ayn Rand and was delighted when a boy asked her, quite seriously, "Who is John Galt?" and received nothing but looks of utter loathing in response.  I also liked the responses of the authors to the works of the students.  The boys submitted very earnest bits of poetry or fiction that were terribly misinterpreted by the authors who judged them and read much more into them than the boys had ever anticipated or expected.  However, I didn't really connect with any of the characters, perhaps because the narrator of the story never got close to anyone.  He talks about his roommate and how the two of them lived together for years and kept seeming like they might become friends, but it never really happened.  In fact, the narrator, although friendly with many, seems to have no actual friends.  There is only one girl who might be a love interest in the story, but the narrator also has only minimal feelings for her.  In the end, this lack of interest for anyone in the story left me feeling rather uninterested in everything, as well. 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 So for the most part, people have been giving this book good reviews.  My personal opinion is that the book is terrible.  Part of the problem with books of this nature is that historians don't understand biology, and biologists don't understand history.  Kelly's major fault lies in his understanding of plague's biology.  He suggests that the Black Death may have been the reason for the increased frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion.  He cites an article from 1998.  I doubt he read the article nor anything about the topic further.  In the original journal article (Stephens, et al., [1998], Am. J. Hum. Gen., 62:1507-1515), the Swedes, at 14%, have the highest frequency of the deletion with the Chinese as the lowest.  The Black Death struck China too, so why do so few people have the deletion there?  This same problem plagues (pun very much intended) Scott & Duncan's work (Biology of Plagues, 2001; Return of the World's Greatest Serial Killer, 2005).  What Kelly fails to miss is the abundance of research that shows that Y. pestis doesn't interact with the chemokine receptors, which would have caused the elevation of frequency (the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion confers protection against AIDS).  This is just one of many faults in his presentation of Y. pestis as the causative agent of the Black Death.  He also plagarizes; see p. 25 of his work and p. 24 of Herlihy's The Black Death and the Transformation of the West 
 The book contains the really most basic and well known tips - nothing more, you better look in the internet and find far more informative websites. I gave it one star beacuse the amazing photos in the book which made by wonderful photographers. Buy a album insted or Michael Langford's guid if you are a beginner who wants to learn the basics.   
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 I bought this copy of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful classic because the illustrations were so lovely.  When I read the book however, I realized that this book, albeit with beautiful illustrations, was heavily abridged.  I am sorely disappointed by this, and feel it should be clearly marked in the labeling of the book 
 As a clinician-scientist, I believe in evidence based medicine There is no evidence base to support the work-out shown here to my knowledge have been proven to build bones as opposed to other types of exercise. As scientist from respected institution like NASA can tell you, the only most important way the body needs to stimulate bone building is periodic weight-bearing exercises & stepping. The same view is shared by neurophysiologists of NIH of USA This kind of title is extremely misleading & should be taken with a grain of sal 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 While the kids love it, it's a headache for parents. It takes forever to inflate, even with an air compressor, thanks to many individual air chambers. As other reviewers noted, it's best not to leave it outside (the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage), but it's far too big to leave up inside the house. Not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down. I gave ours away 
 This book is OK, but considering how many books are out there on this subject, I'm amazed at its high cost.  Unfortunately, my professor chose this book for our class, so I need to get it.  On the positive side, the book is available at our library so I will just photocopy the needed articles without having to actually purchase the book.  Professors, please think about the cost of the books you require your students to buy.  This kind of price gouging in the textbook market has to stop 
 I am completely disgusted that she has the nerve to even think that! Sharon Rocha is Laci's voice. This book is just another in the long line of books in the Peterson cash cow extravaganza. "For Laci" is a much better choice if you want to read about the Peterson case 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism.  It's Gray's defining characteristic.  After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the  best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring 
 Like the fact that Saddam committed genocide attempts in his mass murder of Iraqi Kurds in the 1980's (during his Anfal campaign). Brigham mentions Saddam's invasion of Kuwait distinctly enough but that was one of Saddam's secondary crimes compared to his dreaded Anfal Campaign 
 If you are preparing for the CISA,do not waste your money on this book. Put your money towards the ISACA's study materials. I found several errors as well as disagreements between this book and ISACA's study guide. 
 Why is this DVD (and many others only available in the U.S.) restricted to region 1? Does Time Life (and others) want to keep the bluegrass community neat and tiny? Why are people outside the U.S. and Canada not allowed to watch this dvd?? 
 I bought Power Reading by mistake at the bookstore - meant to get Peter Kump's Break-through Rapid Reading instead - and only had time to return it 5 days later. During the 5 days, I read Chapter 1 and browsed through the rest of the book.  Power Reading is to be done over 4 weeks. There are 4 chapters in the book - one for each week. It covers the same speed reading fundamentals every other speed reading book covers: regulation with a finger, having a purpose, how to approach different materials, high-speed techniques.  What I didn't like about Power Reading is that there wasn't much of anything in there. It talks about things like concentration and comprehension, reading purpose, note taking etc, but only skims the surface. I wanted to know why I should be doing the things it recommends and how they would help, but the explanations in there weren't sufficient to satisfy my curiosity and give me a reason to keep the book.  I returned Power Reading 5 days later, exchanging it for Peter Kump's book. Absolutely no regrets. Comprehension and recall/retention of material are very important to me. Having these while reading at tremendous speeds is a true sign of speed reader. Power Reading barely covered these topics, but Break-through Rapid Reading talks a lot about them and gives you drills to improve both.  If you are a beginner, get Peter Kump's book instead. If you are at an intermediate or advanced level, get Peter Kump's book instead. As there isn't any new information in Power Reading and you can finish reading it in a day, you can save yourself some money by borrowing it from the library instead 
 I was excited about the premise of having Mother Mary appear in someone's home and seek refuse for a week.  What a wonderful idea.    I began the book with enthusiasm, and for a few chapters enjoyed reading it.  However, often things were presented in a shopping list style.  It was not simply "this had occurred", but "this had happened, and this had happened, and this had happened". After a while I felt like I was listening to a teenager talk about her life, not a grown women.    The most alluring parts of the book for me, were the telling of how Mother Mary had an infulence in the world and the miracles that had come about in her name.  The rest was like someone just introducing these events and letting us know how excited she was to have her in her home.  She wasn't able bring across how someone might feel having had such a miracle occur in her life 
 This movie could've been something, had they gotten some real actors, a script and a director. Well, they didn't, and this movie is an embarassment to mankind 
 I've read this book and it works if you use it but its nothing new.  If you want to save yourself some time from buying it drink water eat a well balanced meal, and exercise.  Everything Oprah touches turns to gold.  If only I could get 14.95 for my advice 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 ...to be something it's not. The only tracks that I found catchy was their song from 8th and Ocean "Beautiful Love" and "You". The rest of the CD is forgetable and bored me. So stay away!!  Not recommended 
 A nice heavy timer, but even when I put it in the same room that I'm in, I usually do not hear the timer if there is any other sound going on - voices, TV, radio, etc.  I've had two other timers - that eventually wore out from use - I rate this below average 
 A graduate program had the audacity to use this as a text.  I would say this is a solid community college level text, or perhaps an intro to communications text for a 4 year course.  Most definitely not a graduate course level text.

 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 Murs just isn't a good as he thinks he is, at least not on this album, or his last one.  At one point on the album he says "...that's why 3:16 was genius".  Sorry, but 3:16 was mediocre.  Murs sounds better when he's rhyming over Ant's beats alongside Slug.  9th Wonder's production comes off as amateurish when compared to the stuff on the Felt albums.  Murs should drop 9th Wonder and get somebody else to produce his albums for him.  Get RJD2 or something.  
 This book is a real dissapointment.  If you love bland food and only moderately interesting taste this books for you.  I have been cooking for 35 years 
 National Geographic Magazine is famous for their excellent photography; it is the very reason I picked up this volume. However, Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places failed to live up to my expectations. I was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images, but mostly by the poorly executed concept. In a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured, I felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales. Furthermore, the organization was too loose. The book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories, but of the photos themselves, which are often stretched in an unflattering matter.  
 Is this Deaver's worst book? I honestly don't know because I haven't read everything he's written. However, I can emphatically say this is the worst of his books I have read -- and I have read most.  (... 
 Some people collect Tarot decks for their art, and this deck is indeed attractive.  Some use the Tarot as a personal mediation tool, and for those who wish to meditate on specific feminine aspects, this deck may prove useful.  As a divination tool, I found it didn't suit my needs.  The artwork, while lovely, has a misty quality to it, which can make it rather hard to focus on details.  Some of the images are just too blurred.  (As an aside, a color-blind person really ought to avoid this deck, more than one person with color-vision problems has mentioned the cards all look 'muddy'.)  The cards are large, making them difficult to shuffle for multiple-card layouts.  Since this is a "Goddess' tarot, traditionally 'male' cards in the Major Arcana are replaced with Goddess figures (though there are still 'King" cards, and so forth), and that's where it gets bumpy for me.  It felt like the deck's creator really had to dig to find Goddess to match the archetypes associated with the Major Arcana, resulting in the presentation of Goddess-figures that may be unfamiliar to those either more accustomed to a particular tradition, or haven't a working background of world mythology.  Also, since the Major Arcana draws from *so many* different cultures, the Goddess aspects are truncated, and shifting from Norse, to Egyptian, to Celtic, to Indian, to Russian, and even to archetypes that really aren't 'Goddesses' but women prominent in myth and legend...  disturbs the flow of the Major Arcana.    The Major Arcana is supposed to reflect the spiritual journey, from the beginning (to use the deck's name) to the last, the World/Universe.  Jumping around from culture to culture, giving only the most basic introduction to these Goddesses is distracting to say the least.  Some of the attributions are inaccurate, as well.  Each suit of the Minor Arcana is, with this deck, the 'Path' of a particular Goddess.  To Frejya is given the Suit of Cups, the 'water' suit, and the suit of emotions.  Frejya is not 'just' the Norse goddess of love and beauty, She is also a Warrior Goddess, chief of the Valkyries, a teacher of shamanic magic, a strong fertility goddess, and She receives half of the chosen slain the Valkyries escort to Asgard.  (Since there actually *is* a 'Path of Freyja' in a certain tradition, it's doubly off.)  This deck reduces Her to the 'Love Goddes' and diminishes Her in the processs.  If so much is overlooked with this one Goddess I know well, I question the accuracy of other attributions made to the other Goddesses.  It seems more like the Goddesses were made to fit into a prescribed role--which hardly seems respectful.  The decks is *called* the Goddess Tarot, but really only shows one aspect of the Goddess--the gentle, nurturing face.  Traditionally 'tough' cards like The Tower, Death, the Nine and Ten of Swords, the Fives (in all suits) have their edges smoothed down.  While some might find this makes the deck easier to 'handle' ( can't help but feel that it diminishes the accuracy, and reduces the impact of the cards that *are* reflections of gentleness and healing--the Four of Swords, the Two of Cups, the Queens, etc.  This is really the only 'Goddess-focused' deck I've worked with, and so I cannot compare with similar decks.  This was a very good attempt at creating a deck that emphasized the Goddess--I simply believe it's a shame that the decision was made to narrow that focus further, and thus limiting the range of the deck 
 I listened to this work on CD.  It took two attempts before I completed it.  I completed listening to the first CD and thought I had missed something so I re-doubled my efforts and began again.  I came away with the feeling that there were a couple of things of value but overall you will really have to dig deep to find them.  Also, if you are a Christian reader/listener you won't get past track one on the first CD.   Even after studying world religions in college and living in Asia for a year, I was left with very little to walk away with from this book.  
 As a Christian with Jewish friends, I read the book hoping to learn more about the "life-centered" aspects of Judaism.  The title drew me in. However, I found the book very offensive to Christians. Granted, the rabbi is writing about Judaism, but the "slams" against Christianity--as others have put it so well--have no place in the book.  Kushner admits that some Jews believe this, others believe that, but his attitude seems to be that all Jews are very observant. I gather that Judaism is based on actions and, the rabbi thinks, that Christianity is based on faith alone. Devout Christians pray morning, noon, night and compline; read devotional texts based on scripture--both Hebrew Bible and New Testament; read special materials during the long period of repentance and reflecton we call Lent--not just a week or 10 days, but 40 days not counting Sundays; although we must repent each day and pray for forgiveness, and certainly do so each week in church, Lent calls us to 40 days of prayer, fasting and other disciplines--but it isn't supposed to be on display.  Jesus opposed that;  we hold a three-hour vigil on Passion Friday; say grace before meals and sometimes after. Our religion stresses the need to repent our sins, ask God for forgiveness (no "pagan" elements, thank you, Rabbi; just the One God). Do good works, be charitable. We have two to seven sacraments, dependng on the church, and many Holy Days, of which Easter is the holiest.  Much of what Jesus taught is very similar to what Hillel and others taught. Kushner says Christians need Jews to remind us that there is more to religion than faith (something like that). We get it. And that Jews need Christians to remind them to share what is so great about Judaism ... except that if Judaism had spread widely, he said, it wouldn't be Judaism because it's a "community" as much as a religion ... an ethnic group.  OK.  I went into the book very open-minded, receptive even, looking for the "life," the joy I hear there is supposed to be in Judaism.  Telling me that I was born a pagan, that I'm still part pagan because Christianity is part pagan, and slamming Christianity throughout the book, made me angry. 
 I only watched this movie to see how bad it would be. Unfortunately I was proved right. I absolutely loved the original care bear movies from the 80's but this was awful compared to them. To borrow an old saying: "out with the new in with the old".     
 I LOVED the introduction of this book--it really challenged me to think about how the mind works, and taught me things about how the brain localizes emotions.  So far so good.  Then the good part...or so I thought.  Rather than a synthesis of the profound ideas of his Holiness the Dalai Lama, instead I was "treated" to a blow-by-blow of how the meetings with him were set up, how "special" Mr. Goleman is to have had such influence.  I could barely make it though the first in the series of seminars when I gave up.  Maybe there was more there, but I didn't make it far enough to find out.  And I blame the author and editors.  I don't know who would enjoy this book.  Goleman should have stopped at the introduction 
 If there's a worse movie than this I haven't seen it! Looks like it was made in a day. The quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits. Sort of like it was copied from a VHS tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6,000 times. The actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad Twilight Zone episode. If you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes. The musical performances are obscure little known Doo Wop Flops! (except for Frankie Lymon). Look.....I wasted $14.99 plus tax plus gas to "run out" and buy this bomb. The only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in Swedish, send it to a Greenwich Village "art house" and pass it off as a foreign film. Come to think of it....don't bother to dub it.....the sound is so off it looks dubbed already! IMPORTANT UPDATE.....PLEASE READ THIS! I later discovered after I wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50's. I understand that it is used constantly at the International Institute For Sleep Disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi-comcious near sleep state for incurable Insomniacs. And so as I write this update I've been watching the flick again and I must admit.....I.....(yawn) oh excuse me...where was I...oh yes I must admit that I.....(bigger yawn) Oh my goodness....I'm so sorry....This is so rude of me....(yawn) but it seems like.....(snoring)....I....(snoring) I just can't seem to (intense snoring)........ 
 This is an extremely superficial book. While the premise is good, the arguments are poorly developed. The author obviously wrote it to cash in on his notoriety from the OJ case 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 This book is not very pleasing.  The pictures are done in that "insane, stressed, spattered watercolour" style akin to the disturbing psycho comics out today.  The book is disguised as an alphabet book, but it does not have a good rhyme to it - and the pictures are harsh and "messy".  Finally, the fly who the child begins to identify with gets squashed in the end.  Not the kind of book I want to read to my son.  There are better books out there for the money 
 I bought and examined this book thoroughly. There are so many old concepts I wonder whether the author has ever re-read its current second edition. It is supposed to have been written for C++ programmers but of what generation? I understand that the current 2nd edition was written after the release of MS Visual C++ 4. So, the source code still assumes that C++ doesn't have the true and false Boolean constants since the author #defines them, which causes an error in both Visual C++ 6 and later. In fact, the use of #include <iostream.h> and void main()indicate that the book is not ANSI compliant. The web site that supports the book provides source code, for MSVC 4 (only after I bought the book, which is extremely expensive, did I find out on the 4th page that it was released in 1996; but the current C++ Standard is from 1998). I tried compiling them in MSVC6 and MSVC.NET. None of the programs compiled (none at all). Even after re-creating the programs by adding files manually, I received many many errors. I tried to fix them and also tried compiling from the Command Prompt, to no avail. It is true that we don't have that many books on compiler development but just as these books are rare, this particular one will be to no help. It is (very) old and its programs don't work. The only things you might get are the authors comments that may help you with some suggestions or guidance, which will be little 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 I bought this book after see the movie as a child still great loved every minute of it 
 I am a big Repairman Jack fan. I'm always on the lookout for his next novel and was excited to order this one.  I was surprised at how thin the book was. I was evem more surprised when I found I apparently ordered the large print edition with the special, giant margin art. The biggest shock of all came when I realized I've read this story before!   Sure, the publisher thought this was a great idea, but Mr. Wilson had to approve it and rewrite the story. I'm really disappointed, enough said 
  I purchased this Vantec product and used it for a short time.  Most USB enclosures offer "heat dissipation thru the metal case", as does this one. However, I grew very concerned about how hot the Vantec became, especially after active operation.   Heat is a major enemy of electrical motors. The HDD obviously just cooks inside the Vantec. There is also a definitive  difference between its temperature in stand-by mode, and during/immediately after active use.   I found another USB enclosure offering active ventilation: the Apricorn EZ Bus DT, which not only has a built-in fan, but IMHO, for several critical reasons, is a better design and a smarter choice.  Here is why:   The Apricorn's 3-inch diameter fan is mounted transversely, so it pulls heat directly off the entire underside of the HDD and expels thru vents on either end of the case.   In comparison, the Vantec's internal chassis has a solid metal plate which covers the entire HDD circuit board (see the image I loaded above).  The Vantec has no venting, so the heat inside builds up fast. I installed a 500GB HDD in the Apricorn and ran a 220+GB backup from the Vantec. Upon completion hours later, the Apricorn's exterior was completely cool to the touch; the Vantec's exterior was REALLY HOT.  A couple of other things I found superior about the Apricorn:   It's heavier with a wider base, compared to the Vantec's (3" vs. 1.5"). When mounted vertically, you can nudge the Vantec (or the desk it's sitting on) and it will fall over; it happened twice in the few days I used it. There would be major motion required to tip the Apricorn, and I've never toppled it in months of use.   The Apricorn's easy-action pushbutton power switch is conveniently (and sensibly) located on the front of the unit. The Vantec's is on the bottom of the rear panel (see photo above), but it's a stiff toggle-type switch and awkward to operate. You have to hold the Vantec down with one hand firmly in order to get enough leverage to operate the balky switch... and you leave a nice handprint on the case, which then has to be cleaned. Do that a few times and the sexy "mirror finish" isn't going to look new for very long.   Also, the Vantec's internal PC board HDD cable is mounted off-center on from the socket on any HDD. You have to kink the Vantec's flat cable in order to complete the connection (see photo above). The Apricorn's is located exactly in line with the HDD's connector, and requires no stressing of the cable.   The Apricorn is available here on Amazon, but I found it for less at Page Computers. It is slightly higher in cost than the Vantec, but I'm convinced it is a much better product. Also, with Apricorn's active ventilation and greater physical stability, I have peace of mind about the longevity & safety of the expensive drive mounted inside it 
 Before reading this book, I was extremely cautious to avoid any information/review which might spoil and prejudice my opinion.  In that I was successful.  It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.  I needn't have worried.  There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless.  I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, "Does he even *like* these characters?"  It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.  Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams 
 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 Full of beautiful pictures and containing much helpful information, one would think that this book is the perfect resource for home gardening enthusiasts and hydrangea lovers.  However, the most important information for gardeners without a degree in horticulture is the USDA Hardiness zone.  In my opinion, without this information, the book is useless.  I had high hopes that this book would contain it all; I was sorely disappointed.   Keep searching unless you just want to add one more hydrangea book to your collection 
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 This 'film' is a complete waste.  It's nothing more than monologues strung together played over scenes of minimal animation, that amounts to backgrounds moving.  And the script isn't even interesting, little more than a speaker talking in a monotone about skyscrapers created with 'sweat and semen mortar' 'thrusting into the gaping starry sky womb'.  I'm sorry, but that's just awful dialouge.  The writer is obviously attempting to sound profound, but just comes off as artifical and clichï¿½d.  The character designs are horrible as well, with disproportioned faces and bodies.    The whole mishmash reads as someone who's just purchased flash and completed on Intro to Philosophy class.  I STRONGLY advise you to pass on this 
 The only misstep so far in a wonderful series.  I was so eager for the book, I got a copy of the British edition, before it got to the US.  But I was disappointed.  Somehow this just just doesn't get off the ground.  Could Davis be tiring of Falco?  It seems to me that she is.  Maybe it's time to DO something, Lindsey!  Make some real changes in tbe characters' situations or kill them off.  Real dullness in the supporting cast and plot, and the main characters (besides Falso, who always has a life of his own) pall 
 I found this book very terse.  It seems like it could be a great book for someone already familar with topology, I don't recremend it for anyone who is not very familar with the subject.  It lacks examples of how to solve problems, then throws quite complicated ones at you very quickly.  A few mistakes in printing also 
 In the film commentary, Director Robert Altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying, 'I don't know what it was about but I really liked it.' (That's a paraphrase). And I think that's the key to why this film is so bad: The director didn't know what it was about.    The weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal 'psycho' music all the time.   Duvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That's it! The writer/director was confused!  A waste of talent, and a waste of my time watching it. It is one of those films I watched thinking it HAD to get better. It didn't. 
 I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be  assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 I have been on an endless search for headphones that I can use while running that provide good sound quality and are comfortable.  I have had little luck, so at this point I am now just trying to find something that doesn't hurt!  I was very excited to get this particular headphone!  I thought for sure it would be my answer.  Boy, was I ever wrong!!  Just to give you an idea of what poor design they are... I am back to using the buds that came with my Ipod.   The sound quality on this set is poor unless you really push the headphone deep down into the ear.  The part that wraps around the ear is painful.    
 I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category.  Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option.  Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took i 
 Advertised as yeast, sugar, mostly wheat, mostly milk free.  The bread & biscuits recipes all include wheat.  I was looking for yeast and wheat free recipes, quick breads, muffins.  Didn't find any?  Milk free recipes include butter.  Most of the recipes are for meals that would seldom, if every, have yeast in them. Egg salad recipe is the most bland stupid recipe I've seen.  Eggs, salt, celery, and safflower oil, wow. A granola recipe, no yeast obviously, wheat, barley, gluten, yes. I think the author owns an interest in a company that sells expeller-pressed safflower oil and clover honey because its in most recipes.  Don't buy this book unless you don't own a cookbook and want to own a poor one 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 As a teacher, I feel that this book can benefit all of my students in their quest for freedom as described by Tarthang Tulku. I especially recommend this resource for persons interested in learning more about their internal mechanisms or patterns of conditioning. This book has helped me learn what Freedom is really about in contrast to our president and others who base their understanding of freedom on religious beliefs, insecurities and prejudices 
 I come from a different view point then many because I belong to another church before being a member of the "OLD CHURCH" and thought that the "OLD CHURCH" was way off base.  I find that Mr. Flurry seems to be a bitter man.  He is not able to tell his story without making those who disagree with him as liars.  I find this sad.  He finds that his church has made no mistakes and that Mr. Armstrong could do no wrong except when he chose a successor.  I know personally those who have known Mr. Armstrong and while he was a great man, he was with error like all of us 
 Dear Public, This book is way too obvious - waste of money.  The author and his friends wrote all the 5 star reviews for this book and his last. 
 I have never read a book so boring in my life!  I read Erotique Noir, and  there were good poems here and there.  I was hoping Dark Eros would have  filled the gaps that were left by Erotique Noir, but the poems and writings  just got more and more boring.  There were VERY few writings I would have  even considered to be even remotley called erotica.  I am very dissapointed  in this effort.  Its seems who ever put it together has lost the passion we  feel as a pepole 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
  The good thing about this movie is that it didn't last more than it did. Not that it's bad, no, it's a fine depressing movie. It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.   This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.   The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.  Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony. I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle', where he plays a role opposite to this one 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 Preaching to the converted. Pun intended.  This book is not worth the paper it's been printed on.  Full of distortion, it relies heavily on marginal and controversial studies.  Similar book have been written throughout the Islamic history to try and refute Islam and show that Christianity hold the truth.     Perhaps the reader would be suited to read a book written by someone who is not biased against Islam, Mateen Elass, an Arabic name but a christian Arabic name, very popular in Syria and Iraq,( ask any Arab)  had presented a slanted picture on early Islamic  text collection repeating the old orienalist charge against the Quran and the followers of Muhammad.  To answer a previous reviewer, the reason Muslims resort sometimes the suicide bombing, is because they don't have the luxury of smart bomb that aren't so smart. They don't possess cluster or  napalm bombs that are been used daily against their children by the very peace loving Christians and Jews.  I hope that answers your question. 
 Not great. There are a few bright spots, but overall the book's sort of mediocre. Kids can figure all this stuff out on their own. 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa 
 This is a major disappointment as most of the beloved Carry On gang are missing. Sid James appears five times, Hattie Jacques only once and Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey not at all. Laughs are scarce and it's easy to see why this series was short lived 
 This was the 5th book I've read by Jodi Picoult, and the one I liked the least. I was intrigued by the subject of the book, as I have been with all of the subjects she has written about. But, this story did not measure up to my expectations at all.   This book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing, and could you/would you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time. One of the main characters is Cam MacDonald, who is the sheriff of Wheelock, Mass. Cam's cousin Jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to Cam, citing that he has just murdered his wife. Later, you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked Jamie to kill her. So naturally Jamie has to go on trial.   Well, a majority of the book turns out to be about Cam's adultery, which is annoying in and of itself. It seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok' since, as you discover, Cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it's expected of him. Plus, the person he has the affair with, he has known a day or so, which is ridiculous.   Interspersed throughout all of this, almost seeming like an afterthought, is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover.   I was very bored with this book, but continued to read it, thinking it was bound to pick up eventually. It never did. As it turned out, I ended up skimming the last 80 pages. If I were you, I'd pick another novel.   
 I bought this book thinking it was going to be a biography on Stevie. When I got it I found it to be a thin book with about 90% pictures. The man talked a bit about how he tried to get her to authorize it in the beginning. Then it was all black and white picutes. A few are kinda nice but most are just from a concert taken and they aren't real nice depictions of her. Toward the end he blabbers on about some other artists. Some Tori Amos lady and some other people. I can learn more about Stevie from reading articles free off the internet. I think it was a waste of money (...) on some black and white pictues that I could find better ones free off the internet. Don't waste your money on this book. It teaches you nothing about Stevie. I wish someone would just write a book about her. Like mabye Stevie should do one. She's supposed to but it says it was never published. The moral: don't bother. (...) I could have gotton that Street Angel cd I need

 Admission to America's elite colleges is an increasingly trying affair. An academically strong, middle class high school senior with no particular claim on a space, "un-hooked" as it is known, is faced with increasingly long odds of acceptance. The "un-hooked" applicant is squeezed by a dynamic made from increasing applications as more high school seniors go on to college and the colleges' own efforts to expand the applicant pool through increasing financial aid as well as recruiting international students even as they hold the number of places in freshman classes unchanged.  In this environment it is hardly a challenge to find a really sharp kid who was not accepted and also to find some "hooked" applicant who seemed rather less than qualified who was accepted. Venting on this situation provides a good release.   Golden vents well, but is unfortunately short on substance. Lacking quantitative data, the scope and scale of the matter escape Golden.   More importantly, Golden does not attempt to address what seems to be the most pressing question: What do we expect of these elite institutions? Do we require that they be social engineers? If yes, to what degree? Failing  an attempt to answer this question "The Price of Admission" is reduced to a voice only of frustration and angst.  For a more thought provoking read, see Harry Lewis's "Excellence Without a Soul". Lewis is not specifically concerened with admissions, as GOlden is, but Lewis is very much interested in the question of what an education at one of these elite institutions should be. 
 It is difficult to write a review --something which tends to be concrete and objective-- about a book which takes as a basic premise the escape of both rigid modes of analysis!  Patrick Henry's "Companion" is an  interesting book, from all angles: whether Christian or otherwise.  His  insights into the 'irony' of Christian life and God's grace in the world  are interesting, though they tend to speak less of "finding the marks  of God's grace in the world" (from the title) than finding the  author's own 'looking-back' interpretations of the events in his life.   Perhaps they are connected, perhaps one and the same; and that idea is, in  a way, one of Henry's main points.  This is an entertaining book, if  nothing else, and what may be found objectionable in the author's theology  is offset with his own humour and anecdote 
 With the burden of ideological narration, this documentary does not provide an in depth look at the history. It does not provide a fair and unprejudiced look at the events since the interviews are manipulated and edited together with an biased flow, without a good balance of academia and historians involved. We cannot get the "facts" from different points of view. "Goldberg's film presents a slanted historical account, according to some viewers who wrote into PBS stations and a scholar who participated in the panel discussion. If you only take one side and report their deaths, it seems like genocide. But of course it wasn't that, said Justin McCarthy, a professor of history at the University of Louisville. McCarthy, who acknowledges holding a minority view, believes Goldberg's film takes a selective snapshot of history and fails to address the deaths of many Turks at the hands of Armenian militants. "It was an inhuman, bestial time,  he said. There were wide-scale, mutual massacres across eastern and other areas of (the Ottoman Empire) a mutual- extermination kind of war." 
 When I saw this title, I thought of Uilleann Pipes and the music of Davy Spillane, or perhaps a collection of something even more esoteric.  Thinking that this would add a new dimension to my collection, I bought it without looking more closely.  I should have read Don Robertson's review, as he nailed it.  This is nothing more than another standard Scottish Highland Bagpipes recording, with a lie for a title.  Caveat emptor 
 This was not good news to me and does not represent who I am as a PCA Presbyterian woman, happily married and the mother of two sons. I resent how the author demeans women in her writing as if they are less intellegent than she is for choosing to submit to their husbands and staying home with their kids. There can only be one leader of a corporation, and one leader of a home; in a dance, one leads and one follows--two cannot lead in a dance, or there is no dance. The author has never studied Greek or Hebrew as far as the credentials state, and she is in no place to profess to be qualified in the exegesis of Scripture to prove her feminist agenda. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is a waste of time 
 Was given this book as a freebie--someone must be buying up copies.  For an Austinite, this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth-string techno-celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness--kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when Louis the XIV's chamber pot was carried by, except this isn't the Sun King, guys.  Get a life, or at least an authentic artist to swoon over--all of Garriott's stuff was strictly derivative.  Now that we have the real Lord of the Rings to watch, who cares about cheap imitations 
 British actor Anthony Hopkins was playing a African-American man who pretends he's Jewish. Hopkins did the role well and he managed to make me forget that he's playing a Black man from New Jersey. I can understand learning to speak properly but you don't pick up a slightly British accent. That would be pretentious. I just think there are actors that could have been more believable as Coleman Silk. Coleman is accused of racism after using the word "spook" when he mean "specter" or "ghost" because two students never appeared in his class. He never met them so he didn't know they were Black.  Nicole Kidman was playing a woman who came from a rich family who ran away from home at 14 after being sexually molested by her stepfather. She got on my nerves because she came across as she was on smack in every single scene. Coleman Silk falls in love with her despite the fact she seems psycho. I found it impossible to feel sorry Nicole's character. I thought she was capable of doing what her Vietnam Vet husband accused her of.   The best part of the movie were the flashbacks that Coleman (Anthony Hopkins) had of his youth. A younger Coleman was played by Wentworth Miller who was much more believable.  I don't want to say too much about the movie. I bet the book by Philip Roth is better and if anyone is interested maybe should read that instead.  
 This book had so much useless information I could barely get through it.  What a waste of paper!  I have loved watching the Mertzes on I Love Lucy, so I bought this book to learn a bit more about them.  Well, with the info that is in the book, that task could have been accomplished in 10 pages.  Instead there is a lot of useless, BORING, information that no one cares about.  Furthermore, It paints such ugly pictures of both of those people.  I am sorry I every bought this rag.  If you love Lucy & the Mertzes, you will honor them by NOT purchasing this book 
 The first book of Auster's New York trilogy was originally published in 1985, and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel. I've never read the original (or any of the other parts of the trilogy), so I can't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli's adaptation. However, I can say that since I'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature (those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Auster's story), this really didn't do anything for me at all. The story is basically an exercise in metafiction, and if you like that stuff, great -- I do not. It is dressed up (at least initially) in the mystery genre, but that's just window dressing. (There's a long legacy, especially in France, of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings (for example Alain Robbe-Grillet's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur, or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville.)  The story begins fairly straightforwardly: a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son. A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case. (The writer Paul Auster, and his family, shows up for one scene -- it's that kind of book.) Quinn meets with the strange man, who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father, who was seeking to discover the true language of God. The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report. Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he's been following, and his clients. He spends several months watching the building and going crazy. Once he realizes they've disappeared, he finds his own life has disappeared as well. Obviously this is all somewhat about identity, but it's more about fun stuff like language, representation, and other tiresome postmodern subjects (as are the other two parts of the trilogy, which involve a man spying on someone, and yet another disappearance).   It has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into. The simple, heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material, especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic. However, if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters, this is probably not for you. Fans of Auster may enjoy this, but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen. 
 I thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but I have to admit I'm disappointed with the recipes and with what I've baked from it so far.  I was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  I know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.  So I was a little skeptical, and then reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes.  The book already assumes a level of competence.  I made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie, and the Fudgy Brownies.  All three recipes tasted delicious, so I can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much, and I even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. I consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so right now I'm wondering if I should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up.  I think it's okay for a "base" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients 
 Kevin knows how to SELL a book, and he knows how to keep the money. He doesn't know anything about the subject he supposedly is writing about, but he knows what is most important to him: If he can trick you into buying this book with a money-back guarantee, you will tend not to return the book no matter how bad it is. And it is 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Seth's UK publisher apparently paid £1.4m for this book WITHOUT EVEN READING A WORD!  Any publisher prepared to cough up that amount of cash so recklessly deserves an entire omelette on their face and that is pretty much what they got.  Seth is a fine writer and this is a well-crafted book.  It tells the story of his uncle (a one-armed dentist) and his aunt (a German refugee) with whom he spent some time when he first came to England.  Their tale is interesting without being remarkable and this is where the problem really lies.  Two Lives would make a wonderful 100 page short memoir.  I say this with confidence as 100 of these 500+ pages are very good indeed.  The correspondence between the couple and the stories that the letters unearth are moving and compelling reading.  The rest of the book is a bit dull really.  Something his publisher would have noticed had they bothered to read it (if indeed those stories are true).  Ho hum, publishers have their own reasons for throwing good money away.  Shame that they could have supported a whole host of exciting new authors with just a small portion of the cash they wasted on this.  If you are interested in this book (and you will wonder why you were when you read it) for goodness sake wait for the paperback.  This edition is too heavy in every sense of the word 
 This book is a simple how-to book for the home do-it-your-self novice brewer.  The types of wine you can make was of most interest to me.  Great ideas.  And, of course, if you want to make ILLEGAL whisky, he gives you enought ideas to take off.  Great, simple methods book 
 The writing of this book is about as readable as a poor issue of Sports Illustrated, the book tied in with the release of the movie which was a flop and now Warners wants their money back, so as both a media tie in Book, and the movie, and the film maker who made it, everyone came out looking like fools 
 I hated this movie. SO unrealistic. Sure, maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating. But I AM a teenager in a city. NOBODY acts like this! What the hell is the point of this movie? To scare the crap out of parents? Also, the rape scene was vile. At first I respected the director for showing it and not shying away. A FULL MINUTE LATER, I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable. It wasn't even artistic, it was just disgusting and truly disturbing 
 While I am not qualified to pass judgement on sculpture as far as methods of actually creating works of art,as a art foundry owner,I have reasonable background in usage of diferent materials connected with sculpture. I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing  in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to "pink" heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere 
 Creationist A: Boy, am I getting frustrated.  The evolutionists have an incredible amount to evidence that's really hard to refute.  I mean, WE true believers know they're wrong, but to the general public, let's face it, the evolutionist case just looks too good.  They got TONS of science on their side. What can we do?  Creationist B: How about this. Why don't we get someone to write a book that says there are complex biological features that could not evolve because the parts they're made up of couldn't function alone.   CA: But haven't we already tried that dozens of times in various ways?  I mean, the evolutionists have always said that looking at complex end products doesn't tell the full story.  And you gotta admit, that makes sense.  I mean, the whole point they make is that biological features evolve in a slow, step by step process over huge spans of time, one small change at a time. In the meantime, they say, the transitional forms could become extinct, making it seem like a complex form came out of nowhere. Like I said, this is frustrating.  CB: You're missing the point.  I know a guy who's a biochemist.  He can write up something using all the technical jargon.  He can even get into things like genetics and DNA and all that stuff and make it sound really convincing. I mean, it's not gonna fool biologists or biochemists but let's face it, THEY aren't the ones we're trying to fool.  We'll call it "intelligent design" instead of "creationism" .  We'll try to make it sound like it's something new.  People won't know what to think. When they see it on bookstore shelves, a lot of people might just think it's actually a legitimate science book.  What are they gonna do?  Go out and take advanced university courses in biology and chemistry to find out for themselves?  They're gonna think it's real.  CA: I get it. You just want to deliberately create confusion among the general public by writing over their heads, even if you know what you've written is garbage.  CB.  Precisely.  CA: Very sneaky!  I like the way you think.  Let's just hope those people don't bother to look at other sources of information.  They might just find out this ID stuff is baloney.  CB:  Shhh!!!  You'll give it away!! 
 Bill, when will you just die?  if you read this feel free to email me evan.fett@gmail.co 
 I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it.  Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy.  They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash "Author's Message" in neon lights.  First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message.  I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason

 I've been receiving this magazine for almost 4 years now. It hasn't changed much since I started receiving it... and I pretty much still think of it as THE worst teen magazine that's still in business. I'm 16 now and haven't liked it anymore as I've gotten older. The strangest part about this magazine to me is the fact that they just keep sending it to me! I mean, I barely even remember when I was first subscribed to it (it was some kind of deal where you can get certain magazines for like 6 months or something, and I didn't have many choices so I picked this one). Eventually the other magazines stopped coming. But this one continued to come. And still does! I would have thought it might be nice if a company made an accidental error or something and continued to send me a magazine. I would have been thrilled if that happened with any other magazine (I actually don't mind Seventeen, Allure, CosmoGirl, TeenPeople occasionally, or even Teen Magazine.). But this one just makes me wonder if these people are downright stupid... the least they could have done is "accidentally" send it to someone who likes their magazine! If that person exists?  I think I read a fairly broad variety of teen magazines these days, so I'll try to discuss my dislikes about it in relation to those. So this is a comparison of this one versus: Seventeen, Cosmogirl, Ellegirl (I suspect it recently went out of print however), Teen Magazine, Teen People Magazine, Allure, Cosmopolitan, and Jane magazines.  1. Overall Value Conclusion: Teen Vogue= Very low value and overpriced.  SMALLER SIZE First off, one of the easiest things to see about this magazine when its on the shelf is the fact that it's SMALLER then the others. All of my magazines are about the same size. Except for this one; which is maybe as much as 2 inches shorter in height and 1 inch smaller in width. I don't know why the magazine makers decided to do this. In my opinion, it only draws more attention to the fact that while it is around the same price as the other magazines... they had to cut out at least something to make it smaller. Sounds like a RIP OFF to me. (...but I'm getting it for free for some reason, so I guess that's hardly my biggest concern. It may be yours though).  COST COMPARED TO CONTENT Magazine prices can be a little missleading at first glance. It's easy to find a thicker magazine and assume that MORE PAGES = BETTER VALUE? But that's not the case. The abundance of ads in a magazine can lead you to that conclusion, but there's a good chance you'll be disappointed when there are hardly any articles in between ad after ad after ad.   By the way... for those of you who aren't familiar with teen magazines these days, I hope you realize: THEY ALL HAVE ADS  This is the truth, but I don't see it as a terrible thing personally. When I was 11 and I first found an issue of Teen Magazine at the library, I was shocked at the ad content. But I used to read American Girl magazine (which had no ads) so I thought it was so bizarre. Now I don't mind it. I even save some of the ads because I like photography and looking at different angles of things. I don't think it's fair however, to hate Teen Vogue solely because of the ads though, as all the magazines are going to have ads. The amount of ad content in each one is the main thing that varies; so here's my interpretation...  Seventeen, Cosmogirl - Limited Ad content (They have more ads towards the beginning, and then they're much more spread out. Seventeen is probably my favorite magazine of the bunch and they manage to get by with one ad opposite of an article for a few pages and then a stop the ads for a few pages or so before they do it again. I find it highly tolerable) Teen Magazine - Even less Ad content. (I think they've really decreased the amount of ads over the years actually. They probably have the least ads of all my magazines) Teen People, Ellegirl, Jane - More than Seventeen and Cosmogirl but not terrible. Allure and Cosmopolitan = High ad content. (I almost put them seperately, but they are similar. They have a lot of ads I think, but for the most part, I don't mind. They manage to balance most of it out with enough articles and pictures to make buying the magazine worth while. The main difference I see is just in the choice of ads. Cosmopolitan puts in so many ads for sex related things and has many more vulgar ads. Allure I like more anyway. And I guess Cosmopolitan as a magazine focuses a whole lot more on sex already, so many teen moms may not appreciate their daughter reading it in the first place.)  TEEN VOGUE = HIGH AD CONTENT I'd say the ad content was very similar to the ad content in Cosmopolitan and Allure. However, the thing that pisses me off, is the fact that there isn't enough content to balance it out! (Maybe I mean "meaningful content" but more on that later...). The saddest part about this magazine is that I save more of the ads then I ever save articles. The ads really are more exciting then the content unfortunately...   2. Articles Conclusion TEEN VOGUE = FLUFF FILLED, UNIMPORTANT TO ME  Now, generally, I consider Seventeen to have the best articles (with cosmogirl in a close second) along with maybe Allure although it's addressed to an older crowd.  Reasons why I actually take the time to read the Seventeen articles, although I hardly even bother with the Teen Vogue ones:  A. Seventeen writes about something that actually interests me (ok, ok, so occasionally they have a little stinker. But overall, I think they do a good job.)Teen Vogue... does not.  I'm interested by things I haven't thought of before, or personal accounts of things that I would be unsure how to react to, issues that seem to happen everywhere but with stunning new facts enclosed and statistics to give me a perspective... etc. I could go on. But unfortunately, I don't think teen vogue has managed to intrigue me. Ever. A typical teen vogue article is something like "The Truth about Crystal Meth", "I was being bullied online!", blah blah. I can hardly even think of anything I've ever been interested by.  They have a tendency to focus on things that I already know are bad, things like drugs especially. It makes me feel like I'm being babied... like "Hey, well I bet you didn't know this.... if you do this your liver could turn black and blue and all the colors of the rainbow" and then pile a bunch of tear jerking stories of teens who had "no idea" of the dangers of _____ drug and then something terrible happened. I mean I think it's important that teens see the dangers in doing such things... I just get annoyed rather than enlightened when it seems like such an easy and obvious thing. Particularly when they make a big deal about it being so "unknown" and mysterious like nobody has ever heard of it before, when I know that most of the people I talk to every day do anyway. If I don't take the freaking drug... I won't have to worry about all the problems associated with it, and sometimes it's hard for me to be sympathetic to these girls who screw their lives up (especially when in the article, they make themselves seem like complete idiots!). I'm not anti drug articles though either. When Seventeen did one a while back, for example, it was an article (or maybe more of a chart?) of "Drugs that make you Ugly". Now that I found enlightening and very interesting. It didn't focus on one drug, but instead on one effect that many different drugs cause. Not only do I want to use the drugs less, I also feel like I'm more able to recognize the signs of its use, so I could identify the signs. It's important to me that magazine editors take the time to teach us something new, without beating us over again with the same stuff we hear everywhere else. Teen Vogue just hasn't figured that out yet.   B. I find the good advice in Seventeen meaningful. Teen Vogue... makes me wonder if I should be the one giving them good advice... I think I was most disappointed with Teen Vogue on this when they did an article that caught my eye about girls who are addicted to tanning. They spent nearly 2 whole pages rambling about different girls and their tanning habits (and general stupidity...). And BARELY even gave the reason why it's not a good idea. I remember reading one of the last sentences in my head over and over again. It was like "Remember to live your life and have fun, but try to be safe". I mean WTF??! You could be talking about anything with that. Cooking, driving, sex... it's so generic that it's stupid. The only thing that I got from that article was a justification that there really are a lot of stupid girls who are damaging their skin to be tan, and have no idea about it. Unfortunately, if these girls read teen vogue, they will probably never know either.  3. Features Conclusion TEEN VOGUE = ...are you serious? Um. I can't find a better word than worthless to describe this magazine's features. I used to like the "A room of my own" thing that they had at the back of my issue. It was nice to be inspired by the way that other girls kept their rooms based on what they liked. But in the last year... I think they managed to totally kill that part too. The uniquenesses and interesting things that once intrigued me a little have been replaced by more mediocre rooms by other girls (lately they've been somehow connected to a famous person. yeah, how exciting... not) that just don't inspire me at all.  Oh, and one of the second to last pages or so, there's a feature where they find some girl with "Style" and tell her to describe it and what brands she likes... blah blah. Occasionally (well, no, rarely), there will be something that I actually find interesting and want to save to remember. But most of the time it's just a bunch of 13 year olds trying to be trendy by throwing on the coolest things they know... all at the same time. No thank you. In most other magazines, I can appreciate a monthly space for something about hair, or makeup, or something related to beauty that I could find useful. Teen Vogue does not do this. But then again, everytime that I have seen them slip something along those lines in, they manage to make me question their intelligence. ("OMIGOD, Mom! Teen Vogue says I should put glittery pink eyeshadow up to my eyebrows so I can be cool. We have to go spend $67 now so that we can have the exact product that they used!" eek.) The makeup is useful... if you want to be a stage artist perhaps? I don't know... I'm still working on that one.  4. The Fashion Focus Conclusion TEEN VOGUE = FASHION HELP FOR THE EXTREMELY WEALTHY AND CONFUSED  If you disregard the fact that virtually everything in the magazine is rediculously overpriced and just unpractical... I suppose someone might find their fashion sense useful/inspirational somehow. But I'm afraid I do not. I remember skimming through one article that answered a question asking "How do I avoid looking like a tourist on vacation?" to which they answered with showing how you can pile on a bunch of random clothing pieces and come off as an idiot instead. How exciting... They also have a tendency to encourage readers to buy things by showing us models wearing such clothing. I wouldn't be surprised if the plus-size community completely gave up on them, in fact I'm surprised that there is no outrage over this.  Look teen vogue, I know Gemma Ward looks excellent in that (ok, I'm lying... but I can pretend, right?). But you see, me and Gemma, we have some differences. For example... Her thighs are probably less then half the size of mine, she's like half a foot taller then me, she weighs maybe half of what I do, and... well... she's a model that seems to look good in everything. I do not. And I refuse to let you convince me that such a hideous outfit won't look hideous on anyone else. Actually, I wonder if Gemma Ward could afford the things in their magazine. She's a super model afterall. But maybe after spending $150 on each pair of underwear... things begin to add up, even for her.  Darn...  The Bottom Line: Don't waste your money on this magazine (in fact, don't even get it accidentally for free like me, it's not worth your time). If you want to buy a teen girl a magazine subscription, try something like Seventeen, Cosmogirl, Teen People etc. Just about anything is better than this. 
 I went back to read this book and follow some sources and was surprised of what I found. I compared it to another book being sold here on Amazon, here is what I found. Now that the KGB has exposed their own double dealing in  putting out admitted false facts to under mine American freedoms and  society, I think Oliver Stone owes us an explanation! I mean, I guess he  never thought the Soviet Union would fall and files would get out showing  why and where false rumors were placed to attack our institutions'  creditability, did he? Well, in another book listed on this forum,  "The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret  History of the KGB" by Christopher Andrew, Vasili Mitrokhin has done  just that with verified, factual, papers taken from the KGB by KGB. All of  sudden KGB Agents working in America are coming out being exposed for the  first time. Oliver Stone fell for much of these rumors when making JFK as  shown by his own sources in this book. I think his reputation,  creditability and trustworthiness should not only be questioned but avoided  for incompetence, to say the least! Why would anyone want to promote  Communistic rumors about JFK's death in America. Oliver Stone did, but who  cares why! "The Sword and Shield" is written by a History Scholar  of the highest credentials while this book is written by a drunk driver,  that is all that needs to be said. I wonder if the films of  "Nixon" and we already know that Stone changed "On The  Fourth Of July" from what happened at the Democratic Convention to the  Republican Convention which was a total faslehood in an alleged biography.  It seems most of Stone's films are based on similar shoddy work by a  storyteller claiming he filmed history. Based on this book and knowing the  other book Oliver Stone should be ashamed of himself. After reading both  books I can only say, Oliver's last name is about what his life and  perceptions of life are all about, being STONE blind whne making reality 
 Excellent printing and binding - the text looks to be the professional work of a team - the reader is well drawn in - a great effort, but very artfully obscured are the facts that Syria was an independent nation just after WW1 - with internationally recognised and undisputed boundaries and a King enthroned - then France rapidly obtained a league of nations mandate - attacked Syrian troops and the King fled to the UK, in exile.   Subsequently, pieces of Syria were hacked off to form Palestine (in readiness for the later Israel), Trans-Jordan and Lebanon. Pieces were also give to Iraq and Turkey. Very un-Christian behaviour considering that Syrians fought shoulder-to-shoulder with us in WW1 to help defeat our enemies.  The author lays the Hindawi case firmly at Syria's door with a 'probable' authorisation by Assad. Victor Ostrovsky (former Mossad) says in his books that it was an Israeli false flag operation run by Mossad to break relations between the UK and Syria - and it worked.   Israel is treated in the text with a careful, almost fearful reverence, while Syria gets the usual just short of `evil people led by a wicked dictator' treatment. That is boringly predictable, not to mention academically emasculated - and demonstrates bad manners.  The book fails to reveal that Syria is absolutely controlled by twelve men from different families, and Assad is not one of those men. It is inconceivable that an author with such credentials could be unaware of this.  The Israel-Syria conflict (the US has no conflict - we have placed Syria on the state-sponsors of terrorism list, but our oil companies continue their decades-long activities in Syria. We take Al Qaeda prisoners to Syria from Iraq for interrogation -extraordinary renditions) is over the major waterways underneath the Golan heights - Israel doesn't wish to return them to their lawful owners. You won't find much about these subjects in the book.   Overall: This book is not the whole truth and in places it is downright misleading.  Occasionally the text shows rather a self-important attitude in places, as if US interests reign supreme in all minds, which they do not - 190 other nations who share the planet generally don't give a hoot, except when our wallet opens or we wheel out the missiles.   Such an attitude and fooling around in the middle east for the benefit of a few hundred Israeli settlers, trying to play impartial peace broker, when we are so close to Tel Aviv it is a farce to pretend such, has sadly led to the EU sailing clearly ahead - and they now have a larger army than ours, over 50% of world trade, 40% of the world's wealth, and the dollar is being widely ditched in favour of the Euro. Yes, American supremacy is coming to end, not because of enemies without, but because of this stupidity and attitude within - and its attendant lack of vision. It is also going some way to helping China become the richest nation by 2015 while we expend $ 5 billion credit (plus interest) a month in Iraq.   One reviewer found it was overly critical of Israel and Jews and that the religious attacks upon Muslims and Christians asserted by Assad were the opposite of reality.   These are extraordinary authoritative but misleading remarks from someone who plainly has never lived in Israel and Syria.  It was very widely reported in the media a few months that one religious student spat on the cross in a procession, and ripped the cross from an Archbishop's neck in Jerusalem. The Archbishop said that such spitting occurs about once a month. Is this the `opposite of reality'...?  The acid test for those unsure of the truth in a hail of propaganda surrounding the middle east conflict, is to visit both Syria and Israel - you will rapidly see what is fact and what is fiction. But as you make travel arrangements do not be surprised (as I was before a sojourn of several years in both countries), if you are advised not to visit one of the two countries - we are not to known what is really going on - you may pay taxes but button your lip as to how they're spent.  A look at the smashed and painstakingly looted church in Kuneitra (even the tabernacle and mouldings with icons were chiselled off and taken away for selling on the black market), the graves blown open and robbed, is quite an eye opener, although some will surely attribute this to an evil conspiracy to blame Israeli soldiers. You would have to ask the European forensic team about that, and Ambassador Aitkin. 
 well i bought this series agaisnst the star rating it has and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is badly written the acting is ham,and the actors of a standard that do not rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do not mean they score higher than ten. i cannot understand its  five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium, numbers,waking the dead,it should never have got passed the pilot.if i could i would rate it 0 stars.if there is a secound series i will not be buying it.  
 Pretentious and boring, too clever for its own good, the only good chapters in this book are the ones about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ, and there's not enough of that.  And this was the Michael Glenny translation 
 The press on this book indicated it was written with charm and wit.  Unfortunately it did not live up to that notice.  The author is pedantic and takes himself and his subject much too seriously 
 An excellent book for the same pretentious, self-congratulatory grown-ups who give themselves little kisses of self regard for their Channel 13 memberships and who shiver with uncontrollable pleasure at the very mention of "culture," or "art." Children, however, will be, as mine was, and I was, bored.  My child is too young to also have been repelled by Tony Kushner's fake, artsy-fartsy poeticisms that make reading the book out loud a tedius struggle, though he was not too young to have wondered, as I did, if an actual STORY was going to begin at some point. A good reliable general rule of thumb, especially where children's books are concerned, is that when critics fling about raves involving high school lit terms like "allegory" the cautious reader without a lot of loose pocket change will walk on by.  THE WILD THINGS, for eg, is a great book that hasn't got much of a story story, but that has a LOGIC and a story type rythym and language that doesn't try to force the ball out of the park 
 I've had this album for a year now, hoping my initial view of it would change, but it hasn't. I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the overall sound of this album sounds like a parody of their music. Not only that, it feels thin, formulaic, and lacking tasteful re-invention of their musical influences  compared to their previous releases. Alpha Beta Gaga stood out the most for me on this album; a pretty sweet whistle tune,  actually. If your new to AIR check out Premiers Symptomes first and go from there. You'll find some warm, dreamy, soulful instrumentation a la Serge Gainsbourg. Do not visit Montreal without this music 
 I had previously written a review here charging Mr. Levenda with poor scholarship and libelous treatment of Mr. Aleister Crowley and "his occult orders," it has developed, on my own faulty memory of an article written by another author.  The irony of my accusing Mr. Levenda of inaccuracy based on my own forgetfulness has not been lost on me, and has been a gentleman in correcting my error.  I would like to apologize to Mr. Levenda for my thoughtlessness and plan on buying his -- I'm sure -- excellent book in reparation to him.  
 Ice Cube was yet to release a bad album when this came out. I decided to buy it since Ice Cube is one of my favorite artists, but there isn't 1 good track on this entire CD. It is truly the only album I own that I would give a 1 star rating to, and I have some other fairly bad albums. Please do not listen to this if you want to hear good Ice Cube, any other release from him will do, but not this. His lyrics have gotten to be stupid at times, but by far the worst aspect of this album is the TERRIBLE production. I am not feeling the whole rock vibe at all, I mean it's cool Cube is expanding his musical horizons, but this isn't that way to do. Thankfully Cube's nex release, Volume 2 The Peace Disk was much better 
 It is true that the basics of good interviewing haven't change much over the years, but they have changed some.  And this book, while it was surely  a must-read in the 70s, is so outdated that I found myself skipping the  first chapter, then the second, then the third ... then much of the rest of  the book.  For example:  there is a full chapter, and several pages  scattered through the book, that talk about research techniques.  This is  pre-internet, pre-much-of-what's-out-there-today, and as a result, those 75  or so pages are useless.  The same is true for the roughly 25 or 30 pages  that talk about how to get an interview, and how to make a good first  appearance.  This is pre-email, and clearly pre-women's-lib.  Many of the  tips for women on how to get interviews and make sure they come out  successful are down right offensive to women today.  Fortunately, most  female interviewers no longer have to rely solely on looking nice, batting  eyelashes, and agreeing with everything their interviewee has to say.     Yes, there are a few good pointers, but to buy and read an entire book for  mearly a few pointers isn't necessary.  There was nothing here that I  hadn't seen elsewhere.  For a good, up-to-date book on interviewing, try  "Creative Interviewing," by Ken Metzler, it's over priced, but  filled with great and useful information 
 This was not good news to me and does not represent who I am as a PCA Presbyterian woman, happily married and the mother of two sons. I resent how the author demeans women in her writing as if they are less intellegent than she is for choosing to submit to their husbands and staying home with their kids. There can only be one leader of a corporation, and one leader of a home; in a dance, one leads and one follows--two cannot lead in a dance, or there is no dance. The author has never studied Greek or Hebrew as far as the credentials state, and she is in no place to profess to be qualified in the exegesis of Scripture to prove her feminist agenda. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is a waste of time 
 As another reviewer put it, this book was a chore to read. I don't know why I stuck with it, but I hate to not finish a book. The characters are so poorly drawn that it's impossible to care about any of them. They're also unlikeable for the most part. Others have commented on how Rachel continues to be drawn to Hank in spite of the fact that he's so mean and misogynistic. That's true, but I also can't see what Hank sees in Rachel -- I can't see the appeal. The dialog was completely unbelievable, and the story dragged. In all, a waste of time. In the end I dropped it in the trash, which I never do because I love books. I just wanted to protect other innocents from this drivel 
 joey pigza lit review        My lit circle book right now is not exciting because i don't like books but it doesn't make it a bad book to every one its just my opinion  but i would still recommend this to anyone who likes reading . Also this book would be a good book for anyone who might have a.d.d Cause joey also has a.d.d so for anyone this would be a book to read to relate to it. I  Would give this book a 0 if i could rate it cause it is kinda slow. . . . REALLY SLOW IN MY OPINION. This is a book for people who can sit still and read through a book.  wil 
 "The Third Sister", a Sense & Sensibility sequel, treads shallow waters, compromising between the two Barret `extremes' by being sufficiently plotted, but dull and predictable. Margaret, miraculously transformed into a fine, intelligent young lady (one has the impression that Barret watched Emma Thompson's film, which included a lively, appealing child Margaret) has to choose between two young men, one resembling Edward Ferrars in his reserve and quiet demeanor, the other resembling Willoughby in his good looks and `liveliness'. Unpredictably-or is it with complete predictability?- they are neither what Margaret thinks they are. And they are both shallow characters, very much like Margaret. There is very little emotional development and resonance between either and Margaret.  The language is just barely adequate, the events so unmemorable that I can just recall the skeleton of the plot relating to Margaret after 2 years of reading the book. If you must read something else by Barret, read "Presumption". If you wish for an excellent Austen sequel, read "Sanditon", completed by Marie Dobbs 
 I hated this book for all the same reasons that the previous reviewer loved it.  Latour's voice changes add some depth to the story, but are done in a manner so convoluted that much of the substance is lost.  Using Aramis itself as the voice of martyred technology just becomes increasingly absurd throughout the book.  There are much better books than this out there about man's relationship with technology, do yourself a favor and find one of them 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, because of the made-up disease which causes her to gain weight, and failure of the character to really learn what she needs to learn from this experience, it is sort of a waste.  Could have been written better - and doesn't get to the heart of the matter 
 Omg, I got these headphones and they suck!!! I am not even kidding, they are probably the worst headphones in the world and the worst headphones i've had in my life...first of all, when you listen to music there is a loud hissssss noise in the backround, second, these don't even fit over your freakin ears...haha, also, they are tooo bulky, you can't do anything with them...the sound quality is ok...but if your looking for noise cancelling headphones, i dont recommend these, i recommend the sony fontopia headphones or the 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones that are ear buds and not too bulky (availible at brookstones)...now those are what you call great, these panasonic earfones are just horrible compared to these, it only takes out like a little of the noise, but the sony 120 dollar ones at brookstone takes out 70% OF THE NOISE! that's amazing, it is probably why they are so expensive...well i have to leave but this is my advice to you DON'T EVER EVER BUY THESE HEADPHONES IN YOUR LIFE!!! THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!! hope this helped 
 I picked this book up on a whim, the cover looked cool, and I wish I hadn't.  This book was my first, and last, foray into the Kris LongKnife novels.  The only character development in the book consisted of everyone telling LongKnife what a great person she was.  That got real old after the 57th time that somebody brought up the "great" Longknife tradition.  The space battles were entertaining, but seemed to drag in parts.  The rest of the book was a bewildering collection of contrived scenes.  If you're looking for a great sci-fi series to get into, check out David Weber's Honor Harrington series.  Its everything that Mike Shepard is trying to mold the Kris Longknife novels into 
 Theory wise, the book exposes things relatively well.  However, I cannot get over how thoroughly maddening it is to be second-guessing the answers in the back of the book when you're trying to learn by doing.  For ...sake, it's the 3rd edition and it's still full of errors!  Inexcusable!  There's no way to build confidence in problem solving when many of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are wrong!  No matter how clear the theory, it's still a work in progress, incomplete at best.  It is, quite frankly, shameful to be passing this book off as some sort of learning tool 
 The second chapter is the nuts and bolts of financing equipment. The numbers are commonly wrong. There are WAY to many mistakes. This is a textbook for a heavy equipment class. It's the third week of the semester (Fresno State) and we're dying.. 
 I received this book as a gift. I read in this genre from time to time and usually the pace of the books is riveting. Here I was very restless and not interested in the characters. So many things happened that seemed far-fetched that I couldn't give the author much confidence. In the end I was happy to finish the book to just be done with it and disappointed at the ending 
 Extreme behaviour? I think not.  Perhaps extremely bad lyrics.  Was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow?  I just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel?  Could it get any sicker? I think the song should be retitled Welcome to Hell 
 I decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it.  The metal is thin and flimsy, and the construction very poor (e.g., little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose).  Also, it was a bit lopsided, so it did not sit squarely on my counter.  Maybe it works fine.  Who knows.  The design and manufacture were so poor, I didn't keep it long enough to find out 
 This "classic" text is best viewed as a quaint bit of history.  Many of the techniques have no realistic application in street combat (i.e., bayonet drill), and certain sections are best considered a mere novelty (i.e., knife throwing).  The advice on combat use of the Ka-Bar combat knife isn't that great -- the grips are weak, and the moves are based on fencing.  The sections on stickfighting and unarmed combat were the best parts of this popular book.  Not recommended for serious students of the fighting arts, but collectors of military books will like it 
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 A woman who lives in an apartment in NYC and can't cook and doesn't have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about. (She writes a very popular domestic advice column.) She succeeds, until a Navy hero wins the opportunity to spend Christmas with her in her house in Connecticut, enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby. Problem is, she doesn't have any of those things. She borrows the house (from a man who wants to marry her), she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house, and she even borrows a baby. The unmaking beings when she tells the Navy man her child is a boy, and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it's really a girl. Then the mother of the baby takes it back, and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one. Then the woman is falling in love with the Navy man (and he with her) while the man from whom she's borrowed the house still believes she's going to marry him, and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding.    It's a delightful movie. Very funny, and rich in both plot and character development.  Unfortunately, what probably makes it not a classic by today's standards, it is a bit plodding.  It does not move at the same pace as, for example, the movie Casablanca, with which it shares some of the same supporting actors 
 This was not a very good guidebook.  The directions were not always accurate and the maps (a very important part of a guide book) were not very good. The book is poorly organized, so that you are constantly having to page through to find information.  
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years.  It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered.  It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are  stereotypical creations of little or no interest.  I was particularly  amused when the detective was told to "make a few inquiries at the  transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the  corpse".  In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known  "transsexual shoe shop".  Please.  I suspect Ms. LaPlante has  better material, but this is a poor example better left unread.  I would  give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 I received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing. Boy, am I glad I didn't subscribe! The magazine is nothing but fluff - good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures - not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health.  
 I rated this book as 1 star because that's the least that's allowed by amazon. I picked up this book because it is supposed to be a Newyork times bestseller. Now I have realized that picking books that are so called bestsellers is no guarantee of a good read. The book is amateurish, silly, syrupy, incomplete, devoid of a plot, and has a sudden, miserable ending.  Three things left me puzzled and incredulous: 1. How could a respectable author submit this book as a completed work, 2. How could any publishing house worth it's name publish this pathetic piece of ineptitude, 3. How this apology of a book became a Newyork times bestseller 
 Musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers. This stuff wasn't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it. I like Mr.Asimov, and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery(maybe). All in all, read Benchley or Woody Allen again for literary laughs and leave Asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 The main reason to watch this flick is if you have a thing for gay male porno star of yesteryear, Tom Steele.  The leading guy looks just like him.  You see a lot less of this guy, if you catch my drift, but it's cute and watchable in a nostalgia kind of way if you remember seeing it on cable 20 years ago 
 Years ago, the trainer of my 3-months old coonhound recommended staying away from this book, describing it as "the best way to get your dog to be afraid of you and mess up your relationship forever!".  But I wanted to read it, to know what it was all about... I cannot tell you how many times I was fuming realizing how ignorantly these Monks approach dogs' psychology and the physical and psychological violence they use. The temptation of throwing that piece of junk out the window was strong, but I read it through to make sure I could talk about it as bad as I can with the knowledge of its contents. I am saddened to find out that they are still out there... This is the training philosophy for frustrated humans that need to dominate to compensate their own insecurities.  Meanwhile I am a trainer myself and I support a more constructive approach to dog training based on positive reinforcement.  If you know nothing about dogs' psychology, and want to learn more from "The Voice" in dog behavior I suggest "The Other End of the Leash" by Patricia McConnell or "Culture Clash"  by Jean Donaldson or "The Power of Positive Dog Training" by Pat Miller. If you would like to become a benevolent leader of the pack without imposing yourself to your dog with violence or fear, I suggest "How to be the Leader of the Pack...And have Your Dog Love You for It" ("How to" booklets from Dog's Best Friend) by Patricia B. McConnell. All these books are written by professionals that have been working with dogs and studying dogs' behaviors, but they are very entertaining and easy to read and comprehend. Patricia McConnell also wrote a number of other books addressing specific behavioral issues.   
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 ...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.   People say this is great music. Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me, and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird" music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears, try "Passengers" by U2.  And Thom York sings like a Muppet on this album.  By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people always busting its chops). 
 This book's strengths have been well stated.  It is a good read, and it conveys a feeling for combat in the Pacific that comes directly from Manchester's experience.  Or does it?  As only one reviewer has already noted, Manchester finally explains as an afterthought, where few will notice it, that most of what he writes about so vividly never really happened to him.  He confesses that the narrative "we" that he's employed throughout usually means (I'm paraphrasing) "other Marines not including me" !  This deception (or, if you prefer, "poetic licence") makes "Goodbye Darkness" a most peculiar combination of memoir, history, and, perhaps, an unknown amount of realistic fiction. What gives here?  And the subtitle is "A Memoir."  That's quite a stretch.  I feel cheated. 
 There is no point in buying this book if you have read Make the Connection.  Calling this a new book borders on fraud 
 What a lot of self-centered, pompous baloney!  McCort must have got his drinking buddies to write many of the deliriously exuberant rave reviews here.  Luckily I didn't pay a cent for this thing, which is still more than it's worth.  Library audio book.  Phooey 
 The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware! Canon, here I come! 
 Mike Mignola's comic books are great.  You should buy them instead of this overpriced collection of Mignola art.  The very thing that makes Hellboy so beautiful, the simplicity and elegance of design, means that looking at a Mignola sketch is exactly like looking at a finished comic book panel, except you can see the India ink brush marks in the black areas, and there is no supporting narrative thrust to give the picture meaning.  The same goes for his pencils (of which there are few included- I don't think this guy makes a mark on paper without inking and publishing it).  There is not even a discussion of Mignola's sources or inspirations, no bibliography of the occult (oh, I forgot, we're living in post-literate America).  There is no insight to be gained by investing in the Art of Hellboy, because it is just a sampler of beautifully designed panels that look better in the comic books 
 I am sorry to say that I thoroughly disliked "Of Human Bondage."  I know it is on every must read list for fiction (which is why I decided to read it) however, I just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature?  Not only did I find it dull but I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character's perception of women!  I'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways.  "Yellow teethed"  "Sallow skin"  "Dirty Hands"  "Tear stained over powdered face", it goes on and on.  I wondered if the author was uncomfortable women?  I looked online for some information about Maugham.  To my surprise I found out that Maugham was bisexual.  He did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. In no way can I say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern.    Instead of this book I'd recommend the following classics:  Beautiful and Damned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Madame Bovary by Flaubert.  At least in these books, maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.   
 Bart Ehrman's attack on Dan Brown's DaVinci Code raises as many questions as it answers, prompting a diligent student to write an attack on Ehrman's attack on Brown. Needless to say this might engender an infinite series of attacks on attacks, so caution is the best approach. Nonetheless, let's look at some of the errors that Ehrman commits while trying to give us the "truth and fiction" in the DaVinci Code. I'm focused on a single chapter (Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Marriage) to keep this review to a minimum.  Ehrman asserts that "most of Jesus' followers, and certainly his closest followers, were men (p. 145)."  We'd all agree with that, but before we take it for granted, you must consider that the gospels were written by men with an obvious bias against women, typical of the times. So it should be said in fairness that our impression that Jesus' most active followers were men comes from the stories told by men. In the rare case of a gospel by a women (the Gospel of Mary), for example, his closest adviser is a woman, not a man. Hence Ehrman's "history" may not reflect the "truth" but merely the opinion of the men.  Ehrman urges us to "recall the saying of Jesus preserved for us from Q...(p. 146)." Someone call the Press! Apparently Ehrman has discovered the Q document. That warrants a major press conference. I was under the impression that Q was a hypothetical document, but now Ehrman apparently is able to find sayings that have been preserved in it. This type of thinking is sloppy and doesn't belong in a serious book.  Ehrman uses a passage from Matthew (19:28) that says the disciples will be seated on 12 thrones to judge the 12 tribes and he concludes that "The future rulers of God's people would all be men (p. 146)." That would assume that all the disciples were men, which is by no means the clear case. It's rare for any of the gospels to give the names of all 12 disciples, and some gospels give the names of as few as 7. So who knows who the other 12 were. And certainly there are gospels which talk about Mary being a disciple, and she's not a man. So Ehrman's conclusion is faulty.  Ehrman claims "Of course there were not many Epicureans or Cynics in Jesus' immediate environment of Palestine... (p. 150)." Needless to say there is no citation for this assertion. That's because you probably couldn't find one. Cynics were known for their wandering, and it's hard to believe that there were not cynics visiting Sepphoris or Caesarea which were major cities, and Sepphoris was well within Jesus' "immediate environment." By the way, the word Palestine was adopted nearly 100 years after Jesus' death, so it's more than curious to find Ehrman talking about Jesus and Palestine.  Ehrman spends a lot of time questioning whether or not Jesus was married and he continually asks the question - "Why would his wife never be mentioned? (p. 153)" Apparently Ehrman has forgotten that the gospels were written by Christians who belonged to sects that were in competition with the sect that was represented by Jesus' family. It's for this reason that the writers slanted the gospels to paint the family in a negative light, as Jeffrey Butz has so brilliantly pointed out in his book The Brother of Jesus. If these same authors went to so much trouble to denigrate the brothers and sisters of Jesus, to what lengths would they have gone to remove any traces of his wife and children (Some scholars believe that the wedding at Cana is such a trace)? For if he had been married and had children, Christianity would have developed in a dramatically different way. While I am not arguing here that this is the case, any adequate discussion of the  situation surely must raise this possibility. Ehrman, however, for whatever reason, neglects to mention it.  Ehrman claims that "Magdalene indicates her place of origin - the town of Magdala... (p. 154)." Yes, that's one theory. But only one. And not a particularly good theory since it wasn't called Magdala anyway, but Magadan (Matthew 15:39), and it's hard to see how you go from Magadan to Magdalena. A better theory has been put forward by Margaret Starbird who believes that Migdal (the ancient name for the city, which means tower, becauser there was a fish tower there) refers to the fact that Mary "towered over" the other disciples. In other words, a nickname for "Mary the Great". Whether you subscribe to Starbird's theory or not, it deserves to be mentioned. But, in fact, it is in keeping with Jesus' tendency to give his disciples funky names (Rocky, the Brothers of Thunder, the Daggerman) rather than place names.  Ehrman claims "We do know of Jewish men from the time and place of Jesus who were single... (p. 155)" yet he fails to list a single one. Why? Because they are so few. It was inconceivable for a Jewish rabbi aged 30 in the 1st Century to be unmarried. William Phipp's excellent book Was Jesus Married provides good scholarship on this topic. Ehrman claims to have read it, but apparently he skipped that chapter.  Ehrman makes a school boy's error when he claims that the Essenes were celibate (p. 156). While it is true of one sect within the Essenes, there was another sect, noted by Josephus, who were married and allowed to reproduce.  These problems are not minor points. Yet even if they were, their sheer number is disturbing in a work that professes to separate "truth" from "fiction" in the works of another author. When Ehrman is working from such a self-exalted platform, it behooves him to insure that his own material is beyond reproach. This Ehrman does not do. 
 Will somebody tell Zakk Wylde he should hang himself?  That God-awful video for "In This River" is laying it on thick and pasty, just like a fresh laid stinky cow turd. His singing is a cross between Ozzy, Weiland's voice on "Crackerman" and Will Ferrell's character with voice immodulation syndrome.  After the 45th pinch harmonic and formulated chorus you will want to hurl your intestines out and then eat them like a dog, because your puked up intestines will go down more smoothly than trying to digest this disgrace to metal, music and the world.  I declare Jihad on BLS.  Give it up ZAKK...you SUKK 
 After seeing Feet of Flames, LOTD and Riverdance, other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions.    One of the main characters in the show, an older gent, walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he's pretty much a statue.  It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.  It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG.  You watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens.  The story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz.  No wonder it died financially and never reached the States 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 I know he's a famous "name-it-and-claim-it" preacher, so I wanted to see his thoughts exactly, rather than sit through some rambling sermons of his and get pieces here and there.  That's the great thing about books- preachers have to be concise and to the point.    I discovered he is teaching something I never heard before.  First, let me say that he acknowledges some truthful teachings.  He acknowledges that we are not to be greedy.  He acknowledges that Jesus said to store our treasure in heaven, not earth.  He acknowledges that there is nothing evil about money, but the "love of money" is what is evil (although, I think prosperity teachers like himself are deceived; they are in love with money, which is evident by seeing their lifestyles).  And, by the way, there is much in his book that is very good.  I only want to point out some of the dangerous errors.  And here it is:    He says that we are not to store treasure on earth, but in heaven.  That is true.  The Scripture says it.  But look at what he says that means.  He says that the storehouse for our treasure is in heaven, not the earth (not in banks).  When you need money, you can get it when you want, from God, from our heavenly storehouse.  There's no need to store it here (on earth), where robbers and thieves can get to it.      According to Copeland, how do you make deposits and withdrawals from this treasure bank in heaven?     From pages 63-75, he says how to make deposits.  These include (his words for the subheadings in this section):  -- Tithing (I this this is, by far, the most important) -- Giving to the Poor -- Investing in the Gospel -- Giving as a Praise to God    From pages 75-86 he explains how to make a withdrawal.  In the summary for making a withdrawal, he lists 6 points, culminating in a prayer that summarizes these points.  Here's his prayer from page 85-86:  "Father, in the Name of Jesus, we ask you for $____.  We have this money in our heavenly account and we are withdrawing this amount now.  We believe we receive $____.  As in Mark 11:23-24, we believe it in our hearts and confess now that it is ours in the Name of Jesus.  We agree that we have $____ according to Matthew 18:19.  From this day forward, we roll the care of this over on You and thank You for it.  Satan, in the name of Jesus, we take authority over you; we bind your operation now and render you helpless.  Ministering spirits, we charge you to go forth and cause this amount to come to us according to Hebrews 1;14.  Father, we praise Your Name for meeting our needs according to Your riches in glory by Christ Jesus and for multiplying our seed for sowing in the Name of Jesus."     I have just two questions for Pastor Kenneth Copeland:  1. Do you really live by these principles? Do you have a significant savings account and/or retirement bank account? According to your book, you shouldn't, if you really believed what you wrote.  2. Why didn't the first disciples and Apostles living in Jerusalem know this "secret" about heavenly "deposits" and "withdrawals?"  They were so poor and in hardship that the Apostle Paul went around making a special collection for them from the other Roman churches, as mentioned in 2 Cor. 8 and other passages.  In fact, why didn't any other theologians ever teach this heavenly deposit and withdrawal system?  Shouldn't that be a hint to you that you are going off into the deep end???!!!

 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 I looked forward to this book but found it sorely lacking.  My biggest gripe is that the brothers jump in a few pages from their modest upbringing to b ig shot dealers wheeling and dealing million(s) dollars items,  There is no discussion of how this jump was made, or how they could manage to finance the huge purchase prices they describe.  Further the books deals in antiques that only the top .00001 percent of the population could actually buy.  Nor is there anything about the business end of things, like how one becomes a top line dealer.  Instead of focusing on real tips and experiences acquiring items that a serious (middle class) collector could hope to acquire, they focus on items that most millionaires would find expensive.  Don't expect this book to have any relevancy to you 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 Was really disappointed with this album. He needs to find something new that has the zip of Vincent, Crying  & American Pie. Old artists may need to just fade away if they are just a bunch of old men strumming boring new stuff. Bought this album because of the 3 songs that I mentioned. None of the rest made me want to listen more than once. 
 Buy this book at your peril. The author of this book has, it would appear, done alot of research and he wants you to know it. The book is difficult and language laborious. This might be an ok read for advanced sociologist but for your average computing proffessional or student of computing its a  waste of time 
 I have never purchased such a bunch of crap in my life.  This is the got to be the worst "Man's guide" I have ever read.  This guy has got no game to speak of and his best advice is to not drive 60 miles out of your way and get husstled out of a bunch of money by some chick.  Duh!!! [... 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Cuisinart's ad copy and product directions claim that the charger can be kept plugged into the wall so it's always ready for use.  However, this is a nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery.  Plugging it back in to recharge before you've fully drained it is DEATH to NiCad batteries!   This stupid design decision on the part of Cuisinart almost guarantees a poor user experience

 The ideal exegete in the also ideal Sola Scriptura traditio is one that leads the Holy Text in the original greek take him wherever it leads him, just like Jesus inviting us to deny ourselves and follow him. According to the calvinist ideal (see the Westminster Confession) the Bible in the original languages is the ultimate judge. Thiselton is a good exegete but when it comes to certain verses that uncover the anti biblical side of  his calvinist tradition, Thiselton with all the naturality simply gives us his calvinist translation, and even tough he says that "linguistics and semantics has to have the control". A crystal clear example is 1 Cor 6:9-10. "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God".   In this verses Paul says clearly that if we, christians, commit adultery, drunkness etc we won`t inherit the Kingdom of God. Paul uses the crucial phrase "inherit the Kingdom" using twice the verb "inherit" in the future, once before the list of vices and once more at the end of it. With this verse it is obvious that a christian, a real one can lose salvation and justification and Paul reinforces this writing "Don`t deceive yourselves" (See also Eph 5:5). What Thiselton does is: 1) Telling us that Paul has his own "grammar" Thiselton translates the first "inherit" using the present time, instead of the future as the greek demands in order to save the calvinist "perseverance of the saints" doctrine. The calvinist doctrine that Thiselton follows teaches that when the Bible talks about judgment is talking about the genuiness of the person judged, is he or she real christian or not.  Thiselton tells us that the inherit concept in the Bible has present and future implications, and he wants to shift our attention from the future judgment, to the present (are you a real christian). But the one who has to tells us when God is talking about the future implication of the "inherit" concept is the Sacred Author. A good exegete follows the greek text, Thiselton changes the future for the present, pointing to a differente direction than Paul the Apostles.   The real grammar Thiselton follows is not "Paul`s grammar", and he admits that he is not following greek grammar in 1 Cor 6:9. He is following Calvin`s grammar. Yes, he talks about "new hermeneutics" but he writes as an old fashion good calvinist and sometimes zwinglian exegete.  His treatment of the Eucharistic texts of First Corinthians reveals once more that he is following Calvin or Zwingli, but it is a real joy when he comments 1 Corinthians 11:29-30  "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep". All Thiselton`s calvinist or zwinglian interpretation shatters when he comments this verse, verse 30. Correct me, but Thiselton just quotes 2 fathers of the church when he treats the eucharistic sections of First Corinthians, Augustine, and Ignatius. This says so much about this commentary .   This commentary is a good one (I love his treatment about the so called Spirit Baptism), but remember Thiselton is calvinist and he is not Matthew Henry, also a calvinist, but one that had the honesty to follow the truth even when the Bible took him away from Calvin`s errors.   
 Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters).  I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels.  Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book.     What a let down!!!    OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book.  Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so.  Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the "wrap up", but there was no basis to it.  I came to the last page and thought  THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me.  
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Read the recommendations on the cover carefully. They are ALL for the author, NOT the book. There are good reasons the book is not recommended. It is not based upon research or even extensive personal experience with addicts. It is simply some off the cuff remarks by a famous person who does not understand addiction. I agree spirituality is the cornerstone of recovery and joy is needed, but it is not as simple as the author implies. His emphasis on psychoanalytic understanding of addiction is very outdated and has not led effective treatment 
 This is a maddening book.  Roughly half consists of facts (I assume - no citations) concerning writers and other creative artists, some of them wonderful.  Another quarter states, usually without comment, the causes of death for such artists.  And the final quarter consists of spare comments (often just a sentence fragment)on themes of life and death, meant to invoke pity and awe but instead remindful of "Deep Thoughts" written somewhat in the manner of the Cantos, phony and inflated.  Imagine something like: "Sophocles. Dante. Heine.  Djuna Barnes.  Writer." (referring to himself) 
 Thank god I bought this used! I'd heard a couple of Hank Jr. late 70's cds, and thought I'd check out his whole career. What a mistake! He peaked out early, with "Wiskey Bent and Hell Bound". Don't bother after that, unless you just want redneck party music, with no depth and no originality. Bad country-rock covers of ZZ Top, Aerosmith, etc, and those are the high points 
 I love Lee.  I mean his stuff is just so much fun.  When I finally gave him a chance and started reading his stuff I was hooked.  Then I read Flesh Gothic and while good it just was not quite as good as the others I had read.  I could not call what I felt disappointment but it was like a bump in the road.  Then I read the Messenger.  This is the worst I have read from Lee.  It contained none of the fun of his other novels.  Stay away from this one.  
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I will never purchase another Neutrogena product, again.  There products are dangerous!!!  It burned my face.  My face is all red, swollen, red, irritated, and itchy.  My new best friend is Cortizone 10, the anti itch cream.  It's been a week since I stopped using Netrogena, and I still look horrifying!!!!  Perfect for Halloween, right?  But, Halloween is over, and I still look scary.  This product has aged me!!!  It has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen.  NEVER, AGAIN, NEUTROGENA!!! 
 Cons only, no pros: the velcro closure is week and opens easily terrible look the side zippers are a mistery, totally useless no space for extra memory or battery attaches only to a very small belt the flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash 
 I bought this book after reading the other two excellent reviews. Well, it was a big waste of money for me. The book was not written in a clear, easy to follow manner. It should be rewritten in half the number of pages. Rather go for "From Science to God" by Peter Russell 
 This book is certainly heavy on the eye-candy - it has lots of great pictures (though perhaps dated... very late-80's hair styles) and nice listings describing the colleges and whatnot. If you're looking for something that gives a feel for the look of the place (or at least the look on nice early-summer days when all the students are wearing their gowns), this is a lovely place to look.  Unfortunately, glaring factual errors and odd 'stereotypes' really detracted from the quality of this guide. Included is a brief summary of the Oxford colleges. Unfortunately, many are left out (seemingly at random - the maps also leave out several important sites while including other entirely mundane ones) and the descriptions of others are factually quite incorrect (and sometimes contradictory - All Souls is described as being the only graduate college [it is not a graduate college], then Nuffield is also described as being a graduate college [it is]). There are also odd little tidbits of information that seem to represent a story of the colleges frozen sometime in the past (and not a nifty 1920's past - presumably the late 1980's or early '90's when the first edition was published) - 'excellent darts team?' ok, so they may have once, but that's rather useless information today. My own college's description, though quite pleasant, is not a very good representation of the place today. Some of the college descriptions are also really just mean, representing some undefined antipathy on the part of the author (did someone from that college steal his girlfriend or something?).  Overall, it's a very pretty publication that certainly had a very good team of photographers and graphic designers, but as it's not so strong on the facts and could do with some updates - Oxford isn't as unchanging as it may seem 
 I read the other review about this book. I dont understand how reader enjoy the book. its boring, many twisted plots is unnessery, the end is little surpising but not convincing at all. I read the book 10 days and I just wait to see where the book will become interesting- its not happen. I never feel so boring in reading a book. This is my second book of deaver. I read the vanished man and I very enjoy but this book was inferior.  Maybe one thing in the book was enjoyable and this is the descriptions of Deaver- like the description of the childhood of  Hrubek and of Lis- this was touching and maybe this give me the fews moments of enjoy in the book 
 I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it? 
 Buy the same exact EP online from the artist's record label (Sub Pop) for far less money than Amazon wants for it. What a rip-off!! 
 Harper's Bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine, but I wish now that I had never gotten a subscription. True, each issue would be more expensive, but  1) I could pick out what issues seemed worth buying, as some are thin and empty  2) They are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue. I have only gotten one issue on time, to be honest. 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 This is a great magazine, but don't order it through Amazon.  They go through a third party (Snapse Magazine)that has terrible customer service.  I ordered this magazine in January and SIX months later... still no magazine.  I called Snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order (even though I received an email confirmation from Amazon and I have a 17 digit confirmation number).  They said they would research it and get back to me.  No one called or emailed me the status, so two weeks later I called them again.  They acted as if I had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue. I won't get my first issue until August.  Buyer beware... it could take SEVEN MONTHS before you receive your FIRST ISSUE.  
 A Critical Response to Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America       Since I began intensively studying the Israel-Palestine conflict nine years ago, I have (as a Jew) also been concerned with its historical and current effect on relations among blacks and Jews in this country. These relations have reflected the influence that neoconservatism, originating primarily among Jewish intellectuals, has had on mainstream (liberal) Jewish institutional life and political culture in America, and the manner in which Jewish-identified aspects of neoconservatism (opposition to affirmative action, support for Israel, an obsession with alleged anti-Semitism and now "Islamo-fascism") have been adopted by a broader culture of white racism and class privilege, with obvious dire effects both domestically and globally. What began as one aspect of the white ethnic intellectual backlash in the 1960s has evolved, been appropriated, and become central to the domestically ruthless and globally violent ideology of the current administration, with a concurrent black-Jewish subplot that has been much discussed but not adequately understood.  	It is in this context that I was intrigued to discover a massive 527-page work of scholarship called Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America by UCLA English professor Eric Sundquist (Belknap-Harvard, 2005). Upon obtaining this book, however, I was quickly disappointed to find-in spite of many insightful analyses of literary works-a clear unwillingness to seriously engage the central issues noted above. While I will leave it to others to judge whether Strangers in the Land succeeds as a work of cultural/literary criticism, I would suggest that it is an utter and insidious failure of political criticism. Moreover, I think that it is as a work of political criticism that it will be (and should be) primarily received. As such, this book stands as an apology for neoconservatism and its support for white privilege in America, as well as its support for the Zionist project in all its aggressive criminality, now coming to a head as any possibility of viable Palestinian state is being destroyed. In this context, Sundquist shows a marked lack of compassion for the dire plight of the Palestinian people, and-given his obviously considerable scholarly skills-demonstrates a seemingly willful innocence of the implications of historical scholarship, human rights reports, and diplomatic records now freely available, most recently summarized by Norman Finkelstein.  	In summary, Sundquist views neoconservatism as rather benignly emanating in the 1960s from liberal Jewish intellectuals understandably caught amongst a dedication to the meritocracy, Jewish group interests, and the threatening demands of what he sees as anti-Zionist and incipiently anti-Semitic advocates of Black Power. Sundquist reduces Black Nationalist, Black Power, Pan-African, and Third World Liberation movements, and specifically the leadership of Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, to demagogic, venal, anti-Semitic opportunism and bigotry. Sundquist adopts a boilerplate Zionist narrative of the history of Palestine and Israel that would not pass muster in any college classroom worth its name, which romanticizes Israelis and denigrates Palestinians. While maintaining a scholarly tone and engaging in prodigious amounts of research, Sundquist ultimately refuses to seriously engage the critical scholarship which he references, from the work on Jewish whiteness of his UCLA colleague Karen Brodkin, to Manning Marable's careful scholarship on African-American political movements, to the new Israeli historians, and to Edward Said and Rashid Khalidi.  	All this is done in the framework of a purportedly unbiased treatment of Black-Jewish relations.  But two examples will be quoted of Sundquist's peculiarly jaundiced notion of "balance" in his treatment of black-Jewish and Israeli-Palestinian issues:  "(Meir) Kahane's views were all the more remarkable for being borrowed from the same black nationalism the JDL (Jewish Defense League) meant to oppose. The paperback jacket of Kahane's "Never Again!," an exposition of JDL militancy, rightly compared the book to Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" and "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." The JDL's symbol, a clenched fist issuing from a Star of David, mirrored the clenched fist of Black Power. Consciously styling themselves "Jewish Panthers," members undertook armed community patrols...Underscoring the parallel, Kahane declared that the JDL did not differ from the Panthers in wanting to instill self-assurance and pride in young people..."  In the face of Black Power's demand that Jews acquiesce to policies inimical to their own interests, and wary of their precarious position in a nation still for the most part ruled by a Protestant elite, many Jews may well have felt hemmed in by the "politics of powerlessness." "(p. 357-59)  	This passage is reflective of Sundquist's tone throughout the relevant sections of the book: blacks threaten innocent Jews, who do not partake in the racism of other whites, and just want a "color-blind" society based on merit. Some Jews understandably react negatively to black betrayal. Black Power-the basis of this betrayal-was an insidious force sui generis, and a corruption of Martin Luther King's movement which was supported by most Jews. Some Jews have of course over-reacted. But Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X are to be equated (or worse) to Meir Kahane, and Kahane was simply reacting to their provocations. These black leaders-viewed by Sundquist as stereotypes of threatening black males rather than evolving socialist revolutionary political leaders, are more deserving of harsh criticism and dismissal than someone who immigrated to Israel to lead the most vicious and openly racist aspect of the Jewish settler movement.       "Whether or not the massacre (at Deir Yassin in April, 1948, during which Zionist forces led by Menachem Begin killed 100 Palestinian villagers, including old men, women, and children) was intended-at least some dimension of it, such as killing all the men of the village apparently had been discussed-remains a vexed question. ...Whatever the explanation for the killings at Deir Yassin, there is little doubt that the Palestinian Jews, soon to be Israelis, used the threat of other Deir Yassins, coupled with less fearsome raids on individual villages, as psychological warfare. If the killings led to wild rumors about Jewish determination to exterminate Arabs, however, such rumors were made credible less because of the way Jews conceived of the war than because of the way a number of Arabs did. Ahmed Shukeiry, aide to the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, envisioned "the elimination of the Jewish state," while Abd al-Rahman Azzam Pasha, the secretary general of the Arab League, looked forward to "a war of extermination and momentous massacre" and declared that "it does not matter how many (Jews) there are. We will sweep them into the sea." Joined with other factors-the early flight of the wealthy elite, Arab calls for women and children to evacuate, and the dissolution of Palestinian military leadership-fears that Israelis were bent on waging such a war, a mirror image of the declarations of Arab leaders, were a decisive factor in the momentous outflow of Arab refugees in the months to come. Responding to concerted attacks by five Arab nations bent on destroying the Jewish state, Israel captured some 30 percent more territory than it had been granted by the United Nations. With the exodus of the Arabs, a Jewish majority was created. So too, the "Palestinian problem," the approximately 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in Palestine, most expecting to return after Arab nations had driven out the Jews ... " (p. 374-375)  	This virtually propagandistic obfuscation is typical of Sundquist's treatment of Israel and Palestine throughout his historical account, from 1948 to 1967 to 1973, with Israel's survival always assumed to be at stake from hateful Arab nations. The most significant and brutal Jewish massacre of Arabs is buried in a sea of equivocation (including a veiled reference to the myth of "Arab broadcasts") in a selective and distorted historical context-without regard, for example, to what is now known about Zionist plans for transfer (carried out before and after Deir Yassin), collusion between Zionist leaders and the leader of Trans-Jordan (Emir Abdullah) to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state, or the tepidness of Arab intervention, arguably not a serious threat to the nascent but already well-armed Jewish state. Again, in spite of the Sundquist's references to new Israeli historians like Avi Shlaim and to Rashid Khalidi, he seems unwilling to seriously address the implications of what is now conventional scholarly wisdom, which well explains the ongoing destruction of Palestinian national aspirations.       In his narrative context, both American and Israeli Jews-including the worst sorts of neoconservatives and Likudniks (although not always clearly distinguishable from liberals and Laborites)-maintain an essential innocence and humanity; black Americans and Palestinians, on the other hand, are seen as easily manipulated by the demagogic appeals of their leaders, who ultimately undermine whatever legitimate aspirations their followers might have, which can best be served (according to Sundquist) by traditional liberal activism (as defined by Jews). In tracing what he sees as the naïve and unwarranted affinity of black nationalists for the Palestinian cause, Sundquist casts aspersions on third world liberation movements as antithetical to the centrist, domestic liberalism with which he, and in his view most Jews, rightly identify. African-Americans, according to Sundquist, have been betrayed by their leaders, whose criticism of Jews is self-serving and impractical at best, and anti-Semitic and violent at worst. Ultimately, Sundquist collapses James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael onto Louis Farrakhan, Leonard Jeffries, and Tony Martin.       At bottom, Strangers in the Land fails as a work of political criticism not only due to a careless rendering of reality in the Middle East, but due to an unwillingness to entertain the notion of a peculiarly Jewish intellectual and ideological contribution to white racism and the maintenance of white privilege in this country, including the projection of racist attitudes onto the Israel-Palestine conflict, and onto western relations with the Arab and Muslim worlds. While the notion of Jewish racism is absent from this book (as if the experience of discrimination and the Holocaust makes such a thing unthinkable and impossible), an indigenous anti-Semitism is assumed to be long-standing, central, and substantial in African-American culture. Sundquist has thus written a book that accepts the basic assumptions of neoconservative ideology, with all of the racist baggage that that implies at home and abroad. In these narrative confines, there is no objective place to stand from which to understand the peculiarly Jewish-American contribution to this ideology, and to propose a new interpretation of Black-Jewish relations based at least partly on Jewish self-criticism, including criticism of what has turned out to be a morally and politically disastrous Jewish state.  
 I have read over a dozen instructional books on racing, and this is easily the worst.  It doesn't ever get specific enough about the lessons it tries to teach, and even though I was familiar with every subject it covered, I was still confused by some of their descriptions.  I believe an experienced and educated racer will find this book too elementary, and the beginning racer won't understand that they aren't being taught the whole lesson, and their driving will suffer.  Start with Watts' "Secrets of Solo Racing", which has very relevant and helpful diagrams (unlike this book) and go from there.  You will be a better driver for it.   
 Can someone seriously explain how and why Betty Hutton became a star?  Her one talent seems to be her volume.  She is entirely without subtlety, sincerity, honesty in her acting and is a mediocre singer.  She merely shouts.  The production numbers are well done and Howard Keel does well, especially since he is playing opposite a fire engine siren.  
 The first books by John Ringo were gripping tales of interstellar war and invasion, liberally laced with what he himself calls carnography. By the time his third book was published though, he seems to have learned the all too common skill of filling pages without providing any content.  "The Hero" tries to tell the story of a military special operations team a thousand years in the future. All the characters are totally forgettable, and indeed the authors proceeds to kill most of them off quickly enough. The story consists of the teams travails slogging around a hostile countryside playing Blind Man's Bluff, while some of the members try to kill each other. The situations are arbitrary and meaningless. The authors introduce strange fauna, and then mostly ignore them except when convenient. The equipment carried by the soldiers is shockingly primitive for a culture with a millennium of uninterrupted technical civilization.  The only minor points of interest are that Ringo finally includes the English pronunciation of his Bane Sidhe (for those who hadn't figured it out), we learn a little (very little) about the Aldenata, and there is confirmation that the Posleen were bioengineered, like that's a surprise 
 This is nothing more than a owners manual. If you bought a new computer it came with one, read it .... It didnt answer 1 thing I wanted to know. Most of the things in this book I have done and I didnt even read my owners manual. If you were given "just" a computer with XP on it and you knew "nothing" about a computer, this would be an OK book 
 Thankfully, Abigail Thomas followed the proverb, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again," having recently composed a wonderful memoir of life before, during and (mostly) after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury, entitled A Three Dog Life. Unfortunately, this earlier work, a 179-page collection of about 100 stories, ranging in length from one sentence to a few pages, was disappointing. In Safekeeping, snippets of her life from an eighteen-year-old pregnant wife, to grandmotherhood, her writing feels stiff and forced and even though I disliked it from the start, I trudged on hopefully. Unfortunately, my disappointment never disappeared and only wavered during two of the stories, I Ate There Once, about a conversation which takes place as she rides in a car with her second and third husbands and, What the Moment Can Hold, which tells of her feelings and actions during an encounter with her newborn granddaughter. Both felt authentic and true. As far as the rest of the stories, they seemed like what you'd get from an above-average college student if you assigned them to create a journal of life, specifying, "Write down any random thought you have." Additionally, it is written in the third person, which doesn't suit the theme, memoir-like "true stories from a life." Readers should skip Safekeeping in favor of her later and many-times-better memoir, A Three Dog Life 
 I ordered this book, and thought I would not have to read the text, but I was unprepared for the class.  I also did not need the busy-work portions of the book 
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 Okay, I've been greatly amused at Jack Thompson's rantings against the gaming industry online.  I saw this book advertised, but never thought I'd actually purchase it.  But last week, I found it on the shelf of the local Salvation Army!  So I snagged it.  All in all, I wish I hadn't bothered.    Thompson's writing is disjointed, and more than a little self-congratulatory.  He uses the old, timeworn ruse of `being forced' to convert to a conservative position due the pressures of society.  Much like how a radical Christian may claim to have once been a bad old drug addict, Atheist, or gang member, Thompson claims to have been liberal, open minded, and against limits to free speech.    Thompson was `shocked' into action against free speech, so he says, in a battle against a Florida radio personality, which he claims to have won.  Thompson offers no proof that such a battle actually took place, nor does he reference the outcome.  This sort of writing is typical of they way he provides `facts' throughout his book.  By the time I got halfway through this book, I didn't know whether to laugh, or throw up.  Saying that his tone is `strident' would be kind.  Dangerously insane would be closer to reality.  I'll admit I didn't finish this book.  It was just too much torture.  I'm considering the two dollars that I paid for this book a `donation' to the Salvation Army, because I feel like I was ripped off if I think of it as the purchase price for Thompson's book 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 first, i'm a painter myself, and a huge fan of sargent's work. in this book, however, the image quality isn't bad, and the color is close to accurate, but some of the luminoscity in color and contrast are lost. most of the images appear washed out and dull. the portrait on page 577 is a HORRIBLE photo. the art institute of chicago owns this painting, and having been a student there, i've spent hours studying this piece in person. the color os horribly grayed out in the photo, a lot of detail is lost, the painting appears to be a mess of paint rather than precisely carved out shapes (which is what made sargent so excellent). this is a landscape, but it doesn't seem to be painted outside in the photo! this is one of sargents greatest pieces, in my opinion, and the photo of the painting was completely butchered.   most other photos aren't this bad, but you must keep in mind that most of the paintings in this book are printed only half or a quarter of the page. everything just appears so shrunken, you can't observe the detail.   that being said, if you are a huge fan of sargent, an art historian, or for any other reason you want at your hand every single piece he's done, this would be a necessary addition. it's not a complete waste of money, i just don't think it is worth more than $25 or so. though, it IS the only book like this published thus far.   also, upon my first flip-through of the book, once i got to the last page, i realized my last page tore from the cover & the binding is exposed. i ordered this book brand new from amazon, so even though i can easily re-glue the binding together, it makes me feel the quality of this book is actually very low and cheap.   unfortunately, i spent an additional $100 on the other two volumes to this collection, and they have yet to arrive. hopefully they won't be as disappointing as this one. 
 I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon.  It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections.  the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
 Pasquale Scaturro and Gordon Brown make the first "source to sea" expedition down the Nile. It is a splendid adventure that would make a great story. Unfortunately, the author spends nearly a third of the pages interjecting musings from himself (he wasn't there) and boring the reader with sideline stories that that have little if any connection with the current expedition. Just as the reader gets swept up in the adventure, the author interupts the scene with some left field factoid and destroys any sense of cadence. It's almost as bad as being in the grip of a televised Olympic event and having it interrupted by an inane story about the father of one of the athletes.  The author, Richard Bangs, wasn't on the trip but writes an almost first person narrative based on interviews with Scaturro and assorted other people. Inexplicably, he doesn't interview Gordon Brown who comprised a full 50% of the expedition. Instead he castigates Brown at every turn for being moody, violent, "silent for days", self-absorbed, etc., etc. At no point does the author offer any explanation why Brown might be behaving the way he does. The reader is left wondering why and a simple over-the-phone interview of Brown would have answered these questions.   In the final chapters Bangs decides (again, without talking to Brown) that Brown's anti-social behavior is linked to a brain cancer that has long-since been cured. Not only is it a convenient way for Bangs to avoid doing his homework and writing a definitive documentary; it's a blatantly cheap shot at Brown and any other person who has been challenged with a handicap - temporary or not.   This is a wonderful adventure that deserves an honest, accurate, and well rounded accounting by a first rate author who isn't afraid to dig for details and doesn't have some personal axe to grind 
 This book is long on formula derivation, and short on DOE theory.  It does not introduce readers to DOE software packages like it claims either.    Also, very poor on real life examples.  They exist....but not enough details in order to understand them.  I am looking to teach a corporate class on this....too bad the book doesn't come with the professor.  
 I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad poetry from a twisted man 
 I agree completely with D.Tjoa's review.  I bought it because of Amazon's 'If you like David Sedaris,...', but this is not humor writing.  Short stories yes, but if there is humor it is very dark and I couldn't find it.  Even irony would have been acceptable...  I'll define it as odd and mostly depressing 
 Crikey!!!! What is this chunder? Wait a minute....art students from "Down Under" get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of "The Wiggles", decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base! Yeah, this stuff could be the soundtrack to "Forrest Gump" alright. "Run, Forrest, run! Run as fast as you can from this crap!!!" And these guys are touring, too? Are they touring with Barney & Friends?  There is not one thing of value to this other than that the CD itself makes a handy coaster for your Foster's.. 
 I've never given one star to any type of produce before, but the stupidity of this DVD and its fans are shocking.  So revealing!  So true!  If you didn't know fast food was unhealthy, give me a break.  If you think this is realistic, give me a break.  "Supersize Me" is a piece of propaganda meant to turn people away from eating McDonalds food.  The film documents Morgan Spurlock embarking on a perilous quest to eat three meals of McDonalds per day.  This diet has rules too.  Whenever he is asked if he wants a meal to be Super-Sized, he must do it.  He also much try each item on the menu at least once.  He is only allowed to consume items that are in fact on the menu.  The thing is though, if he is really trying to make a valid point, why does he order the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal twice within the first seven days?  This is questionable, because not only is this the most fatty item on the menu, it also made him vomit the first time that he ate it all.  The thing is though, millions of people (some skinner than Spurlock) have this meal and do not throw up.  Why him?  His wife is a vegan chef and he is used to having no meat in his diet.  So why would he choose the biggest item on the menu TWICE in the first week?  There are many, many other items that he couldn't possibly been able to cover.  Not only that, he almost gets no exercise during the month of this experiment, saying that the average American gets little exercise.  His laziness seems to be an exaggeration.  There is some merit to the movie, showing people how unhealthy McDonalds is, but everyone knows that.  They just don't care.  For Spurlock to in any way (even the subtlest of ways) to support the idiots who sue the fast food chains because they became obese, is ludicrous.  It should be mentioned that Wendy's regular hamburger is a quarter pounder, while McDonalds regular burger is 1/10th of a pound.  Also, Wendy's goes up to a triple quarter pounder, something McDonalds has never done.  Burger King introduced the triple cheese burger and QUADROUPLE cheese burger, something McDonalds has never done.  It seems that McDonalds is picked as a scapegoat because it is the most popular.  This movie may have been more credible if it examined the dangers of fast food as a whole, but just to go up against the one corporation is stupid.  If the movie didn't suggest that the corporation doesn't care about it's customers, I wouldn't have a problem, but it does.  Too much of anything, especially food, is bad for someone.  If anyone needed a movie to tell them that fast food is unhealthy, they clearly are seeing the world through a filter.  1/1 
 THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THIS PUBLISHERS EDITION NOT ABOUT THE BOOKS CONTENT ITSELF.  If you want to know about the content--- be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free, online, if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about. I am a person who prefers a real, bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper.  I learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the Charlotte Mason method.  This book weaves science content into a story format (narrative format).  About this edition of the book--buyer beware!  I am very annoyed. I saw that Amazon sells three different publishers' versions of reprints of this very old book, before I purchased the book from Amazon.  Of course I am mad at myself for making a mistake, but I am also not happy with the way Amazon markets this Kessinger Publishing's version of this book.  I have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read. I took time to research this. I wanted whichever publisher's version has a readable font that is clearly printed.  The way Amazon presently has this item (book reprinted by Kessinger Publishing) set up on their webpage, I thought I was looking inside this book. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible! I can't stand to read this! Upon double checking this now, I see I made a simple mistake--if you don't want to make the same mistake that I made please read on...  It appears that this Kessinger Publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original. The old font type is hard to read. But the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven. Specifically, I mean that some parts of the letters are missing (there is white space) while others are blobbed so that the letters don't look as they should, they are black blobs in some parts. I would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible. A modern font is also usually easier on the eyes.  I am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print! Come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font!  I am upset with Amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to "look inside this book" brings you to the edition published by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" which has what looks to be a great font, a nice, clear, modern font and a good printing job. (Also today I received a different book purchased from Amazon by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot.  I will be returning this book to Amazon. Too bad I have to pay the shipping to return it to them! 
 Who published these weak translations?  Yup, they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately.  How about using real paper?  B&N needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality 
 I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!!  In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.   Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin 
 I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.    I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably 
 I'm an avid reader and usually really enjoy chick-lit as a fun, escapist read. I expected to really enjoy this book. I don't know if it is because I tried reading it while pregnant myself, but I just could not identify with this character. In fact, this is one of only two books I've ever just not been able to get through. I found the main character annoying, ridiculous and just plain shallow. I mean, if the author had found some really compelling reason for the main character to fake her pregnancy (which maybe she did, but not in the first 1/4 of the book), I might have liked her. But instead the main character just seemed shallow and I just couldn't root for her, or even continue reading about her. Too bad, the premise seemed like it could have made for a really fun and funny read 
 This book is primarily, in my view, a male bashing book, with some admittedly interesting side comments about the clitoris. As a male human I am intrigued by the clitoris & would love to learn more about it. However the author of this book sems to, in my view, hate men & maleness so much, that she wants to keep men from reading her book & enjoying it via inappropriate overgeneralizations & male bashing. Can human females in western culture only enjoy their sexuality at the expense of all human men? I hope not 
 For good or for ill I recently was asked to help pick out graphic novels for children of my library system.  I suspect I was asked this partly because I am under the age of 30 and partly because my brother-in-law is a comic book inker.  The upside is that I get to see lots and lots of new titles for kids.  The down side is that more often than not they're truly terrible.  I mean just awful stuff.  Now recently Scholastic has been trying to corner the market on quality graphic novels for children. Somehow they missed the "Babymouse" boat, but they've already given us "Bone" and "The Baby-Sitters Club" series.  It's not all good all the time though.  Recently a co-worker threw a series title, "The Black Belt Club" onto my desk and asked me to read it through.  I had no idea when I read this book just how heavily Scholastic was riding on it.  Already the first book in the series (this is the second) has been optioned for a film.  Go to the book's website and you'll learn about their hopes for an animated series, video games, the whole nine yards.  There's just one catch.  Unless the books become mighty popular, there won't be much point to all the hyping.  And reading it through I have no idea if kids are gonna go in for its "prose and comic hybrid" style or not.   	 Max has never felt completely at ease as a member of the exclusive Black Belt Club.  The club consists of four students who are sent by their sensei into the world to fight evil.  Pretty standard stuff.  After a disappointing demo team performance he returns to the dojo for a special assignment with his fellows.  There they are told by a mysterious magical Native American woman named Grandmother Dancing Feather that there's been an imbalance between the four elements in the world.  It's up to the kids to defeat The Hate Master (honestly, that's his name) and get the elements back in alignment.  Along the way, Max has to face up to his fears as well as his own sorrows.  But it's only through friendship that the four can join together and defeat their enemy once and for all.  The book is a combination of written prose and graphic novel elements.  In a way, Scholastic is banking on this series to be a kind of link between straight out comic books and straight out literature.  Like "Captain Underpants", this is supposed to bridge the gap.  The funny thing is, Scholastic keeps referring to this series as the "first ever prose and comic hybrid".  It says this on the book's webpage.  Now this is where it gets funny.  "Captain Underpants" came up with this style way way before Barnes ever did.  And "Captain Underpants" is produced by Blue Sky Press which is an imprint of... Scholastic, Inc!  So if Scholastic already has the real "hybrid" credited to their name, what the heck are they doing foisting credit to "The Black Belt Club" books?  Just weird.  Anyway, what was I saying?  Ah yes.  This new technique.  Well, insofar as it goes, it works.  The problem is not in the style but in the writing.  THAT, unfortunately, is where it begins to fall apart. 	 Since the first book, Barnes has kicked up the emotional conflict.  Her hero Max still has self-esteem issues and he sometimes doubts whether or not the three other members of the club are really his friends (a legitimate concern).  There's also an odd backstory where Max is taken care of by his gruff karate-hating uncle because his father is so often away on business.  None of that is really resolved in this book, however.  Apparently by the end Max has discovered that, "There was nothing better in the whole wide world than having friends!".  Also that, "love is stronger than hate".  No real innovation or new ideas here.  Barnes is perfectly content to rely on old overused phrases like these, when even a simple rewording could have conveyed the same thoughts without seeming overly trite.  And that, unfortunately, is the problem with this series itself.  It's just too simplistic.  There's lots of fancy action sequences, and the parts with Max on his own are fine, but the moralistic tone is more than a little preachy and self-serving.   	 Then there are the weird elements.  In this particular book, the kids are visited by a magical old Native American woman named Grandmother Dancing Feather.  What tribe is she with?  It apparently doesn't matter.  What does matter is that she represents a kind of condensed be-one-with-the-world combination of every pseudo-Native American teaching out there.  In the back of the book we're told that Dawn Barnes did some "personal studies" with a Seneca Shaman and a Ute Shaman.  She then takes the very very vague notion of "interconnectedness between themselves [i.e. children] and other living beings" and smooshes it into one big mess.  It's not that such ideas aren't legitimate.  It's that she's watered and dumbed them down in what she obviously thought was a kid-friendly fashion.  Then she takes the rather offensive route of having a magical person of another ethnicity guide the kids.  Even EVEN if Barnes had said that the villain was a coyote (which apparently he is) and then explained who coyote was to some Native American tribes THEN she might have tied together a legitimate myth with her video-gamelike storyline.  Instead she doesn't seem to want to spoil her tale with anything with that much depth.  Pah.   	 The plot of the book is taken directly from Barnes's belief in a teaching style she has dubbed, "positive dialogue response".  A November 1, 2005 issue of Entrepreneur said that this meant, "motivating children with praise rather than fear".  Therefore fear is bad in her books.  Anger's bad too.  Part of the problem with the book is that Barnes equates anger with hate, making both out to be bad.  I'm all for the "hate is bad" part, but anger has a real use in this world.  It can be used to fight injustice, for example.  Blas people, for all their charms, won't go fighting for what is right if they don't feel angry with the situation at hand.  Barnes doesn't quite acknowledge this and the book suffers. 	 Now Dawn Barnes (who bears a truly frightening resemblance to the Sensei featured in the books) has the credentials to pen this kind of "novel with action graphics".  She's called the "Martha Stewart of Karate" in her own press releases.  Already the Director of Children's Education for the National Association of Professional Martial Artists (does that make her a DOCENAPMA?) she's apparently a third-degree black belt.  A Beverly Hills former ballerina black-belt, but a black belt all the same. A quick gander at her website at this moment in time shows that not much has happened with the book series since it sold its film rights back in July of 2005.  In spite of its novel appearance, I wouldn't expect much more to happen either. 	 When it comes down to it, you can have a good idea for a kind of book, a good set of nonviolent attitudes, factual information on a karate technique, and still end up with a not-so-hotso book simply because the writing is sub-par.  For those kids into the idea of karate, the book will be much loved and read.  For others, however, the overly hokey writing will turn them away and they'll be far more interested in better books like "Bone".  A fine title but nothing to get worked up about 
 [This review refers to the CD-ROM "version"]  I ordered this CD because Amazon has it listed as an alternate version of PLATO: COMPLETE WORKS, edited by John M. Cooper.  Well, this is definitely false advertising.  This CD merely contains the Benjamin Jowett translations.  For those of you who don't know who Benjamin Jowett is, he was a very prominent British scholar who is largely said to be responsible for rendering Plato's works into an English classic.  While his translations are certainly important historical documents, they suffer from the fact that they were produced in the middle of the 19th century.  Yes, that's right: the 19th century.  The translations in the Cooper edition, on the other hand, are all very accurate and up-to-date.  I highly recommend the print edition of PLATO: COMPLETE WORKS (Ed. Cooper), but this CD bears no resemblance to it.  If you have ever casually surfed the internet looking for the works of Plato, you have probably had the "pleasure" of reading a Jowett translation.  All of his translations can be found for free on the internet.  In assembling this CD, someone merely copied these translations into a word file, converted it into a PDF, and shoved it on a CD.  Trust me: you can do the work yourself and save yourself twenty bucks.  
 The wireless connection on this mouse and keyboard is absolutely horrible.  With fresh batteries (changed several times) and having the pod close or far from the keyboard or mouse doesn't make any difference. The mouse is jittery and jumping right and left because of bad connection, even resetting it doesn't work.  The keyboard has the same problems, with a message popping up on the screen continually.   Avoid this product 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 `I'm Just Here For the Food Version 2.0' by Food Network culinary supernerd, Alton Brown is a revision of his James Beard award winning first book. For those who always go to the back of the book to see whodunit, this book is not worth buying if you already own the first edition.  What is surprising is that the thinness of the `improvements' to the book are apparent on the front cover, where we see that this version `includes these special upgrades, - 4 removable refrigerator magnets, -15 brand new recipes'. This does not even merit calling this a significant new edition. It falls far short of the improvements found in Brown's hero, Harold McGee's second edition of `On Food and Cooking'. It is an even bigger disappointment when you compare it to new releases of popular software. My best cases are to compare it to the excellent PC strategy games, `Sid Meier's Civilization' and `Sim City', both of which are now at `Version 4.0'. And, each new release involved a virtually complete redesign with major overhauls of mechanics and features. Merely adding new features to the existing system comes out as a new product, not unlike Volume 2 of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'.  The original ended its text on page 287 and Version 2.0 ends on page 321. This gives us 34 new pages or a 12% increase in material. What is surprising is that a large number of these pages are added to the Appendices.  In Version 1.0, the appendices start on page 240. In Version 2.0, the appendices start on page 256, showing that the additions to the main text are nothing more than the 15 new recipes. We will come to these later. The best news about these additions is that a sizable chunk of these 18 pages comes in the Index. I am a big fan of good indices and tables of contents, as I think that they can double or even triple the value of a cookbook. Most of the rest of the additions to the appendix are marginal. Much goes to the touted refrigerator magnets showing the major cuts of meat from cattle, hogs, lamb, and chickens. The diagrams surrounding these doo-dads are a bit better than in Version 1.0, but not nearly as good as you will find in, for example, the Larousse Gastronomique.  As I stated in my review of the original volume, I am a seriously doting fan of Mr. Brown's work, and his recent `Feasting on Asphalt' Food Network miniseries and his contribution as commentator on `Iron Chef America' continue to win my admiration. I firmly believe that AB's voice-over to the cooking are what makes the show as entertaining as it is. If that were gone, the show would sink into mediocrity and disappear. On the other hand, AB has been lured into turning his printed output into something of a brand, very similar to Mark Bittman's `How to Cook Everything' rubric and Rachael Ray's '30 Minute Meal' mantra. Oddly, of these three, I thing Rachael has given her audience the greatest value per title.  I thought Alton's second volume was almost pure rip-off, and this volume is very close to being the same kind of exploitation of his audience. AB redeemed himself with his fourth and fifth titles, which I believe are superb services to amateur cooks and bakers.  My biggest single surprise in this Version 2.0 is the fact that there seemed to be no effort whatsoever to fix the `bugs' in the original text. The most obvious type of `bug' was misspellings. I may be able to forgive misspelling the famous plastic model making brand, Revel, but I have a harder time forgiving the use of an archaic and unfamiliar name, `cimeter' for a type of knife much more commonly know as a `scimitar' (OK, so `cimeter' IS in my Webster's Unabridged 3rd Edition, but AB's use is really annoying, when the more common spelling is so much more familiar).  Before I get into the additional recipes, I must say that in spite of how much I like AB's explanations of food science and technique, I virtually never use any of his recipes. If Alton and Mario Batali or Bobby Flay or Jacques Pepin or Nick Malgieri or James Peterson gave me conflicting information, I would use the advice from the professional chef or professional teacher over AB's suggestion or recipe. That's because, as Daniel Boulud has so clearly stated, the thing which separates the amateur from the professional is the fact that the professional has made the same dish a thousand times over, so that all the inefficiencies in his method have been worn off, leaving the essence of good method. And, in the case of professional teachers Malgieri and Peterson, they have studied the professionals, so their advice is as good or better than the practitioner.  Regarding the recipes, I think it is poor form that Alton did not highlight the new ones in his table of contents; however, if you happen to own both Version 1.0 and Version 2.0, you can easily find the new recipes by laying out the tables of contents side by side and locate the additions. And, I find that some of the new recipes are a waste of time. While I don't actually make AB's recipes, I generally find them, especially on his `Good Eats' show, to be excellent illustrations of his points. In this book, some of the new recipes do nothing to advance our understanding of his cooking principles. The `Roasted Tomato Soup' is a perfect example, as the recipe involves no roasting! It uses roasted tomatoes from the previous recipe, giving us no illumination on roasting technique (and, I think Ina Garten's roasted tomato soup is better).  If you own Version 1.0, stay away from this new edition. It is clearly not worth an additional $32.50! If it were not for AB's autograph in my Version 1.0, I would give it away. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 I was very disappointed by this book. I was very eager to read this book and learn about Wolfram's thoughts about a new approach to science, but there is nothing in this book that justifies such a lofty title. The first six chapters of the book describe various types of cellular automata, which are computational models whose evolutionary behavior is governed by simple rules. Wolfram devoted much of his scientific career studying such systems.   One particular system that has caught Wolfram's interest is a cellular automata model that he calls "Rule 30". What is so remarkable about "Rule 30"? Rule 30 starts off with a single element and, through repeated application of a simple rule, rapidly evolves into a system involving apparently complex behavior.   There were two big problems with the first six chapters of this book. First, Wolfram never bothers to try to explain what is so special about "Rule 30". Why doesn't Rule 29 or Rule 31 show complex behavior? What are the essential elements of Rule 30 that give complexity? Wolfram gives no information on this. A second big problem is that Wolfram is much too repetitive. The point that complexity can be generated by simple rules is hammered in over and over again. This book could clearly have used a lot of editing.  The rest of the book describes ways in which cellular automota can by applied to various scientific problems, but no concrete, specific pathways are given for how to tackle these various problems. Rather, the chapters consist of various suggestions and musings by Wolfram on how cellular automata may relate to a wide range of scientific problems. The breadth of his discussions is more impressive than their depth, which often never gets much deeper than noting visual similarities between some of his diagrams and the physical appearances of shells, tiger stripes, snowflakes, etc.  A key problem with this book is that it never attempts to analyze why some rules give "complex" behavior and why others  don't. I'm reminded of a story that Wolfram himself related about the time he showed Richard Feynman a printout of "Rule 30":  "Well, we'd just been crawling around the floor--with help with some other people--trying to use meter rules to measure some feature of a giant printout of it. And Feynman takes me aside, rather conspiratorially, and says: "Look, I just want to ask you one thing: how did you know rule 30 would do all this crazy stuff?" "You know me," I said. "I didn't. I just had a computer try all the possible rules. And I found it." "Ah," he said, "now I feel much better. I was worried you had some way to figure it out." "  Both Wolfram and Feynman are geniuses, but Feynman had something that Wolfram doesn't: A gift for seeing past the unessentials and getting to the gist of a problem. Wolfram fills his books with countless pages of diagrams showing "complex" behavior, but never tries to explain the essential nature of Rule 30.  After reading this book, I'm also reminded of a statement by Freeman Dyson, another brilliant scientist, after he looked at Wolfram's book: "There's a tradition of scientists approaching senility tocome up with grand, improbable theories. Wolfram is unusual in that he's doing this in his 40's" 
 I just can't understand who thinks this guy has any talent!  REALLY!  So many other funny guys...and this hack is the guy that is popular???!!  AVOID this CD...wasted my money 
 Using the word spoken by the main character in this book, I am compelled by "candor" to describe what this book is really about.  Only one review reports the "second" story line in the book: the real Duke Lacrosse rape case.  The fictional details follow the facts with little deviation: "[two] wealthy white collegiate tennis players," African-American single mother/stripper.  The fictional prosecutor, like real D.A. Mike Nifong, was appointed by the Governor. It is too bad for Mr. Coben that this book with trial scenes was set in type for printing before the N.C. Attorney General threw out the real rape cases and declared the three lacrosse players "innocent."  If Mr. Coben had guessed correctly at a jury verdict of guilty, his would have been the first fictional account with the likelihood of the sale of movies rights to the book 
 I was disappointed there was not more substance to this novel.  Fitzgerald was less than halfway finished when he died, and the seventeen "completed" episodes were in obvious need of re-editing.  Judging from the author's notes, they would have been revised extensively anyway to fit his shifting vision of how the plot would evolve.  There are moments of clever satire on the Hollywood Industry (and especially its writers) that would probably have made the finished product well worth reading, but Fitzgerald was still struggling to balance the satirical tone of his novel with the love story of its protagonists.  The editor's notes were very helpful, though, inasmuch as they showed what direction Fitzgerald wanted to take and the alternate endings he had in mind 
 I watched the theory of gravity being debated by string theorists on TV last week.  If gravity can still be debated why not Darwin's version of evolution?  The National Academy's book ignores the real reasons Christians find it difficult to accept Darwin.  Why is mere random chance and un-intelligent design a more likely explanation for DNA, the human brain, the eye, and complex mirco-organisms than intelligent design?  Everything cited in the National Academy's book could just as likely support intelligent design as unintelligent design.  If your worldview is that man is nothing more than an evolved monkey, has no special purpose, and was not created by God or in the image of God, than Darwin's evolution story is your only  explanation for the origin of life and evolution.     Unfortunately, as we clearly see today, under this worldview right and wrong, truth and lie, become relative terms and are whatever you want them to be.  However, if your worldview is that people are special, that maybe man has a purpose that is unfolding before him, that there are somethings that are absolutely true or absolutely wrong, and that we each have a soul then intelligent design opens the door to another way of looking at science and the world.  I feel I'm a mainstream Christian, and no Christians I know deny that animals evolve. Clearly animals do change over time.  We simply see purpose in the world.  Why can't it be true that animals evolve for a reason, not because of a random roll of the dice.  Why does the creation of the universe have to be a fluke and not the result of design?  That however is not allowed to be debated today.  For thousands of years scientists studied the world to reveal the true nature of God.  Only recently has the definition of science changed to exclude any meaningful or caring God. As for me, I look at the world (and the fossil record) and I see purpose, meaning, and intelligence. God is not my philosophy, God is my reality.  
 And say that this is one of my least favorite Reba albums.  Its too far out there for me that I can't bear to listen to it except for one or two songs.  That's not enough to make me like a record.  An album should contain more than just "filler" songs.   Most of this album is "filler".  
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 Like so many others, the Fed chairman is a mediocrity who rose to prominence by serving as a flunkey to David Rockefeller through exclusive membership in the J.P. Morgan-Chase billionaire's semi-secret Trilateral Commission.  Greenspan has long deserved to be exposed not for his own evil but for the greater evil that he is covering up.  Unfortunately, Batra's book is so poorly done, that one almost suspects that he was paid by Rockefeller to write it.  The author begins by assuming what he is trying to prove thereby destroying any possibility of being taken seriously as an economist because of his unscientific bias.  In fact, the only thing that can be said in his favor is that he is honest enough not to make any pretense of objectivity.  He tells you right off that this is going to be a hatchet job and immediately gets down to looking for facts to support his allegations.  Instead of talking about Greenspan's relationship to Rockefeller, Batra diverts attention to any problem that exists in the economy and blames it on Greenspan.  This is like a medical book discussing cancer in terms of its symptoms rather than its causes 
 	A foreign girl moves to North America, a place she was never suspected to have fit in, and manages to become the top student in her class. Ewa or Eva Hoffman was a thirteen year old, Polish immigrant when she arrived in Vancouver. She adapted quite well after a year of uncomfortable living. She became the Valedictorian of her high school, went to Rice University, and then Harvard. Lost in Translation by Eva Hoffman is a book not worthy of the reader's time. 	 	The main character in this book complained about her situation too much. Maybe Eva didn't want to move, but it turned out for the better. She was safer, she got a better job then what she was hoping for, and she got to experience a whole new lifestyle. Instead, Eva complained that she didn't fit in because she didn't wear make-up or because nobody understood her Russian jokes. The majority of the book was filled up with complaints. Another example would be how she was mad that her friend at college was just too stupid to understand her, but actually Eva was just over analyzing the situation. Everything that happened to Eva in America had a negative side to it, which the author always wrote about.  	This book was also very difficult to understand. The author jumped from time period to time period in an unsystematic way. At one point she was talking about high school, the next paragraph was college, then her childhood, then the boat voyage, and finally back to high school. The author could be talking about piano lessons in America and then she will write about her best friend in Poland and how much she misses her. If the book was in a regular pattern, readers may be able to understand her life story and maybe even enjoy it slightly.  	This book is completely uninteresting and it has no plot. The author basically wrote down a bunch of random events that don't form a story. Even if the book was in a sensible order it, the story would have no plot and it would still be perfectly boring. The author just tells a bunch or random events that happened. An example would be when she overheard her parents talking about books, then it was about her friend at a school for the arts, then the author moved on to a summer vacation. The author can move on to different events because this is a biography, but there is no sense in jumping from event to event without actually having a reason.  	Lost in Translation by Eva Hoffman is simply a book that should not be read unless absolutely necessary. Eva complaints were far too many, the book was difficult to comprehend, the book has no storyline, and it just isn't interesting.  A. Coffin 
 Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.  What a shame 
 This epic is often talked up as some kind of ancient thriller, a there-and-back-again from the 1st Century B.C.  However, even a casual read will reveal the problematic nature of an assessment of this nature.  The poem is in reality a subtle and complex study of the nature of Greek epic.  Apollonius is not simply writing an adventure story, the story was common knowledge then and there were multiple versions people could turn to.  Apollonius, the scholar is meditating upon epic and its place in a modern world.  The text is incredibly ambiguous and can reveal millions of alternate readings.  Apollonius needs to be read again and again, often in the context of earlier epic works.  You cannot fully understand Apollonius without Homer.  On the surface it is an adventure story, but with no real hero, no real ending and with often no real motives. A good translation by someone who understands the text is a must.  Unfortunately I don't think that Rieu is up to the task.  Only recently has Apollonius become a viable subject for study, and I think that Rieu's translation is out of date.  By trying to turn Apollonius' text into an exciting adventure like his Odyssey, Rieu skips over textual ambiguities that imbue the text with more meaning.  He even mistranslates the opening sentence and ruins its effect.  Anyone looking for Apollonius is best advised to turn to Hunter's superb translation in Oxford Worlds Classics, it's modern, up to date and accurate 
 The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again 
 I have just finished the first two modules and let me tell you that if you are a pure beginner to HTML, DO NOT get this book.  Module two is very confusing with very few examples for the beginner.  I have been designing pretty decent web pages (www.pacificlittleleague.org) with MS Frontpage 2002 and wanted to learn HTML so I could advance to using javascript & flash.  This book was a mistake purchase.  It is not for the beginner.  I have read all of the other comments that convinced me to buy this book, and all I can say is that maybe this would be a good book if you have already dabbled in some HTML.  If you look at some of the test questions at the end of module 2, such as #9 which asks about the proper XHTML format for closing the hr tag, you will find that she hasn't even covered the tag hr yet.  In # 11 it asks to rewrite "the text below" so that it doesn't show up on a web page - and then there is no text shown that could be rewritten.  The author really needs to get in a frame of mind to that of a true beginner if she is going to sell this book as a beginner book 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 This is one of the greatest books ever written 
 This was my second Ted Bell book and I must say it was better than the first (which is really not saying anything).  The action is face paced enough to keep you interested but in the end the horrendous technical inaccuracies, ridiculous characters, and poor writing make you wish you'd never started it.    I made a long list of technical inaccuracies as I read, but I will limit this rant to only one.  Hawke's super yacht (which we know already contains a plane and a speed boat from his last book) is now equipped with an Aegis radar system!  Most commonly seen on US guided missile cruisers and destroyers, Aegis' SPY 1 radar uses 4 gigantic phased-array panels that emit enough energy to cook a human being.  Somehow he has secretly attached these to a yacht without anyone seeing them. ARG 
 I love my Dyson vacuum because it works better than any other vacuum I've ever owned and I have spent more money on other vacuums and I have been disappointed until now.  But the floor attachment is an overpriced piece of junk and I am being polite.  Mr. Dyson should have made it differently because I am afraid of scratching my wood floors with this attachment 
 Order the book Nostradamus by Stephen Skinner Francis King. Than 
 These guys have to be the blueprint for all the hilarious cheesy songs the Southpark guys use on their TV show and in "Team America".  You can't find much rock n' roll music that is weaker than Nightranger.  And to think this is the greatest hits!  Horrible, horrible music.   Back in the 80's when everyone was listening to this instead of the Replacements it was laughable.  20 years later it's even more laughable and shocking.  The ONLY way anyone could enjoy this would be listening in a nostalgiac sense.  If you were 12 in 1985 
 While not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow, this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four. Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame!  
 I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The needle noise in the recording was more prevalent than on a c.d. that I had burned from an old vinyl record 
 I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all 
 I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.  I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. "A Light in August" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated 
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 If you are interested in this book, you are probably a baby boomer concerned about the aging of your mind due to occasional forgetfulness.  Schacter will give you much comfort that your brain is most probably perfectly fine.  Daniel Schacter explains that our brains are programmed to forget and delete trivial clutter to allow our cognitive resources to deal with the contemporary complexities of daily life.  I thought the brain worked like a bad hard disk PC drive.  After reading this book, I understand it works like an excellent Internet browser that automatically empty its cache memory, so it can function on new searches.   Schacter mentions patients endowed with near perfect memory.  They were overwhelmed  by information overload.  Not able to differentiate trivia from important information, they lead dependent miserable lives.  Schacter made me understand that there is nothing perfect about a perfect memory.          Schacter also made me aware how unreliable our memories are.  This has serious judicial implications affecting the credibility of eyewitnesses and plaintiffs relying on recalled memories from their childhood.  Next time you concede an argument because the other party stated they clearly remembered a specific situation, attempt to get to the objective data to check the evidence.   Memories are highly fallible.        So why am I giving this book a 2?  It is because the writing is dry and lengthy.  Another author, Aaron Nelson in his book "Achieving Optimal Memory" elegantly summarizes "The Seven Sins..." in just 11 pages.  You actually don't learn much more after reading the entire 200 pages of "The Seven Sins..." Schacter shares so many clinical examples in such exhaustive details about each of the Sins, that he exhausts most readers in the process.  Instead, I do recommend "Achieving Optimal Memory" that covers not only the "Seven Sins" but a lot more and much more efficiently in a much easier to read 200 page book.  
 I agree with reviewer Zzzz. This book is a mass of twisted stories that seem totally unnecessary 
 I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series 
 A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull 
 I love enya, but I was dissapointed when I heard the remix version of "Only Time".To tell you the truth, it sounds like someone just started to play with different notes on a keyboard.But of coarse her voice is still beutiful in the song. I think they should have left the song how it was.The other is the better version by far 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it. 
 This Backstreet Boys record tanked BIG TIME. Nick Carter is now a woman beating coward as he knows a guy would annihilate him. Brian Littrell says he found God, he found schlong instead. AJ can't stay away from booze. Howie and Kevin are as it appears the two lone sane ones. However, Incomplete and the rest of this album proved that teen pop is over. The last reviewer needs to be pecked with a beak. 
   There are many things I enjoyed about this book.  However, I did not find the synthesis of material original or the narrative style compelling.  He opens arguments which are quite debateable, such as implying that the Revolution's impetus was spurred by the energy of the Great Awakening, and then provides no further elaboration or evidence to support his assertion.  In one paragraph he refers to European soldiers as scum and dregs and then bemoans the fate of the aristocratic officer corp who have to rely on beatings and hangings to keep the kidnapped soldiery in line.  This makes Middlekauff sound incredibly dated, prejudiced and unsophisticated.   For a military history read Christopher Ward instead.  
 **This review pertains to the audiobook version, not the print version.**   The narrator (Mirron Willis) does splendid voice characterizations for all of the characters -American, British, Ugandan...  All except for the Scot, Nicholas Garrigan.  Willis makes the Scottish doctor sound mildly retarded or speech-impaired (or both?).  Unfortunately, since the doctor's voice predominates throughout the book, I just couldn't bear listening to the whole thing.  Too bad.. 
 I ordered "Elvis - 30 #1 Hits" and this CD was fine. Along with that order, I ordered "Elvis 2nd to None".    The CD case was damaged, and the actual CD contained songs in it that were damaged...  Unfortunately it was a gift that I gave someone in another state, which makes it too complicated to return.. 
 dispatches is boring. herr read too much kerouac and obviously writes stoned, as other reviewers said. the result: when you read this you think "what a wasted opportunity". it may be herr's version of vietnam, but it's so personal and biased that it can't really be considered a work of art.  in between the lines he seems to say that he has endured vietnam - and there's no doubt about it - but in what capacity? as a reporter?  this is an important theme in the second half of the book, and herr gets completely lost in his ramblings. he also wants to tell us that vietnam is a hell, but the reader doesn't feel it's hell. one only feels boredom. it's almost like herr is saying, "forget it, I can't express on paper what vietnam was". So, why write this? (herr co-wrote the script of apocalypse now and full metal jacket and probably contributed the boring parts). the book fails as a memoir and it also fails as a historical log - which we all know it's not. could this book be succesful?: yes. if it had a structure, if herr didn't waste time on stupid details, if he wasn't so egocentric, if the rhythm was improved.  contrast: the movie platoon is much, much better. or the deer hunter. those works capture hell. this book doesn't 
 I have a hugh selection of pepper books, this is one of the best.  Great illustrations, good listing of pepper types and sources, and great, yet simple receipes.  If you grow peppers , as I do, the section on gardening is straight forward.  A hint, always grow larger types in a cage 
 Of the 6 films, 3 are old films made in the '40 (Air Force; Command Decision; 30 Seconds Over Tokyo) and widely available in dvds for sometime.  Hell to Eternity is an obscure war film.  36 Hours is more fitting for espionage catagory.  The Hill, which is probably the most powerful film among the 6, is a prison film.  A carefully selected Sidney Lumet Collection is highly anticipated 
 I bought this book 2 months ago and I am still kicking myself for spending the money. I found this book to be condescending, preachy and at times, down right irratating. I was looking for practical, sensible tips on how to live my life in a more frugal and environmentally friendly manner.  All I got from this book was pie-in-the-sky, warm and fuzzy, painfully trite prose.  It became increasingly obvious as I forced myself to plow through this book, page by sappy page, that McBride spent far too much time researching quotes as headers for her chapters.  Had she spent anywhere near as much time writing about tried and true, honest to goodness money saving tips and techniques,  this book would not be such a waste.  To anyone considering this purchase, check it out of the library first to see if you like it, I sure wish I had 
 I'm not sure what the others were reading but I thought this was a waste of my money. The book is huge- much bigger than I expected- but I was looking for some specific workout programs and it falls way short on that. It claims to have a 12-week program but I've thumbed through several times and can only find 3 weeks worth. Perhaps I have to dive into it more but I find it confusing to find what you're looking for and unorganized. If you're looking more for information about working out, diets, etc. then maybe it's for you 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read.  I must say I was disappointed.  The idea behind the book is interesting.  But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible.  The characterizations are thin.  The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50.  It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.   I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 if blum's book has any shred of validity (that the USA and capitalism is evil)?  why is he still alive in the "evil" USA, and how did this drivel of a book get publish in the "evil" USA?  like the religous right and islamic fundmentalists you can't argue or reason with these leftist kooks or there supporters.  they are going to believe what they want to believe.    fallacies and data taken out of context become doctrine, and science and facts are irrelevant.  blum is an emotionally driven zealot of the marxist religon.    still like many faith-based works of fiction, these brainwashed leftist writings are easy and enjoyable to read.  
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 Me especially I cannot hate on Cam cuz I got his first albums and thats when he was serious lyrically. Either the money went to his head or he just ran outta s*** to say. And judgin that his subject matter stays the same I guesss its true. Dude spits some retarded a** lyrics. I give this CD a two cuz of the beats. But this dude is a certified beatwaster. These producers need to give these beats to rappers who can actually spit bars. This n***a sumtimes don't even rhyme 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 BOO has to be the worst horror movie I have seen in a long time. Poorly conceived, badly acted (and, boy, is the acting BAD), atrociously written, sloppily directed and lacking anything approaching a genuine sense of atmosphere, this film has virtually nothing to recommend it. There are occasional (VERY occasional) glimpses of the film that might have been, but every opportunity is wasted and all we're left with is ninety tedious minutes of teenage histrionics and unnecessary (and unconvincing) gore. Even some of the potentially disturbing imagery (not to mention the presence of Dee Wallace Stone - oh, how careers can plummet!) cannot save it. The one thought I came away with at the end is 'How do people with so little talent and aptitude actually get the opportunity and funding to make a film like this in the first place?' I guess that's one of life's more baffling mysteries, that and the assumption on the part of film makers that horror fans will accept any old rubbish. Avoid this film like the plague. It is truly, truly dreadful 
 Rabelais is much heralded for his skewering of the rich and powerful.  Frankly he does not measure up to Thomas More, Machiavelli, Erasmus or Castiglione or their writings.  Some may find his works clever or cute, they may certainly rattle pre-conceptions of the stiffness of the era.  As for me, it lacked wit and was mostly just crude, which some find to be groundbreaking but in fact crudeness has existed through out the ages 
 I was hoping that this book would provide me with some insight into how individuals are actually affected by war, but this book is nothing more than a forum for the author to express his blatent anti-war opinions.  As a psychologist myself, I found this book to contain no real psychology, and the author's statements and accusations were not bolstered by any solid research.  If you are interested in reading about the true psychology of war, I would not recommend this book.  
 I am dumbfounded by all the 5-star reviews. This book is absolutely dreadful.   I was skeptical of this sort of manifestion/metaphysical approach to wealth and success at first, but after using it I am becoming increasingly less skeptical.  I have a hard time buying everything prosperous-universe crown promotes, but at the very least, keeping an attitude of hope and optimism helps you persevere through hard times. On the other hand,  I think that approaching this sort of thing with an open mind includes--importantly--remaining open enough to admit when something doesn't work, and not to rationalize the failure ("I must be indulging negative thoughts," or "The Universe must not think I'm ready for what I desire"). I'm guessing that people are raving about these books and awarding them so many stars because of what the books promise (and they CAN be inspirational), not what the techniques actually deliver with consistency, and I think that is especially true of Wilde's book.  This book is a unique train wreck. I found it so unreadable that I got through 54 pages and gave up, then as an heroic effort of perseverance picked it up again and struggled on.  When Abraham Lincoln said, "He can compress the most words into the smallest idea of any man I know," he could well have been talking about Stuart Wilde.   Wilde goes on interminably about the most modest of ideas, as though he has discovered the Philosopher's Stone. I'd almost rather listen to a Hollywood celebrity blather on about politics than read another page of this godawful book. The first 4 chapters of the book could have been expressed in a concise 6 or 7 pages, but instead Wilde babbles on with his dimestore philosophizing--stuff that is really embarrassingly simplistic--and with stories that seem to have little purpose beyond demonstrating how unutterably clever and superior he is. He *is* occasionally funny, during those rare instances (I count two) when through sheer dint of will he is able to deploy a little strategic understatement, but most of the time he writes with a grandness totally unbefitting his modest thoughts, and it all ends up sounding very stupid.   Wilde evinces a smug and outrageous self-love in this book that is quite unbearable and that makes it practically impossible to digest the infrequent good advice that he presents (an example of which is one mentioned by another reviewer, viz., to practice accepting by really accepting everything offered, including picking up pennies on the street). Reading this book, you get a sense of the author's sense of self-grandiosity (even while he's condemning people's egos), and as a result it does not surprise you when you find your way to his website and see him present himself as a visionary and a prophet (one prone to conspiracy-mongering).  Wilde display contemp for anyone whose priority is not amassing wealth. For instance, at one point he condemns a researcher he knows for going to Argentina to conduct entymological research on "some dumb beetle," and dismisses this pursuit of knowledge for its own sake as the fellow's unwillingness to enter the marketplace. This comes immediately after his dismissal of college education as time spent learning "useless stuff." The book is fecund with idiotic assertions of this sort.  There are MANY better books on success, and probably the worst of them is still better than this one. A much better book of this type is "Shortcut to a Miracle," or even Joe Vitale's "The Attractor Factor," which although flawed is vastly more readable that this piece of garbage. Don't be fooled by these glowing reviews. This book is awful 
 I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target 
 In 2004, the Boston Red Sox finished four games behind the New York Yankees at the conclusion of a 162-game regular season. In the playoffs, after losing three games to the Yankees, the Red Sox -- using the momentum from the fourth game victory, if one believes in such things -- got red hot for seven games. That's it -- an eight-game hot streak. Period. Then, it was over. Boston still couldn't beat the Yankees in the 2005 regular season, and got swept out of the '05 playoffs. Anyone who attempts to draw any great conclusions from the above scenario ... who makes the Red Sox "plan" a model because of an eight-game hot streak, has absolutely no concept of baseball. That renders this book useless. 
 Ok this book is utter [crud]. It starts off ok with an introduction suggesting that something interesting will happen but unfortunetly it rapidly goes down hill. The chacrthers are dull and predictable, there is an awful lot of senseless babbling (talking about painting orasnges orange for 3 pages? oh gosh!) and no rel action. The ending tries to be shocking but is predictable and dull. This is the exact opposite of mice and men. Mice and men is a quick fast pace book with lots of action, interesting charcthers and humour. Thi is [bad]. AVoid at all costs. This really doesn't even desevere a 1 but I couldn't find -999999999999 so this will d 
 Buried in various places in this 287 page book are few intellectual gems which strikes a chord with reality. Otherwise, the authors of this book never seemed to have touched a server nor managed an IT department.  The book deals with 10 topics:  1)Lead, don't manage. (This part was very weak) 2)Understand the fundamentals of your environment (The CIOs have to understand the fundamentals too??) 3)Create a vision for how IT will build your organization's success. (You mean CIOs should have a goal??)  4)Shape and inform expectations for an IT enabled enterprise (You mean computers can't do everything??) 5)Create clear and appropriate IT governance. (The authors claim that IT governance is secret to IT success...and I was dumb enough to believe having talented personnel is secret to IT success). 6)Weave business and IT strategy together. (As if business and IT are not weaved together in the first place. Yeah, all those million dollars worth of servers are secretly being used to play video games and do nothing for the business at all) 7)Build a new IS organization--one that is leaner and more focused than its more traditional predecessor. (Do more with less...what else is new??) 8)Develop and nurture a high performance team in your IS organization. (I think this one has been written only a million times in other books). 9)Manage the new enterprise and IT Risks (Strictly fillers) 10)Communicate IS performance in business relavant language. (This chapter was nice...essentially, you should market the importance of IT as much as possible) 
 Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  Takes a very long to find position. I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing it.  I would have chosen another. 
 I really wanted to love this book. It's beautifully designed with gorgeous photographs, inspiring poses, and lofty prose. My wife and I pored over it's pages with anticipation, but when we attempted the positions, we were frustrated by scanty instructions, repetition, and fluff. Both of us are experienced in yoga, though not advanced, and most of the poses were either too tame or too difficult.  The book looks nice on the coffee table, but we're still looking for a good book on partner yoga 
 I recently purchaced this book and returned it.  I attempted to study for the test by brushing up on the history.  Yes history!  Well, it was nonexistant in this book.  It was just a big fat tip book for scoring a 5 on the AP exam 
 more than half of the selections here are garbage. 
 This coffeemaker has many flaws and is made of very cheap materials.  I bought it a couple of months ago.  The basket has a tiny spring inside that positions the lever properly in order to control the pause and serve feature.  The screw pops off very easily.  This happened to me when I cleaned the coffee maker for the first time before ever using it.  I figured out how to put the spring back in place, but it pops out almost every time it's cleaned.  Also, the lid to the carafe no longer secures properly.  I'm still using this coffee maker while in the process of trying to find another one 
 icky.  I like MNS.  A lot.  I like the things he says in interviews, I like his movies.  I don't think they are perfect, but they speak to me.  This book, while an interesting and easy read, is not fun.  I can't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it....he hasn't really publicly commented on it, other than to say the author had his full support.  I don't know--it just seemed a weird portrait of someone...it seemed over-dramatic and Vanity Fair article-esque.  Or like Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Ew.  I don't know what MNS is really like or if Bamberger interpreted things accurately.  I just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently.  [... 
 This book was too long and I just got tired of it all after awhile.  Where is it going?  What can it do for me?  Why am I reading this?  I just got so exhausted with it that I had to give up.  It's 400 pages after all -- 400!   Talk about fatigue 
 We have watched all of the movies in this collection. Some of the movies (about 1/3) are either inaudible (hard to understand what the actors are saying) and/or skip parts (words/scenes) because the film is so old. My husband and I watched at least 3 of the movies per week, and what strikes us most is that many of the films in this "horror" collection are nowhere near the "horror" movies we watched on Saturday Matinees at the movies in the 60s. Over half belong in the "mystery" or "comedy" category. And what's with all the gorillas? Every fifth movie it seems has a gorilla in it.  These horror movies are from the 20s to the 60s and are much more tame than todays horror flicks, granted. But, come on, why should we have to sit through a movie where the quality is awful and the movie is not a horror movie?   Again, there were too many gorillas! Not that there's anything wrong with gorillas, but we prefer ghosts to gorillas. 
 I saw this movie for the first time, and I found out that it is very VERY violent. And I laughed at some good parts, but the scene where Amy hits the wildlife keeper on the head with a frying pan for trying to cut the baby geese's wing IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO SEE.  I think that this movie should be taken off the market, but this type of film has no place in the lives of young children.    
 While the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written, I found the story itself uninteresting and sexist.  I would not recommend this book. 
 I expected this book to be more educational and informative. It really just gives you a couple templates and not that many ideas, you do the work on your own.  You do not need this book to create your own comic strip 
 I really cannot understand why this book has earned its acclaimed classic status.  It has little beyond the usual tired trading psychology:  - don't bet all your capital in one idea; - cut your losses; - follow the trend while it's good.  That's all - seriously, who still has not known about all these points, and for free?  Most of the interviews have not delved deep enough into how these traders analyze a trading idea, what frame work they use, why system, what data source they follow etc.  Most of the time, I have to conclude that they did it by pure luck.   Here is an example.  "... I had a plan.  I would wait until the market moved up to a certain level and then retracted by a specified amount before adding another unit..."  How did he come up with the level?  And why specified amount??  It reads terribly like he just got it off the charts!!!  Let's face it.  If I am a big, profitable trader who is still making money off my supposedly ingenius trading system, would I want to publish it in a book and share it with the rest of the world?  There you have it.  I would not want to waste your time or mine any more on this grossly over-rated book 
 Fortunately the book was not that expensive so I simply wasted time and did not match it with wasted money. The book is portrayed as a survey from Ancient Sumeria through the Roman Empire. This is patently false. I have looked all through for any reference to either the Sumerians or the Assyrians and find none. This could of course be because I read about half and decided I had wasted enough valuable time. Any information prior to the Hellenists is almost unheard of.  The author makes grand assumptions that are fine for a writer of historical fiction but not for an academic study of a subject. For example his claim that it is now "a proven fact" that the Hebrew slavery, delivery and migration to Palesine are simply myths is patently over-reaching. I know there is little archeological evidence to support the complete Biblical narrative but that is far from proof of falsehood. The author should take a clue from all those who at one time claimed that Nineveh, the Hittites and many other ancient cultures and events were myths. It is fine to speculate, but to claim as fact something that is still unknown is poor scholarship at best 
 This book is not very useful. Its very simple and real advice is missing. You learn more from prison life by wathing a good prison movie.  For example, their only advice against the rapes is that you should fight back hard with all of your strenght. Well no s**t Sherlock?! This whole book is full of this kind of tips 
 I have been reading Sandra for a while now and while "where there's smoke" is not my absolute fav (envy is, and is a must read)it ranks up there in the top three. the twist and turns keep you glued till the final page and you are not going to want to put this one down. Sometimes a little rough in places( name calling and such).But all in all a very good book 
 ... until two thirds of the way through it limps on withouit a credible resolution and turns in to a cross between Star Trek, Dead Ringers and The Invisible Man. With a better 3rd act this could have been great. The guy can write 
 I wonder why this book is such a success. I find it poorly written and not funny at all. The title is eccentric and totally misleading 
 I was really excited when I saw these reading glasses that split at the nose bar, how nifty, just wear them looped over the back of your neck and click the lens part together whenever you have to read the fine print.  Great idea, but the execution of the idea is not for everyone.  The back piece is also hard plastic, rigid, and if you have long hair, you have to lift them out from under your hair and place the plastic back strip at your mid-skull level, fit them on your ears and then fit the front parts together and snap.  From the back you end up looking like you are wearing an external orthodontic apparatus.  I'd like to see the company put a string in place of the hard plastic that loops around your neck.  The magnetic clip that brings the two lenses together in the front is a fabulous idea, and having the two lenses hanging off to the sides instead of a whole pair of glasses swaying across your front is so much more comfortable and out of the way - it's just the rigid frame at the back that makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they were mass manufactured 
 The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution 
 Edible taste, not the best but I would keep buying them if i didn't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea.  It is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you, it is any food with sugar alcohols.  All Atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol.  They do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do, so the theory is that they dont store fat.  Only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom.  You only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom.  Not Worth It 
 As an academic, whose job is to report research and organise research projects, I find mind mapping a useful tool for organising ideas, drafting outlines, monitoring progress, planning meetings, keeping minutes, etc. So I bought the book from the guy who "invented" mind mapping to learn more about it. What did I learn? In a nutshell, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, the book might even put you off for good from a quite useful tool.  Of course, if you have a special kind of humour, you can read it as a perfect parody of a "scientific" how-to book. This book is a wonderful mixture of unbearable hype, awful jargon and artful use of pseudo science. Not that the author wouldn't be clear about it: Tony Buzan (I guess Barry had his reasons for emphasising in the starting chapter that it was written by Tony ...) states right at the beginning that this book will basically solve all the problems you've ever had (in fact, not just you, !mankind!) by introducing you to "a new concept in the development of thought" and "a revolutionary new tool". It gets even better later on when you learn about mind mapping as "the next step in the evolution of the human mind". To a certain extent, the whole thing works; it does stimulate your creativity - I'm writing my first ever book review on Amazon - and it helps you practice speed reading - there is so little information amidst all this breathless writing that you can easily finish it in an hour. But let's be serious. The first couple of chapters teach you how your brain works, empty blah based on "scientific research" mostly dating back to the 1970s (of course, only material from sources of various quality exactly supporting a preconceived argument). That's a bit like James Watt explaining a fuel cell powered car to you - not completely off the mark, but, you know, a few things have happened in the meantime ... Then you get to learn the principles, "the laws" (I would have liked commandments; it would fit the style). Common sense dressed up as wisdom and nothing turned into something through fancy relabelling. I really like the distinction between the Mini Mind Map (TM) and the full Mind Map (TM). "Power words" and "basic ordering ideas" for comprehensive categories is also pretty cool. From there, you move on to applications. Same story. I skipped the end; at last I heeded other reviews of the book. But the thing that makes the book a real turn-off is the way it is written and typeset: - We know that repeating important bits aid your memory, so you get LOTS of repetitions (especially mind mapping is SUPER, mind mapping is REALLY super, you get the idea ...). - We know that metaphors help you memorise stuff, so you get LOTS of them (really hilarious stuff, I failed to note it down while reading). - We know that using the odd adjective and slightly colourful language enhances readability, so you get LOTS of it. This is where the book scores 12 out of 10 points. It's littered with superlatives like infinite, enormous, gigantic, etc. and very large numbers (trillions, quadrillions, 1's and lots of 0's behind them). An example "... means that we are all magically and eerily different from each other. ... You who are now reading this sentence contain, in your brain, trillions of associations shared by no one else, past, present or future" (p. 72). Spooky would have been nice there! - We know that highlighting text adds emphasis, so we get LOTS of HigHLIghTEd text. - We know that using different fonts add visual clarity, so we get LOTS of different fonts. - We know that boxes are useful for setting apart important points or illustrative material, so we get LOTS of them. - We know that a good image says more than a thousand words, so we get LOTS of psychedelic mind maps, most of them unreadable, but very LOUD. - We know that selling nothing as something can work if you dress it up well, so you get LOTS of it, e.g. "Intuition is a much-maligned mental skill which I and neuropsychologist Michael Gelb prefer to define as 'superlogic'" (p. 111) which then allows you to engage in "superthinking" (you know, my friend and expert-of-the-human-psyche Joe Abrahamovitch Miller and I like to call it the thing only our wives have ... Joe, by the way, is a the bartender in the local pub around the corner). You also get the "parabrain", the "paraconscious", you get the regular urban myth that we only use a fraction of our brain, and so on and so forth.  I could go on, but I guess you get the picture. By the way, if you're still reading, you stand a good chance of finishing the book ... Here are a few suggestions for improvements in future editions (of which there will be many, I'm sure): - don't be shy of large numbers, I missed the quintillions! - referring to the Greek and the Romans as well as a lot of people with weired slavonic names is ok. But times are changing: These days you have to have some Indians and Chinese in there and Atlantis doesn't hurt. You could also refer to the wisdom of the animal kingdom and wisdom acquired in earlier lives.  To conclude, a comment by a colleague of mine: "Can you inject the stuff? 
 We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly. At first I was thrilled the Sony when I used it downstairs during her daytime napping & loved that I could set it to voice-activated & only hear it when she's reallllly awake! But that night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence in the form of a loud static chirp after several hours of silence even though it was on voice-activated mode. I tried moving it several times, but finally ended up going back to the old FP sounds & lights one we had which really wasn't any better! (AND having to run up & down the stairs to try all the combinations of 9 channels on the receiver & transmitter of the Sony was a royal pain!)  The next day I went to Target & found The First Years Digital 2.4ghz Monitor & what a difference! It was about the same price as the Sony, but it searches for a clear channel like your phone does. I was afraid it would interfere with out 2.4ghz phones, but after a week, no problems & we have NO static/interferrence! It's crystal clear no matter where in the house (hubby even took it into the computer room & was able to hear her wake up just fine!) I know everyone's environment is different, but the Sony definately didn't work for us 
 I enjoyed the book so much that I ran out and bought the DVD.  Although it was well-cast and entertaining to a degree, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed.    For starters, this 4-hour miniseries is FAR too long.  It dragged on painfully at times and could easily have been cut by a full hour (and very possibly two).  Also, it focuses almost entirely on the struggle of the main characters while omitting most of the interesting scientific narrative and anecdotes that make the book so fascinating.  The impact of the story is severely diminished without this narrative.  Moreover, I think it is difficult to figure out what is happening during most of the series unless you have read the book first.  It is unclear why many of the secondary characters exist, and their interactions with the main characters are virtually inscrutable at times.  All in all, it is obvious that a significant effort went into this series but I think it could have been better 
 I just spent the afternoon reading this after feeling mesmerized by the first one, Mote.  It was terribly disappointing.  OK, perhaps not a pure commercial potboiler, but vastly inferior to the mysteries and utter fascination within the first one.  In this, you know the problem:  the aliens, by their biology of uncontrolled population increase, are a terrible threat to mankind.  But ah, humans have been able to experiment with some of them for decades; the deus ex machina solution that emerges after some spectacular fighting is, to say the least, a letdown.  Everything else is needless detail.  That makes this a profound scifi dud, lacking the magic of the original.  Not recommended, except for uncritical cultists 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 This is not an example of writing that will get people enthusiastic about space travel.  It will put them to sleep first.  It appears to have been slapped together by someone with minimal editorial experience. Even the illustrations were amateurish and the copy I received was misprinted 
 Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :- 
 if you're planning on reading it in french, I woudl recommend that you buy the full version, not the "extraits&quot 
 This collection has a serious handicap in the omission of "Flower Drum Song." This gem is not available at all on DVD. What a loss to all 
 I found this book to be flawed in its very nature.   Scarf attempts to explain the problems of the couples in her book using categories and classifications of psychoanalytic theory that are utterly unfounded.  She  attributes the problems of mairrage to self-imposed psychoanalytic  conventions that do not have a true basis in real life.  Her explanations  of things such as "projective identification" are almost comical  to the reader with a critical eye.  For example, she attributes the jealosy  of one partner to the other partners, unexpressed, repressed feelings.   This analysis seems to try to stretch a simply jealosy issue of one partner  onto the other.  The takes a simple problem and makes it complicated with  carefully selected detail and over-zealous classification 
 The Grays is the latest discourse on alien visitation by Whitley Strieber. While fully clothed as a novel it is abundantly clear that although the narrative events and characters are fictional, the over-arching message - that we are contact with entities from another world - is the center-piece of the work.  Communion, published in 1998, was Mr. Strieber's first foray into non-fiction. In it, he claimed to have been regularly approached by extra-world creatures that seem to need contact - both physical and spiritual - with us. Since then, there have been several more alleged non-fiction works that amplified on Mr. Strieber's experiences as well as those of family, friends and members of what I will call the abductee community. There is also the rather brilliant "Majestic," an out-and-out novel that described the events around and leading from the Roswell Incident of 1948.  It is "Majestic" that is a connective tissue to "The Grays" in that both are driven by the fact that living aliens were captured after a vehicle crashed in the New Mexico desert. However, in the former work, it is the nature of the cover-up and the allegorical rapture of the main character that is the core of the story.  "The Grays," on the other hand, is about the why of the visitation/abduction cycle. We learn why the human race is important to the Grays and how the US government has gone along with their wants and needs to propel its agenda.  The early part of the book introducing the various characters is bumpy and a bit incoherent, as if Strieber perhaps grafted it on late in the writing/editing process or - more likely in my opinion - used some older work notes. I say this because there are some time sequence problems and muddiness about characters.   This all goes away once the story takes hold. Strieber launches his characters - who are, as another reviewer noted, somewhat single-dimensional; almost caricatures - on an adventure story that could have been written by Clive Cussler or Steven Coonts or Arthur C. Clarke.   And therein lays the rub for me. The "Communion" series addressed some major metaphysical issues in that Strieber often stated his inability to determine if the "aliens," be they Gray, Blues, Nordics or whatever, were from another world or simply another dimensional manifestation of our own. There were times that Strieber seemed to imply that religion may have sprung from these entities. Here, we are dealing with a more-or-less straight forward space opera with heavy overtones of government mis- and mal-feasance that include allusions to the war in Iraq and the military-industrial complex. There is narrative flow, but there is no meaningful attempt to explain alien visitation on the sort of higher plane found int he toher works. In a way, I felt cheated at the end of the story because  Mr. Strieber manages to denigrate his preceding works by producing a workman-like and somewhat tedious page turner that raises but one question: "Will the good guys beat out the bad guys?"  But, we are not even granted that answer! Instead, in the manner of the Sci-Fi serials of the 30s and 40s, we see a crisis averted but with no true resolution. Instead, one feels that the real message is "wait for the sequel!"   
 ...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. 
 ﻿well written and mildly interesting. however the author appears to think that we the people will be safer if we (the people) would simply give ourselves over to Big Brother.  Frankly terrorism and terrorists come and go, but the constitution is with us always. Unlike the author, I'll keep the constitution and bill of rights and take my chances with terrorists.  As an example of the authors flawed thinking, he mentions that after 1973, when new airport screening was introduced, 5000 guns were collected from passengers as if this were a good thing (or that armed passengers were a bad thing) but what he fails to grasp that, although 5000 guns were collected there were NOT 5000 or even 500  or even 5 incidents involving firearms then or in the previous years before screening. Nor does he seem to make the connection that the 9/11 hijackers managed to take over their aircraft with box cutters and planning and willingness to die. Could armed passengers or pilots have made a difference? Would things have been any worse?  Lets look at the UK. Many surveillance cameras and draconian police powers. The result? Pretty pictures of men alleged to be bombers (yet the bombs still went off and a second attempt almost succeeded) and one innocent man shot dead by police.   Terrorists are always going to be with us. In an industrial society technology acts as a force multiplier. One or two or a dozen men can kill thousands if they are determined. Auto accidents kill 50K/year.  A Tsunami  will kill tens of thousands. Civil war kills hundreds of thousands. And a pandemic may kill millions.  And no one is even bothering to count dead and dying of starvation.   Terror is a problem, but it's more a problem of the mind and the author is stoking fears to sell books. Shame on him.     
 BTS a book that stinks!  I am a true crime fan and this book is without doubt the absolutely worse book of true crime that I have ever read!  I skipped the entire middle of the book and just read the last few pages.  "Pastor Clown" is a main character..and that tell you how stupid this book actually is!  It should not even get one star 
 This is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips! How could you make ice cream taste so rotten? Bat barf I say!! Even if it was good, it is much too great of a hassle! It took my Dad over 2 hours to put together, and what did we get?! A tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top! I got this hunk of junk 2 years ago, Christmas. It has gathered dust on my shelf ever since!      
 I am an experienced crocheter and I was also trying to do the mesh hat and I tried it 3 times before I realized that there is no way that they checked these patterns before they published them.  There was no minor misstake, the pattern was totally wrong.  I figured out some of it, but I didn't have the motivation to do anymore.  Another big problem that I had is the sizing of the hats.  They are written for 19 or 20 inch heads and there are no instructions for adjustments.  The hats are very cute, but I would check the book out from the library if you can.     
 I agree wholeheartedly that the study and examination of the Old Testament and its theology is vitally important to the Christian today.  I also believe that it is both much maligned and ignored by the majority of Christians as the author states.  I believe this is due to our ignorance and arrogance.  It appears that most Christians, especially in this country, believe that we have become the chosen people - the favored nation - rather than Israel as shown in the Word.  This being said, I did not enjoy this book for a variety of reasons.  First, I found the language to be difficult to follow (which rarely happens to me) possibly due to being translated from German.  Second, since the book was written based upon essays or lectures from the author, I found it to be rather disjointed which also made it more difficult to follow the thought process.  Lastly, instead of focusing upon the actual theology of the Old Testament, the author devotes much - or most - of his efforts in cataloging various different methods of interpretation of the Old Testament 
 I liked this book, right up to the time that they leave the hospital after the (first) medical emergency. Then the author seems to say "crikey, it'll take me several hundred more pages to wrap stuff up properly...let's just paste something together." And behold, you have an ending that renders everything that happened before irrelevant. Why bother tying up anything when you can leave virtually every character hanging? What was the whole bloody point of Amanda? Why bother bringing her father's commercial dealings into the plot at all? Plus, are we to believe that two professionals in their late 30's would have absolutely--and I mean absolutely--nothing saved, and would always and forever be one paycheck from homelessness?  I finished this book last night, and while I liked it at first, the more I think about it, the less I like it. I agree with the political points it's trying to make...but this is a very flawed first novel. I'll try another novel by this author, though 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 I read the first few paragraphs, and quickly realized Mr. Baigent likes to makes outlandish claims.    Napoleon died in 1821.  60 to 100 years after that is 1921 not 2000.  But yet he makes the claim that we can compare the date of the writing of the scriptures to the date Napoleon lived and the present day.    This is patently absurd.  I decided to stop reading such a book.  If his first argument is so ridiculous, what should we expect from the rest of his book?    I returned this book of fabrications.  
 There is much better will and trust software on the market.  This software doesn't allow you to edit or make any changes in the document.  It is not a word processor either.  You cannot talor the document to you needs.  Recommend you get another product or same your money 
 olbermann is still a great sportscaster.  if only he'd kept doing the one thing he seemd to be good at--being a smart alecky sportscaster alongside dan patrick on ESPN.  unfortunately, somewhere along the way, some genius at MSNBC decided that since old keith was such a smart aleck doing sports, he'd HAVE to be great as a "newsman."  sadly, not the case.  he's just a shrill, whiny liberal and this book is just a printed reproduction of his on-air rantings 
 Luckily this book came from the library. Don't waste your money on such a sorry attempt. No police psychologist could ever be so stupid and self-centered and still have a job. Clues ignored all over the place except when Darcy wanders into the mix 
 this book is obviously written by someone who is scientifically-challenged.  basic astronomy, math, ecology, etc., do not add up.    ----------------------------   this is especially unfortunate, since the characters were created so well.  they were people who were real - complex mixtures of strengths, weaknesses, inconsistancies, virtues, stupidites, etc.  in fact, the characters and basic story were so well done, that i pushed on in the book much further than i should have, hoping that bad science would go away and i could enjoy the interaction of the people, but alas, after a hundred or so pages, i could take it no longer 
 Nothing inside, nothing usefull, 9$ for nothing. All my applause to be such a good salesman, you could sell fridge in north pole ! But for event planing..... All what is essential in this book is to not buy it 
 This barely qualifies as a book, let alone a guide. This points out, vividly, one of the drawbacks of buying books online; I never would have bought this book in a store - I would have spent 30 seconds flipping through the book, shook my head in disgust, and gone on looking.   This book is such a rip off, amazon should do something about it -- like put a big red border around this pages w/a "everyone hates this book" warning -- or better yet, stop ripping off your customers & remove this from inventory 
 Do yourself a favor and buy a real heavy duty BBQ mitt.  This one looks nice and fits well, but it starting burning one night and I threw it out 
 At this juncture, I've only had opportunity to read the publisher's summary and a reader review, wherein the author's concentration on the U.S. data is majored.  But, "the sixties" were not a uniquely American  phenomenon.  Rather, virtually the whole world convulsed in the sixties  (see, e.g., South America; Europe) and these countries were free from such  influences as Viet Nam and the American style of child-rearing.  Thus, the  true root (and an informative understanding) of "the sixties"  must be sought beyond -- as well as within -- our borders 
 I, too, wish I could get my money and time back...even though it only took me 3 hours to read it over 2 days. I laughed 4 times in the whole book. I just expected more from Larry. The last couple chapters were the funniest, and the part about Easter made me laugh out loud...but the rest was just crude. I can take crudeness but the CONSTANT mention of the "t" word for breasts was annoying. I've always hated that word and this just sealed it. I really enjoy watching Larry's cable specials but this book was just a disappointment 
 Having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years, I can assure those who swallow Breggin's nonsense hook, line and sinker that nobody could have "talked" me back to anything resembling "health."  The mental anguish I suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like Breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long.  Financial and insurance considerations aside, talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results.  No doubt pharmaceutical companies often drive treatment trends in a highly questionable manner both via perks to MD-psychiatrists and (the increasingly obnoxious) practice of direct advertising of prescription drugs to the public.  Nevertheless, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety meds and sleep aids HELP relieve the suffering quickly, which is what medicine should be all about, not ideology.  Only one of Breggin's points is valid, and that is the disturbing trend for nearly all MD-psychiatrists to focus on psycho-pharmacology to the exclusion of psychotherapy.  The current treatment model has the patient seeing a psychiatrist for meds management typically quarterly while also seeing a psychologist for psychotherapy anywhere from weekly to monthly.  It would seem that "one stop shopping" would not only make things more convenient for patients, but competence in multiple therapies would also make for a more effective and insightful professional.  Use meds to stablize the patient and minimize the suffering, then pursue cognitive and other talk therapies to provide coping skills and attack the environmental and experiential contributors to the disease. 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 This book provides a broad overview of some of the issues behind the Simplicity movement.  The author, Cecile Andrews set up a number of Simplicity study circles near her home in the Northwest.  This book reveals some of the factors that led her to become interested in Simplicity as well as her ideas of how Simplicity study circles might work.  Much of the beginning of the book provides justification for adopting Simplicity.  Andrews enumerates problems such as hyper-consumption, environmental degradation, and personal isolation.  She also explores possible actions we could take to solve these problems, such as consciously building community with other people and the earth, finding ways to express our spirituality, and restructuring our economic system to make it more environmentally and socially friendly. In the last part of the book, she describes the idea of Simplicity study circles, the benefits that might be gained from participating in one, and how a study circle should operate.  She also provides a 10-week study plan based on the earlier material in the book.  Although I agree with the ideas in this book, I found the book rather disappointing in content.  Much of the discussion is either so personal as to be hard to generalize, or else a superficial summary of other more substantial texts.  For example, Andrews frequently refers to findings of Juliet Schor; readers would have more material for discussion by reading Schor's works directly.  Some of Andrews' suggestions for addressing problems are rather inappropriate.  To draw attention to hyper-consumerism, she suggests surreptitiously clothes-pinning tags with messages like "You don't really need this, do you?" inside articles of clothing in shops.  While I'm all for trying to get people to become more aware of their needless purchases, I don't think messing with the property of individual store owners is an acceptable way to go about the mission.  Her suggestions for reforming our economic system would be great in an ideal state, but until we are run by a benevolent socialist dictator, I don't think they can realistically be put into action.  It would be better to focus our efforts on goals that are conceivably achievable.  Overall, while I found the topic of this book interesting, I think there are numerous other books on the topic of Simplicity that are better implemented, starting with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin's "Your Money or Your Life".  It's hard to tell from this book if Andrews can take credit for originating Simplicity study groups such as those run by the Northwest Earth Institute.  If so, she certainly deserves credit for her efforts in that area, but I don't think there's enough substantial material in this volume to use as background reading for an effective study group by itself. 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 I never received this book.  Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.  I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week.  This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere.  I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school. 
 Man, these guys suck. I couldn't stand listening to the 30 second samples. Click out of this page and move on with your life 
 One star is not because the Jack London stories in this book are not wonderful. It is because this book is not South Sea Tales by Jack London, which I first got from my grandfather's bookshelf and was one of the most memorable reads from my youth. It is a collection of sea stories, including four from South Sea Tales, but I have found a copy of the original stories at Barnes and Noble. One might guess that some of the stories were dropped because, like Huck Finn, they use dialogue and espouse attitudes that we now know better than to live. The stories are still great and do not deserve to become un-stories. This collection is misnamed and misleading 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 An inane pill to swallow.  The book says little in its 341 pages.  I'll never get that time back 
 Don't be misled by Peter Matthiessen's forward, this one is not for the ecologically friendly faint-of-heart.  Totch was a one man ecological disaster, constantly on the move wrecking havoc on the wildlife wherever he went.  His life of slaughtering animals for personal profit was a willful life choice, hardly dictated by the times, as he claims in his self-serving attempts to justify his pogrom against nature.  His self-indulgence was carried to the extreme by illegally poaching thousands of alligators in the protected Everglades National Park in defiance of the laws of man and nature.  The purpose for his illegal acts was personal profit, to skin the animals, only using their hides.  Their dead carcasses, several hundred in a period of a few days, were dumped into the water to rot.  This was hardly an act of survival.  He did this because he wanted to, not because he had to.  There are several other books, more accurate, better written, and less self-centered, that better describe the early pioneers of Southwest Florida.  Rather than augment Totch's bloody legacy by buying his book, I encourage readers interested in the Everglades to look elsewhere, and leave Totch's book describing his carnage against nature to rot, like one of his skinned alligator carcasses, on the ash pile of despicable acts by the self-indulgent 
 I am very disappointed in Baby Einstein.  This video has several different languages, none of which were Italian!  I even wrote a letter to Baby Einstein expressing my disappointment.  I think that Italian is a beautiful language that many people wish to learn and to leave it out of this video is unforgivable.  I no longer support Baby Einstein products.  
 The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car.  The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it.  I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail.  I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded 
 Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance.  It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting.  Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him.   The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language.  This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many "z's" and "v's."  On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like.  And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either.  Besides my criticisms, there was a good story underneath, though the ending seemed a bit abrupt 
 I really don't know how this book got a five star rating.  Nersesian's friends must have stuffed the ballots because this book has no redeeming quality what so ever. All the reviews state "this can only happen in New York" and the character Joey, "embodies the perfect paranoia found only in Manhattan".  I have lived in NYC all my life, and if I acted like this idiot, I would have been shot. People, please save your money...you'll thank me for this advice.. 
 Sarah Hudson's album has been compared to Skye Sweetnam's 'Noise From The Basement'. WHAT? There is no comparison - Skye Sweetnam has actual talent. While Sarah...  What sort of lyrics are - "I can't hold on forever/I know that you know I know" and "I wanna go shopping like Wynona Ryder" and "you better lock your doors/the bitch is back."?  "Naked Truth" is not about the music. This album is about manufacturing a woman trying to be a girl, singing about things that she's too old to identify with. The tunes are trying their best to be hardcore - but they arent. Sarah is trying her best to be Skye Sweetnam - but she's not.  Besides, Skye Sweetnam is actually a great role model for youngsters. Sarah is not 
 Among the reviewers, I am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement. It is a mixture of facts and speculation, with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them. There is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded, and I have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be. In fact, this is a self-indulgent exercise in historical erudition. I don't care what anybody else says, this is a philosophy rather than history book. The author gives a lot of facts, but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts. The author tries to integrate almost everything under the Sun into this tome, and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information 
 Stormwatch was a great title that had its highs and lows.  No point was lower than this insipid crossover that is responsible for killing off a group of interesting superheros in the cheapest possible way.  I'm a Warren Ellis fan but this was a terrible way to end the series and launch the Authority.  If a series has to end, why end it in such a weak way 
 This book reads a lot like an entry-level psychology textbook where you get a taste of what is about to come, but you never quite get there.  The author has gone to some great pain to provide you a psychological overview of what various signs and symbols mean in regard to Freemasonry.  Instead of taking the symbology at face value, as most people would do, the author has "read between the lines" and interpreted what is "really meant" by the working tools, and so forth, of the craft.  My impression is that much of the interpretation is a bit far fetched.  Case in point, the author states on page 31, "This collection of symbols, and particularly their proximity to the place in the Temple where Divinity is said to reside, indicates that a Master Mason, in the sense that we are defining him, is a person who is conscious at a psychological level which relates to the World of the Spirit in the same way that our ordinary ego is conscious of the body and the physical world."  Overall, this book is a rapid fire snapshot of many works of art regarding Masonry, but the emphasis is more-or-less on a pseudo-psychological impression that one man has attempted to define and apply to the craft.  The message throughout the book seems a bit juvenile for such a strong subject.  The text is well written though and has found a place on my bookshelf, if for no other reason than the pictures that accompany the text.  The photographs throughout the book make it worth buying if no other reason applies 
 As a Spanish teacher and native speaker I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst student. I had the "pleasure" to teach this book for 3 years (formerly named "Bienvenidos", "A bordo" and "Buen Viaje")and I didn't like it the least. The publishers came up with a new format this year but although it looks more attractive you can still find many of the SAME old activities and many of the old pictures. The vocabulary section at the end of each chapter don't have the English translation what makes it quite difficult for the student when reviewing vocabulary. They have improved the culture sections,though; but still it is not good enough. If you learn Spanish using this book, please THANK your teacher, he/she has a lot of work to do when using this book. Buena suerte!  
 I can see Jessica doing something this lame, but Nick?  He's usually the level headed one who can tell when something is just lame.  But you see him up there dancing along with the choreography like a puppet.  It's kinda sad.  The Nightrider thing was embarrassing, and Jessica is a horrible actor.  The weirdest thing was when she sang with Jewel. She's a good singer, but looks absolutely ridiculous doing it.  You can actually see Jewel trying not to laugh.  The rest of the show was just bad jokes.  Like the baseball skit where Jessica hit someone in the audience (supposedly), that was the punchline?  Seriously?  Kinda ruins the Newlyweds series for me 
 I had to stop reading because I could not tolerate this novel any longer! I read 280 pages, and just couldn't finish it. Explicit sexual scenes seem to be the norm with Baxter these days. In this pornographic novel, Baxter describes two naked teenage children having sex in public, with adults watching them while pleasuring themselves. He goes into graphic detail. It's disgusting and shameful. Oh...it's all part of the story, and their behavior is just a result of the key plot element.  That's an excuse to explore deviant behavior.  I am shocked that Clarke associated with this rubbish, because it reads nothing like a Clarke novel. For whatever reason, Baxter's publisher managed to get Clarke's name on the book. In my estimation, Clarke wrote or co-wrote the first chapter and that's all, because that was the only good part of the book! (BAIT AND SWITCH!).    I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing his garbage now. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost it. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from pathetically weak character development (I am so apathetic toward his characters, I can't recall their names). His use of questionable and outdated physics theories, and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes makes this all but intolerable to a true sci-fi fan. I will never read anything from this former author again. 
 has some virtue, but these guys are marketeers and not writers i feel 
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 While this book contains some interesting information about Allen and his pioneering television work, it is mostly a mish-mash of stories that are not written particularly well. And I must admit that when I read one particular anecdote -- about Mrs. Sam Snead's inadvertent double entendre to Allen during a broadcast -- I began to wonder just how inaccurate the book might be. The story has also been told about Mrs. Arnold Palmer and Johnny Carson, and the urban legends web site Snopes.com says that it's not a true story. If the author of this book included urban legends, one wonders just what parts of the book are true and what parts are made up 
 All of you giving this a favorable review- are you stuck in a time warp or what? Did ya happen to notice the brilliant predictions in the book have not come true? Yeah, when have facts ever gotten in the way of the Green Nazi Agenda? Where is my aerosol can of deodorant, I got all hot after writing that?    
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
 I love to read historical fiction but this was a real dissapointment.  There was no flow to the story.  It seemed all the love scenes which were far to many and all alike, were just tied together loosely with extra verbage.  I would have liked to see the characters more fully developed.  More of a modern romance type book set in another time setting 
 I love Nigella's TV show, but was very disappointed in this book.  The format is downright confusing and the recipe directions poor.  The recipe for Barbados Cream says to mix all ingredients, but she doesn't really mean for you to mix in the brown sugar.  Recipes tell you to "beat til fairly stiff but not too stiff" (whatever that means) with no time recommendations.  She talks about simple, unpretentious food but includes some very odd ingredients and complicated directions.  There seems to be more effort put into the glib tone of the writing than into the food 
 My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.  
 Maybe viewed as a sociological document, the book can be viewed as of some value.  Ms. Tea documents about a decade of her life 14-24.  Grew up in Boston area, seemed able to run into Boston and hang out with various crowds.  Lots of drinking, living a "wild" life, I guess.  Her boyfriend Ian, with whom sex was a chore.  Moving into a lesbian life, which it almost appears she wills herself into because she does not seem to develop any sort of deep emotional attachment.  She works some; has girlfriends; Lize gets her into whoring and they become a couple.  Back and forth to Tucson a couple of times.  Denouement, of sorts.  These facts are recorded, but there seems to be little in the way of facts from which one could discern how things went this way, what caused them.  She expresses certain political views (capitalism is bad; feminism is good; environmentalism is good; etc.) but they seem to be adopted because they are politically correct among the crowd.  She seems to have few views of her own and not much in the way of guiding principles.  The book certainly does not seem to portray an attractive lifestyle; indeed, the author does not seem to enjoy much of it.  While folks may have an occasional story which would be interesting to hear, the people are not interesting nor honorable.  The life seems almost desparate, though Michelle seems to be able to plough through the life.  
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 Alan Moore pretty much took the world of superheroes, shook them upside down and inside out with his WATCHMEN book(s). WATCHMEN is something that I find myself re-reading every year or two.  When I first heard about this project, I had hopes that Moore would once again shake, rattle and roll this otherwise usually pedestrian form of comic-book.  The premise was a good one....what would happen if a court of law had to be administered to a superhero (those who so often seem to live outside or above the law).  Okay, it's ground that Stan Lee & Wally Wood covered in DAREDEVIL #7 (when Namor/Submariner wanted to file suit against the entire Human Race...and, in turn, has legal charges pressed against him).  But that was forty-some years ago....and Alan Moore is a master at the craft of comic-book writing....and this really sounded as though it had a great deal of potential.  Unfortunately one doesn't see a lot of new road paved between the DAREDEVIL #7 issue and this work.  Granted, there are some interesting twists and turns....but the work as a whole does not live up to the finer sum of its parts.  While I can appreciate Moore wanting to explore and dissect the superhero mythos that seems to have captivated generation after generation, I fear that he doesn't manage to do so with JUDGMENT DAY.    For those who truly wish to read Moore at his best, I'd give a blazing five stars to WATCHMEN or V FOR VENDETTA. This is not a book I'd use to introduce those unfamiliar with Moore's work in comic-books.  
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 I have specialized in providing professional education and therapy to divorced, courting, and re/wedded couples since 1981. I am (a) 66, (b) a stepgrandson, stepson, and ex-stepfather and stepbrother, (c) an invited Board member of the Stepfamily Association of America, (d) a contributing editor to 'Your Stepfamily Online,' and (e) the author of six personal-growth and family-relations books.  I recommend this book to readers who want a well-organized overiew of the complex premarital and re/marital counseling process. I caution readers that the authors omit several essential points which cripples the utility of their book:    1) why and how to assess and reduce co-parents' psychological wounds from childhood (vs. divorce). The authors lay the groundwork for this, but don't guide readers on how to follow through;   2) the origin and impacts of blocked grief in adults and kids, and how to spot and reduce it. There is no entry for "grief" in the book's index;   3) co-parent unawareness of five key topics: (a) normal personality formation, composition, and function; (b) keys to high-nurturance families and relationships, (c) effective communication skills, (d) healthy 3-level grief, and (e) stepfamily realities, norms, implications, and hazards. And...    4) little effective re/marital and co-parenting help (i.e. courtship coaching, classes, informed counseling, co-parent support groups) available in most communities and the media.    In my clinical experience since 1981, these factors will often block the best-intentioned adults from following relevant  re/marital and co-parenting advice. Counseling couples who are courting and re/married - specially any with existing kids - without including these factors in assessment and interventions can only be partially effective.

 I found this DVD to be very disturbing to watch as the music was obviously NOT live but a studio version badly synced with the live video. I returned it and wish I had read the Amazon reviews before buying

 "Belle de Jour" is widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. I would like to know: by whom? Certainly by nobody with high self-esteem. If art's highest purpose is to project life as it ought to be, then, according to this film's creators, life ought to be seen as dispensable, drab, meaningless, and amoral. What is virtue? "Belle de Jour" doesn't know and doesn't care. What is coherent plot and characterization? "Belle de Jour" puts on a blindfold and pins a tale on neither. What sort of role best suits a stunningly beautiful actress? "Belle de Jour" says let's stick Catherine Deneuve in a pillory of an ugly, thankless role and spit at her as a self-loathing, self-deluded prostitute. What is "Belle de Jour"? Worthless 
 This memory did not work. Still have yet to receive refund from seller 
 I was so dissapointed by this book! I read the first two and thought while they were not up to Julia London's previous books, they were light airplane reads. After 50 pages of Rachel not doing anything but letting her friends use her and eat, I was bored, bored, bored.  I only skimmed throught to see her parents moving forward.   I do not recommend this book at all 
 Why would you get this haphazard DVD with only six cartoons cut and censored, while you can get the 32 cartoon, uncut, uncensored, AND Bonus Features in the Walt Disney Treasures Series.  Save your money on this one, and look around for the Mickey Treasures.  Horrible 
 Graphics aren't the most important part of a game to me.  I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature "Oblivion" style RPG.    While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion,.. I never got to see it because of the bad controls,.. bad collision and lack of fun.  (By bad collision I'm talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects.)    The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger.  There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character.  Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease.  The controls make combat an unfun chore.    I'm a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion.  If you've never played Oblivion and don't have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it,.. then maybe you'll get into Gothic 2.  It has much lower system requirements 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 After purchasing this book I was disappointed and even insulted by the pure nature of this composition of such dreadful and unprofessional work. Perhaps it was my high expectations from such highly remarked reviews but I have never been so ashamed for purchasing a book in my life. Being a respectable professional in the environmental science field, I question how this book can help anyone out at all, with the construction of the exam today. This book will do little if any in preparation for the exam, my advice is to do more research or be prepared to waste 1 ½  hours of your life on this short and unprofessional piece of work.  
 Four months after purchase, the Receiver misfunction and shut down. It was impossible to contact Sherwood Electronics which had no service Centers in the State of Wisconsin. Therefore the warranty was not worth the piece of paper it was written on. Check out  a Sherwood Service center in your state prior to purchase 
 The central theme of this and many other books is that anyone who disagrees with or criticises the USA or its government, at home or abroad, is motivated by one or more of the following: self interest, envy or hate.[...] Facts and statistics are in short supply, unless applicable to the story line. This book is therefore entertaining proof that democratic process is, contrary to popular belief, alive and kicking in the USA. While the hysterically skewed themes of the book range from laughabley absurd to deeply offensive, it is, of course, entirely valid and relevant to have these points of view represented. I would therefore reccommend anyone who reads this book to read any of Michael Moores, for example, not to mention a few history books. After all, what's democracy anyway if you don't read and digest all sides of the story?   Further proof of the extreme political view points in the USA. Read this with a very large pinch of salt and tongue firmly in cheek, then have a cup of coffee and reflect that anyone who writes anything is only doing so to sell copies of the book and make money. Anything a politician says or does is primarily aimed at winning votes.  *Chirac was the first overseas leader to visit New York and offer sympathy on behalf of his nation after Sept 11th.  *Where are the weapons of mass destruction we were told about 
 I bought the book because I am looking for a blue water cruiser to take me round the World.  I liked the design explanations especially stability.  However I was astonished at the brevity of the section on Keels.  Less than a page on one of the most controversial aspects of blue water sailing.  The section on "Five Good Boats" is disappointing in that the boats are not widely available, apart perhaps from the Pearson. In an article in the Pearson Owners association web site the designer implicitly states the Pearson range were designed for coastal work.  There is no mention of any of the popular boats generally regarded as offshore suitable.  The author - the Technical Committee of the CCA, is no doubt a prestigious and experienced body, but it is heavily involved in racing and I think this shows.  The addition of a section on popular "offshore" boats and their strengths and weaknesses would have put my rating up to 4 stars 
 I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better 
 This is not a very good selection, all different kinds of songs thrown together. Doesn't make sense. 
 I purchased this book hoping for something comparable to Nancy Bush's excellent "Folk Socks" and was very disappointed. The designs and colourways are crude compared to the folk designs they're based on, and Lewandowski's brief accounts of folk traditions are poorly written and patronizing. The book includes some useful information on the construction of mittens, but I would not want to knit any of the patterns 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 This book is tripe.  I was forced to read it for a college class, and am disappointed by the lack of substance in the book.  While it  claims to be about tributes to fallen soldiers in Vietnam, it spends a substantial portion of the time discussing battle monuments of the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, along with an extended discussion of the dedication of the Gettysburg battlegrounds.  It looks too far into many of the objects left, such as the bike tube and nursing pads.  Frankly, I'm ashamed to be associated with the same instution as this woman.  Don't read it if you don't have to 
 In the 1960's facing the cruel conditions of institutionalization and coercive psychiatry, writers such as R.D. Laing, Ken Kesey and Thomas Szasz commented on real oppression but took a swerve in the opposite direction. As a person with mental illness, I cannot agree with what Thomas Szasz is saying. Yes medication has horrific side effects. Yes coercion is wrong.  Yes some people are diagnosed with a mental illness who have psychological problems (but in another book he is opposed to talk therapy as well, what isn't this guy opposed to?), yes some people are given medication who could do without it, yes there are new diagnoses that are not credible (road rage) but mental illness does exist. Denying mental illness and then saying the insanity defense should be eliminated because of course people did it according to their own volition (according to Szasz's reasoning) is a classic extreme libertarian viewpoint, stating firmly what is wrong but failing to come up with humanitarian alternatives. Read any book by Judi Chamberlin (a real life consumer/survivor) or track down the movie Hurry Tommorow (about the horrific conditions in an institution from the point of view of the "patients") instead of this dated, academic, dully written excercise in philosophy that detracts from the people it is supposedly championing 
 I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.  
 I read through this book and found it fairly hard to digest. It seems too "academic" for me. An amateur like me probably won't be able to get anything meaningful out of it 
 Most films don't deserve a true one star rating. You have to consider that movies are a result of hard work and at least some technique on the parts of everyone involved, and if a film fails in that department, then it has some redeeming values because it is so bad its laughable. However, Zombie Lake is a technical failure and has no redeeming values whatsoever. This film completely trashes all of the criteria that makes up a good zombie-gore movie. The zombies are of the mint-julep facial masks vareity (like Dawn of the Dead)and the closest they get to a specially designed zombie is a torn-out eyeball. The excessive nudity that makes this film mentionable is indeed excessive, but the genetalia that you get to gawk at does not belong to very pamela andersonesque women, if you know what I mean. Gore? In this movie, the few victims of zombie wrath are bitten on the neck (with the camera right behind the zombies head the whole time, obscuring the actual bite) and then after the ghoul shambles away, the camera walks around to the victim's head with a spot of cambell's tomato soup spilled nearby. Thats it, no bite wound or anything, just some soup. It probably wasn't even real Cambell's but some government issued soup that the director lifted from the Salvation Army's food bank. The plot is unimportatant (as with all zombie movies) but it is stupid and completely lacking in logic. The overall film looks and sounds like some really old educational movie, so you expect Leonard Nemoy to start narrarating it at a drop of a hat. The only reason I gave this movie an additional credit is because die hard zombie movie collecting elitists will certainly want to possese the worst example of the species.   
 Unfortunately I have not seen the movie.  I ordered the wrong version.  I wanted the one with Nicolas Cage 
 Joel Kotkin is not a professional historian.  Because of this, you can find many faults in his book.  First of all, his critique that the city can only exist on three basic principles simplifies human experience to a third grade level.  There are far more guiding principles to "what makes a successful city" other than sacredness, security, and commerce.  What about culture outside religion?  What if a nation is conquered, is that because they were not secure enough?  In World War II, was Europe under Nazi regime solely because every city in Europe was not safe?  Kotkin deliberatly skips over WWII.  Why?  Because more contemperary readers would be able to challenge his claim.  In his discussion of Athens, I am doubtful he even read Thucydides.  He argues Athens was not secure.  Then how did they defeat Persia?  Why did Athens form the Delian League for, if not for Security?  This was "overlooked" in his analysis.  Furthermore, his critique on Russia not being sacred in Soviet times is nothing more than old Cold War jargon.  Did Russian history and culture vanish in 1917?  NO.  It did not.  Sure, the Orthodox faith went underground, but religion is not all culture.  St. Petersburg, Petrograd, or Leningrad, whatever you called the city, was the same thing.  Changing its name did not destroy what it was.  I have never written a review here, but this book needs a critique that will prevent others from wasting their time.  The City offers no new insights.  It offers nothing but a repititious read of the same drawn out conclusions made by the author over and over and over again.  If you read this book, hopefully it is because you were forced to, and not because you wanted to 
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 I'm in the process of planning a wedding in Jamaica and was hoping for some suggestions. The basics are covered in the book but it is from 1995.  It suggests going to the library and travel agents for help and brouchures.  It would have been nice if it mentioned the internet at all.  It is geared toward inexperienced travelers. Overall I wouldn't recommend it only because the information can be found through any wedding site 
 Because of the title and other factors I was expecting a non-religious approach to alcoholism.  But that is not what this book is.  It is the story of one guy who didn't think he could possibly be an alcoholic, and how after some ups and downs discovered that he wanted to stop drinking and found great value in AA.  He avoids discussing Christianity but a big part of his story is his improved relationship with what he calls God.    In other words, reading this book is a lot like just going to an AA meeting, where people every day tell the same story.  As such, the book has value in the same way AA has value.  And on those terms it is moderately useful, even including chapters in which some third parties tell their drinking stories, just like in AA.  But in terms of rationality, this is no more a "thinking person's" book than any other.  If you're looking for a secular book on alcohol recovery, keep looking 
 There are a number of errors in this textbook, not just in the end-of-chapter review problems, but also in the chapter Examples  that are meant to explain them. This does little to allow students to quickly and easily grasp the material.  The writing style makes an interesting novel but a lousy textbook. Material is presented by giving an example, history and finally the scientific concept meant to be grasped. Makes for a great mystery, but this is science and a subject that scares students anyway. A concept given first is seldom followed by a thorough explanation. The effect is one of an author, who know his material really well, has no idea how to convey the basics to his readers and is trying hard to entertain. Combine this with the smattering of factual errors and this textbook is just annoying 
 I have progressively become more and more disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's books in the past decade. Her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- Southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. Blessedly, "Whisker of Evil" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. Rita Mae Brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of Virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only Virginians understand these things. That's just simply not true.  That said, there were some delightful aspects of "Whisker of Evil" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters were adorable as ever, and I loved learning more about Harry as a person and what makes her tick. Her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. I liked reading more about her home and her relationships. However, the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of Rita Mae Brown's fan base? It was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too far and I found myself skipping pages. As well, I almost threw the book across the room when I came across a line that stated in so many words that only Virginians have manners. This is a common theme of Ms. Brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. There is a big, big world outside of Virginia -- Rita Mae Brown should know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. I would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. Enough already about Southern manners (a biased perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and horse), and foxhunting.   Whatever happened to characters like Celeste Chalfonte 
 Q: So was the mega-successful, multi-platinum Rock/Hip-Hip crossover masterpiece `One Fierce Beer Coaster' the Bloodhound Gang's first album? A: No, it wasn't. The band's first album was `Use Your Fingers', released in 1995.  Q: So how come I've never heard of it? A: You haven't been looking in the bargain bin at your local record store.  Q: Was it any good? A: The record-buying public didn't seem to think so, and neither did the band. Bloodhound Gang actually split up after the release of `Use Your Fingers' because of the poor response it received, but reformed again.  Q: So what's the title all about then? Is it referring to Guns n Roses or female masturbation? A: Yes to both.  Q: So what's it sound like? A: It sounds just how you might imagine the predecessor to `One Fierce Beer Coaster' would sound.  Q: So it's got the funky beats then? A: Er, sort of.  Q: And it's got the silly lyrics? A: Yes.  Q: And the dumb bits between the songs? A: Of course it does. It's a Bloodhound Gang album isn't it?  Q: And does the CD have some dumb instructions on it? A: Yes! These questions are really dumb!  Q: Sorry, but I'm doing my best. There are lots of obscure references to American pop culture here. Can you help me out? A: I'll try...  Q: Is that really Rip Taylor on the first track? A: Yes, it is.  Q: So who's Rip Taylor? A: A camp American comedian, famous for being fat, having spiky hair, throwing confetti when he tells jokes, and being camp. Also known as the Prince of Pandemonium.  Q: Who are Vera, Flo and Mel? A: All three are characters from the sitcom "Alice". Vera and Flo are waitresses, while Mel is the cook who owns Mel's Diner.  Q: Who are Jerry's Kids, and why do they need a sponsor? A: Comedian Jerry Lewis got all serious when he started getting old, and started a charity for disabled children. The children helped by the charity are known as Jerry's Kids.  Q: What was the Rockford Files? A: It was a 1970s police show starring James Garner.  Q: What are spaghettios? A: Little rings made of spaghetti, shaped like the letter O.  Q: What was Barbara Eden doing in a bottle? A: She was Jeannie in the sitcom "I Dream Of Jeannie", where she was a genie who lived in a bottle. Look, this is getting boring. Ask some questions about the music!  Q: Er, OK, I'll try. Um, did Bloodhound Gang write all the music? A: Of course not! They ripped stuff off all over the place and covered Kim Wilde's "Kids In America". However, The Cure wouldn't let them rip off a sample, which is probably a good thing, because this album is bad enough on it's own.  Q: Is it as good as Lawnmower Deth's "Kids In America"? A: No.  Q: Is "One Way" a Blondie cover, "Go Down" an AC/DC cover, and "No Rest For The Wicked' an Ozzy Osbourne cover? A: No.  Q: Are any of the songs clever and funny? A: No, but some are stupid and funny, like `You're Pretty When I'm Drunk', and he's pretty ...ing drunk.  Q: So what else can you tell us about the music? A: That's a stupid question! Um, well, it sounds like the demo tunes on tinny little hand held keyboards, but it took five guys to make the sounds. Occasionally a guitar pops up, but not often enough.  Q: So, um, is this like, any good, or worth getting? A: It depends. If you like other Bloodhound Gang albums, then you might like this. If you are just a casual observer, who quite liked "Fire Water Burn" then you'd probably be very disappointed.  Q: So it's rubbish then. A: I wouldn't go quite that far, but it's not a masterpiece. Finished with the questions?  Q: Yes. A: Good. 
 When used as a self-study text, I found the book to be lacking a sufficient quantity of example problems solved in adequate detail to be truly helpful 
 This phone is not all smiles and laughing and gumdrops:  the mute button makes me crazy.  Oh, the phone is all "la la la I love its range and clarity," as other users report, but my face hits the Mute button as I talk.  Unaware that my calls are muted, conversations break down into two kids with crappy walkie-talkies:  "Hello?  Hey, you there?  Hello?!"  I don't suffer from Fat Face, nor am I mashing the handset to my cheek.  The phone is otherwise excellent.  But I'm going to destroy mine 
 Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words.  A discard.  Not National Book Award Material 
   God, this movie was....lame. I mean, it was lame. It limped; it struggled, it staggered.   I lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes.  The really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed? Check. The sleazeball guy getting killed? Check. The sleazeball guy practically begging for death? "Here, doggie..."?  That's eighty minutes of my life I'll never get back.  
 This book is a pice of crap. Is a construction paper catalog with a few words!!! 
 The Quaran is very complex, and is interpreted wrongly more times than not. If one is not an EXPERT on the quarun, the TRUE meaning of the quaran in arabic AND THE REAL FACTS ABOUT PROPHET MOHAMMED'S (peace be apon him) LIFE AND CHARACTER, then one should shut their ignorant mouths (no offence).This book sugests that Mohemmed (peace be apon him) was evil! Is this the same Mohemmed who condemed his followers for burning down a church and rebuilt it? I do not pretent to be an expert, but i also know that the author of this book and those that have written +ive reviews certainly are not. Ignorance like this is what is the cause of evil in the world and the cause of any muslims, christians, jews or any other human commiting unjust attrocities. Surely the sheer stupidity of this book is immediatly highlighted in its summery! To critize islam, the quarun and Mohammed (peace be apon him)using those 'muslims' past and present who have wrongly interpreted it (as this book does) or used it as a tool for power and commited atrocious crimes, as evidence is ridiculous. Humans from all faiths and races have done equally bads things. How stupid would it be to hold the holacaust agaist all germans forever. This book is up there with Hitlers 'Mein Kamph'!  
 I am a huge Bukowski fan but this book seemed to list stories and events in a very akward manner. It had great detail and I learned alot about Buk but if given the chance I would have rather have read 15 essays on Charles  Bukowski then have to read this book again 
 Supposed to be great. Critics loved it. So original. I thought it was boring and annoying. A collection of short stories about unlikable people, a lot of gibberish that was intentionally unintelligible. Which is fine for a while, but an entire book is too much. I really disliked it. I applaud any attempt to do something completely different, so I give it two stars instead of one, but jabbing knitting needles into my eye sockets would be different too, and I wouldn't like that much either 
 I was looking for the instrumental version of Tim McGraw's song for a project I was working on and purchased the CD just for the song... It wasn't there.  Not very happy 
 I was hoping that this book would give me a solid introduction to home improvement but it really didn't deliver.  The information presented tended to be either too brief or assumed a lot of proir knowledge, which is inappropriate in a book with "for Dummies!" in the title.  There were some good tips but I never had enough info to embark on a project with only this book as a reference.  One exception was the info on painting, which was helpful and detailed. Also, a lot of the material seemed a little dated - there was tons of info about wallpapering and installing laminate countertops (I think these options are not as popular as they once were) but not much on installing granite counters or laminate flooring.  So, in short, having this book is better than nothing but if you really want to be well versed in home improvement, look elsewhere.   
 A perfect selection to augment the University of Louisville Library system-wide single book collection "Dumb and Dumber: Get Down Dumb". Also highly recomended on advanced review, Pitino's forethcoming "The Red Headed Stepchild University That Just Quite Couldn't&quot 
 Richard Roeper is the worst thing to happen to movies since the corporate take-over of the studios in the 1980's. He cares far more about celebrities, his own image, and behind the scenes gossip than he does for any film. Whereas a good critic would find ways to help people love movies (or any artform) more, Roeper almost never does this, choosing instead to focus on the most negative elements of many of the films he writes about. Even the descriptions above, by the publisher, highlight this fact: he writes about "Reviews of Hollywood finance." (Rather than encouraging people to care more about the story than the budget.) "Actors who appear in television commercials." Does Roeper want us to focus on who does commercials, or focus on each movie, and decide whether its story is told well or not? Citing two unsuccessful films, Roeper proposes a "moratorium on pet projects." But Roeper wants to oversimplify films so he can snarkily make his point, when he ignores the reality that many, many successful (i.e., well-told) films are "pet projects." Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, or Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ are two strong (and very different) examples. But Roeper just wants to dumb everything down (including the movies and movie audience) for his jokey complaints. I do believe that this very shallow man loves movies, but he uses a tremendous amount of power and energy encouraging and teaching people to utterly dismiss entire movies because of one or two irrelevant elements. A quick example: When the film "Chicago" was in theatres, Roeper nearly bent himself double complaining fiercely about the fact that the movie wasn't filmed in Chicago - EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT IS ON THE SCREEN. I heard him being interviewed on a radio show, and the host was scoffing at "Chicago," saying that he wouldn't go see a musical. Rather than stepping into the role of film critic and defending the film as sexy and fun (Roeper gave a thumbs up to it), Roeper merely complained about the location of the shoot again, and never said another word about it. Disgraceful. This book is NOT, "a love letter to film." It is a course in learning how to diminish and dismiss film, our greatest artform 
 I left behind my D-link DWL 132 (108 mbps) when I was on vocation which work great for me over a year. After read all the reviews, I decided to give this one (WUSB54GS a try).  The signal range was dispointed (D-Link DWL132 have much better range).  Setup with push button with Linksys Secure Easy Setup is easy with Linksys router, BUT I lost connection on my other Laptop PC which is not Linksys wireless adapter. I go back to re-setup my laptop than this adapter on desk top lost connection because of changing setting on the linksys router. One way or another, I spend 4 hours still unable to make both adapters work with Linksys 54g router. 
 The 2002 version of the Star Wars core rulebook is an improvement over the original.  It upgrades some underpowered character classes, adds some breadth, and makes much-needed improvements to the very abstract and annoying vehicle operation system used in the 1999 rulebook.  Unfortunately, the central, crippling problem with the 1999 version remains:  the d20 system just isn't well-suited to Star Wars storytelling.  Playing this game is nothing like playing out a Star Wars story, and a lot like playing Dungeons and Dragons in space.  Star Wars is fast-moving, fluid, and dynamic, and not much concerned with power balance.  A kid fresh off the moisture farm can fight his way past elite enemy troops to save the princess, and one Sith Lord can arrange the downfall of the entire Jedi order.  Audacity and heroic (or villainous) attitudes matter more than experience and number-crunching.  Major characters rarely die, and then only if there's a strong dramatic reason for it.  Plotlines are loose and free-form.  A game based on Star Wars should reflect that.  By contrast, d20 is very cut-and-dried, and very regulated, and much too lethal.  Concepts like "level", "class", and "hit points" are fundamental to the d20 system, but are not very applicable to the Star Wars universe.  The system has a lot going for it, and it's great for Dungeons and Dragons, but here it's a case of trying to stuff a square peg into a round hole.  I prefer the West End Games "d6" version released in the late 1980s.  It has its flaws - it doesn't deal with very powerful characters as well as it might, and character creation could use some tuning (particularly for Force-sensitive PCs) - but it captures the feel of Star Wars.  A revision of that rule system, or a completely new system incorporating the best features of both d6 and d20, would have been a much better choice than using the d20 system as a "one-size-fits-all" set of mechanics.  However, it seems unlikely that Wizards of the Coast will forsake their flagship d20 system for something as high-profile as Star Wars.  So I suggest that if you really want to get into gaming in the Star Wars universe, look for a used copy of the West End Games version 
 This may very well be the worst product I've ever purchased.  It was bad to the extent that I will probably never again purchase a Homedics product.  I previously owned a foot massager (not Homedics) with water jets, etc., that did a decent job of relieving my foot, heel and arch pain. The problem was that it decided to spring a leak one day and made a huge mess.  I decided to try this product because I didn't want to get involved in the water situation again.  I wasn't that concerned with the speed of the massagers slowing down when I put my feet on them.  The speed of them was inconsequential as long as they were at least moving.  About 20 minutes after I started using it, I realized that the infrared function on the left side of the unit had stopped working.  I tried to turned it off and on a few times and then I let it sit awhile, but it wouldn't come back on.  Later, after I had the unit turned off for a couple of hours, I tried to turn it on again and NOTHING worked except the right side's infrared.  The left side's infrared AND the massagers were no longer operating.  I have never experienced a product that was made so poorly that it ceased to function after less than an hour of usage.  On the plus side, I thought that the Amazon return process was extremely easy and customer-friendly.  I requested a refund on this product.  There is no way I'd try another one after this experience 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 I've read many books on PKI and there are not many good ones out there.  This one used to be the best among some very awful books, which wasn't saying much.  It was excellent on covering the standards of PKI such as they exist, but otherwise said very little about installation, layout, protocols, and design, common problems, and real world solutions.  Most of what they said was repeated multiple times throughout the book.  Sometimes even on the very next paragraph.  They took two/three pages just to say that the top down approach to PKI planning is better than slapping in a service just to support a single product.  Stating the obvious didn't win any points with me.  They discussed outdated or barely used protocols like SET, and didn't bother getting in depth at all with protocols that are in use like SSL.  They discussed Single Sign On like a simple PKI install will solve all our problems, completely missing the outstanding problem of vendor interoperability.  Active Directory and PKI are only mentioned in passing with no operational details.  Get Klaus Schmeh's book or the Housley book instead 
 I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating 
 This has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The characters are pointless and one-dimensional. The guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy. They have sudden fights over apparently nothing. In fact, there is no cause-and-effect in this movie at all! Things just happen randomly for no apparent reason. There's no real story. The takes are boring; most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing. The violent ending wasn't even believable! Instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy, I was left just thinking "what the...???" Really, really pointless all around 
 I guess I hated it more than I loved it, although parts of it were interesting and the ending was intriquing.  I can't decide if it was worth plodding through all the slow parts, boring love letters, and characters I can't identify with because I identify with the loyal spouse at home being cheated (physically or emotionally) on by a self-absorbed Thomas.  Since I can't decide, it deserves only 2 stars.  I had to search online to try to see if I understood the ending.  The backward story-telling was confusing, but makes sense in light of the ending.  Overall, I don't think this book is worth the effort.  I still hope to find other books as good as The Pilot's Wife 
 I did watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse back when it was in theaters & I rather enjoyed it! this movie, I just got to today & found myself wondering what the hell happened. the movie is just so much stupider then the second one. I found myself laughing at parts where we're "supposed to be scared". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles. 
 I still haven't finished this book.  It's repetitiveness make it hard to pick up for more than a few pages at a time.    Some of the reported facts are quite interesting, but the same scenarios are repeated over and over as "new" evidence of The Problem With Hillary (or HILLARY, if you will).  If the book was a quarter of its actual length it might be a good read.  Also, I still have not figured out why Dick Morris is going after Hillary (other than her obvious character flaws which he does a decent job of revealing in the book).  He stuck by the Clinton's even after being physically assaulted by Bill - so what is the real reason behind his poison pen toward HILLARY.  This isn't his only book about her.  Did something go terribly wrong between he and the former First Family late in their relationship?  Is he just trying to capitalize on his former connections with the Clinton's purely for monetary gain?  Did he like, or at least tolerate, Bill and is now exposing Hillary (and to a lesser exrent Bill) only since that the Clinton presidency is over?  I agree with his apparent opinion of Hillary, but this is just a very poorly organized, overly-repetitive book.  I'd advise checking it out from the library, but it's not worth spending money on 
 Bob Dylan has said on multiple occasions that he has never liked the great acclaim he's been given nor the title "Voice of a Generation", and so produced crappy albums to silence the fanatics.  Yeah, this would be one of them.  Dylan meets '80's synth?  The result is . . . it's terrifying 
 This game is so full of bugs that it can't be played on the average computer.  It lags and stutters badly.  Even after several patches there is no improvement 
 Santa brought hello kitty this past christmas.  Hello Kitty is my daughter's favorite. It was going to be the best gift ever - instead it was her greatest disappointment. The mikes, music and lights were going to be amazing.  The one santa brought never worked so we contacted target and they sent a new one.  Well that worked maybe a day. We figured the drain on batteries was so great that it couldn't run for long so we bought an adapter - which it didn't come with (12.99).  Didn't help - doesn't work so now I have 2 broken hello kitty cd players and an adapter. We spent @$105.00. including batteries and adapter for this. 
 Ethan Walker's "The Mystic Christ" does NOT AT ALL understand or explain the REAL Jesus Christ.  I'll return this literature as soon as I get the chance. It's completely bogus (with very little truth to it)I mean this man totally misunderstands the plan for redemption, what real love is meant by Christ, and any other reality pertaining to Christ.  If you want to understand Christ, TRULLY, then learn about Him from St. Francis of Assisi, St. John of the cross, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Vincent Ferrer, Fr. Reginald Garrigou - Lagrange, Dom Vitalis, Henry Manning, St. Thomas Aquinas, Sister Josepha Menendez,. Etc....These days it's very popular to twist and distort Jesus Christ by saying Lo here is "A" Christ and Lo there is "A" Christ.  This book lacks in real knowledge of Christ.  While some of this litarature has good points (not on Christ of course but on Buddha and Krsna,etc it does) it really only shows the authers lack of understanding Jesus' real plan and reason for His Incarnation.  The book should have been called "The Mystic Life" and NOT "The Mystic Christ".  Totally misleading and insulting toward Christ (Not "THE" or "A" Christ)....  If you want to be mislead then read this book.  If you want to be lead in the correct path then read "The Way Of Divine Love" by Sister Josepha Menendez if you really want to know THE REAL Jesus Christ (There is no Lo here and Lo there and there is no word "THE" and letter "A" in Christ). Do not fall for this sort of Neuro-Linquistic Programming... 
 When I read this book in college, I thought of myself as a progressive thinker. The philosophy I read in the book was so twisted and exaggerated, it began a long, slow and comprehensive change in my entire paradigm of policital thinking 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I bought this book because it was touted as the "bible" at many of the financial seminars and wealth seminars that I attended.  I believe in the concept of the book, but it is outdated, repetitive and boring.  I have been carrying the book around with me for over a month now, half read, and only read from it when I can not find a free newspaper at the train station 
 if it is one thing i hate in a book it's a gimmick. gimmick writing is almost never clever or interesting or good, it is simply a gimmick. the gimmick here is that mr amis writes the novel backwards. the story, all dialogue, everything is backward. end to beginning, this, like all gimmicks, gets real tiresome, real fast. years ago i read mr amis's book "money," which i loved. i have been looking forward to reading more of him, so this came as a great disappointment. don't waste your time 
 I owned this cookbook for two yearnow, and cooked many of the recipes from each section; It seems that most of these recipes were just thoughtlessy typed up and bound together.  Did Cynthia Nims actually cook anything out of here herself?  Expect to cook each recipe multiple times to adjust cooking times and get a handle on prep times which can balloon out of proportion.  These recipes are from restaurants so expect large amounts of heavy cream and butter in everything.  Also, expect to search for at least one or two ingredients in every recipe.  A quick example:  "Hazelnut French Toast" sounds easy and delicious right?  Well have fun driving to Langely, WA for a loaf of artisan hazelnut bread.  Of course you could substitute a "rustic country bread" but then you would have "Rustic Country French Toast".  That's just idiotic in my opinion.  Thanks to the chefs who've created some wonderful sounding dishes, and bullocks to Nims for profiting off her rubish editing.  You're better off going to these restaurants, which is probably what this book is...a glorified advertisement 
 This Suduko handheld game was not user friendly. I returned it for a full refund 
 For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
 This book is good about listing the objectives and showing you exactly where to find the answers for the multiple choice questions.  For example: What is the purpose of a job cost sheet? The book highlights the area where the answer is.  Easy huh?  Well, what about the actual accounting problems?  The detailed problems at the end of each chapter have NO SOLUTIONS to them, and you can't buy a solutions guide unless you are an instructor!  I'm not an accounting wizard, so I have to actually practice before it sticks in my brain... imagine that.  I guess they expect everyone to see the problems and read about the problems and automatically get it.  They work out a "Demonstration Problem" for you, but that only applies to some of the problems at the end of each chapter.

 The Buddha didn't want to be worshipped and no reliable historical account of him exists. The whole book is speculation. If you want to study buddhism read a book about buddhism not this book 
 Anyone gushing over the "concerned and loving" parent's of Terri Shiavo really needs to read Michael Shiavo's book on the life and death of his wife. Unlike "Terri's Family," he uses real documents, court and hospital records to support his case. He also exposes the Shindler's (in particular, Bob), as being much less concerned with their their daughter's treatment and more more concerned with affording a bigger condo.  Terri is finally resting in peace 
 This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it.  And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
 Let's start with Outlook interface.  These are the exact words from their user manual:  "ACT! 2007 E-mail will work through Microsoft Outlook versions 2000, 2002 (XP) or 2003."  So those of us with newer versions of Outlook cannot synch the Outlook email or calendar with Act.  What's the point?  Then what are you supposed to synch with your Blackberry - Outlook so you can get your calendar and email information or Act so you can get your client database. The Act email is so basic and primitive looking, you  can't put attractive auto signatures on it.  Then they tell you that you can have one month of telephone support, but it's only available during work days, not on the weekends.  Since I purchased the product on the weekend, I won't be able to speak with someone to ask for a full refund until Monday.  I've used this product for 24 hours and I'm giving up.  What a waste of time and money.  How does this company survive with such a bad product?    If anyone knows of a good CRM program for a small business, please share.      
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 If you ever wonder why energy workers are stereotyped as newagey, flaky, and also inprecise in how they define energy, i.e. they say energy is in everything, you won't wonder after you read this book. I picked this up on a whim, curious to see if it really offered a break through in energy healing.  There is nothing innovative about this book. You can find the concepts the author discusses in books on taoism and tantra that are better written and have a better explanation.  I tried his exercises out and found them to be not nearly as effective as he promised. If anything it seemed this was more like a diet lite soda than anything that promised a break through. I wouldn't really recommend this book 
 although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead 
 I am considering opening my own spa and I bought this book based on the publisher's review that it has everything to "build and operate a profitable business". I have an MBA and 10 years of management consulting experience, so for me this book was a collection of the common sense business basics and generalities instead of the spa operations insights. It is definitely not worth its price ($69). For those who are in my shoes, I would suggest to buy one of the business publications available from the ISPA or learn industry trends from www.hfdspa.com and many SPA publications 
 I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out the anti-social nature of the author. I also agree that the author's self "selling points" are simply a modern copy of the "emperor's new clothes".   I noticed that majority of the posters claimed that this "master's text" is incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, I believe that the entire book are just the psychotic rambling. So why bother even to read it!?  
 There is surprisingly not much of sniping in the memoirs.  The only really impressive fact from the book - the guy was a self-taught sniper (at least during the first few months of his career) who was smart enough to keep a low profile in a presence of real snipers from the other side.  Yet he was lucky enough to stay alive and score high (well, this was no wonder considering the number of targets available, but still). What is really annoying - all these pitiful attempts to use Soviets' atrocities as a justification not only for his own actions (that is understandable but still annoying) but for the whole German cause at the end of the war.  As far as I know nazis were no saints themselves and I find it hard to believe that the main character did not know what exactly they did not only to Russian POWs but to a civilian population as well. Quite the opposite - somehow his and his comrades' interractions with Russian civilians are strangely omitted from his memoirs. In any case I was intended to buy a book about sniping and not somthing like "Atrocities of WWII - real or imaginary 
 HOOGIE MANE FACE UR FACTOR FOR ON JUST DROP SHY CHINAMAN UP TO  DANC 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 I bought this book a few years ago on the recommendation of a professor of labor history.  History is often told from the point of view of the "winners", so I thought it would be good to absorb a perspective that is not usually taught.  I admit that all history is a form of narrative, and there are no "pure" facts in history since all narratives make value judgments at least implicitly.  But some narratives "work" better than others; some narratives enshrine values that would be better for us to hold than others.  Some ways of understanding the past are more helpful, and thus more correct, than others.  The narrative presented in this book is not very helpful for the same reason that ruling-class narratives are unhelpful: both are heroic narratives.  The only difference is that those who play the role of hero and those who play the marginalized have switched places.  History is far too complex of a process - of a story - to say that "so-and-so was responsible for such-and-such".  In this case, we learn that poor laborers, minorities, women, and immigrants are "really" responsible for America's accomplishments.  Of course, this is partially correct, for it is surely the case that we would not be where we are were it not for these groups.  But to imply that educated white men - people like two of the authors of the book themselves - made little "real" contribution to America's accomplishments but instead were responsible for all of our social failings is preposterous.  This is simply a swing of the pendulum to the opposite extreme.  In fact, I think that the whole project of parcelling out persons into groups, and then telling a group-based historical narrative is problematic.  Which group defines your identity?   The failing of this book is that it mistakes the the part for the whole, the necessary for the sufficient.  A much better narrative that includes the marginalized and the working class can be found in Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*.    I gave the book two stars instead of one because the writing is quite good - just like an absorbing historical fiction 
 I'd write a review for this sewage, but Kevin did it so perfectly that I'd be wasting my time. The only decent one of these bunch of horrible adaptations was Silent Hill, and even that one lacked the greatness of the video game. And now, there's a Spyhunter movie coming out? WTF is next? Prince of Persia (...please don't do that one, I was only kidding!)?  Get the video games for the real thing 
 "Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood."  This is a direct quote.  It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go. 
 This book is a waste of paper.  Little to no useful information or insight into wedding traditions in Scotland.  Dull 
 White author Andrew Hacker mercilessly flays Whites and shamelessly sucks up to Blacks. 'Two Nations' is for Whites who want to feel guilty about being White, and Blacks who want to blame their troubles on Whites. For  people truly interested in race and culture, I recommend buying Thomas  Sowell's 'Race and Culture' . . . and returning this book to your public  library 
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 The Oracle9i JDBC Programming book is better 
 I not fan of Linsay Lohan but also have nothing against her acting... didn't had... I bought this movie just to enjoy some nice movie, but i was SO wrong.. this movie is absolutely stupid... and very disappointing.  I just watched Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, well there's 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life that I'll never get back! Truly Appalling. It didn't make sense. It didn't flow. It was totally unbelievable. It had terrible characters. It had a terrible script, and possibly worst of all they tried to make it into a musical type thing...very unwise!  Avoid at all costs if u favour your sanity, it's boring, predictable and badly written 
 this book comes with a kit thats not worth the price. it has templets that are more time consuming, you'd rather buy the quick and easy paper punches. this book is good for primary school children. not for somone who's looking at making serious cards. wat a waste of money 
 Serious Concerns is an 87 page collection of self-indulgent, cynical jabs at the publishers and commissioners, as well at the reader and at other poets.  It is one big in-joke that belongs in a very small circle in a  depressed part of Britain 
 I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no 
 There is no scholarship in the book, a few reference that are minimally supportive to his cause. The premise of the book is that Agriculture hijacked civilization 10,000 years ago.  Hijacked!!! How do you prove that one?  He believes ALL agriculture is detrimental, including organic.  He asks us to go back to hunting and gathering in the form of "perenial polyculture" and describes the satisfaction of a Buffalo hunt in a farmers field. He believes (no proof at all) that hunter gatherers had sensory abilities that make us moderns practically robotic. Are we victims of agriculture? - there is a real arrogance here for the reader, who apparently is too ignorant to see what has happened. This author has not got a clue what it meant to be a hunter gatherer, and there is little description of their lifestyle other than how the author feels when he goes out hunting.This is real belief in and grief for the loss of the garden of eden. It is written like a expose, a conspiracy of the elite( probably started by a female), who just wanted to keep slaves and accumulate wealth.  This is a real disservice to people trying to improve/reform and innovate in agriculture. It should have no stars at all(that option did not seem to be available) and I would not have read it, if it had not been choosen by my bookclub 
  did not like this movie,except for the acting which was it's only redeeming quality. this movie jumps all over the place and after a while i just gave up trying to follow it,although i did watch it to the end,hoping it would end up making sense.boy was i wrong.was never so happy to see end credits roll. i do not recommend this movie unless you are one of those people who can keep track of ten things at once.if you are,you'll love it.otherwise don't waste your time 
 Once in a while a person accidentally stumbles on an especially annoying book. One written particularly because a desperate publisher made a phone call, or mailed a letter with a check to an author with the words: "It's time to write another one, Shirley..." and the author hurled herself to write, without a plan, without ideas and the only thing that came out was a dull diary filled with self pity, anti-Americanism, sexism and generally criticism... Well, this is one of those books and I truly feel sorry for the trees that have to die annually to satisfy the erroneous marketing projections of underpaid book editors in the current cost-cutting environment (especially after the advent of Print-on-Demand) in order to deliver such hideous and mind numbing gems. Yet I am also grateful. I'm grateful for these sacrifices because they serve to carry a message to the reader, which he or she can carry to you the broader audience. That message is - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK AND THIS AUTHOR.  In terms of content - well, there is no story here. This is simply a tedious account of a lonely woman who spent someone else's money to visit Antarctica and record her daily experiences. What kind of experiences, you wonder?  The kind that go like this"  "...we took off over the frozen sound toward the Transantarctics..." "...we could see individual birds waddling about with stones in their beaks..." "...Later that day we landed at the snout of the Mawson Glacier for a picnic..." "...so we all had our own few feet of privacy. It was hot and dark inside..." "...and later we saw all their small yellow tents pitched in the distance..."  and go on and on and on...  Occasionally the author makes references to Scott's, Shackleton's and other expeditions, but in no way enough to stir imagination or interest. I doubt you'd learn anything new from this book.  If you are truly interested about Antarctica, the history behind the conquests and a first person account of the harshness of the pole and its frozen lands, check out "Race to the Pole: Tragedy, Heroism, and Scott's Antarctic Quest" by Ranulph Fiennes.  Yield to reason - ignore this one.  - by Simon Cleveland 
 The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy 
 she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls!   PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!   Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one! 
 windschuttle is a small minded right wing hack.  this is the latest of his partisan efforts that attempt to mask shrill biased rantings as thoughtful academic analysis.  in short, windschuttle is a fraud, a poser, and a puppet for a dangerous ideology.    look no further than his denial of australian history.  a history which includes the elimination of indigenous peoples, which windschuttle denies.  he is a complete and utter apologist for far right "conservative" caucasians.  all his long winded ponderings eventually fall on the side of those who look like him, and share his economical and foreign policy views.  please don't be fooled by the apparent intelligence of a very disturbed and biased man.  
 This book is only an overview of topics, none of the topics are discussed in detail, so if you just depend on this one book to pass the exam, it is not going to work. The sample problems and other topics make assumptions  without reference to where they came from. As long as you have other texts  or good notes from your courses, this book is O 
 When I first signed up for the theory of computation I expected it to be a great class. I had looked over some of the subject material before the course started and it found it very interesting. I mean, who can't find this subject interesting? Learning about not only how computers function but what their limitations are. I'll tell you who, anyone who has had the misfortune of reading this book. I don't know how or why two obviously educated people can write a book that is so lackluster. This book turned my course into an absolute nightmare. I instead turned to another book, which ended up saving me. Do yourself a favor and run from this book as fast as you can 
 The author chose a very important topic, but he's attacking straw men throughout the entire thing. He complains about religious people who supposedly use isolated Bible quotes to endorse poverty's existence, and then he spends a half-chapter piling on the Bible quotes to say why we should act. I agree we should act and the Bible says we should act, but I could do with a little less condescension. No religious person uses the Bible to argue in favor of poverty. Who on earth does the author think he's arguing against?    He says there's a problem, and we all agree with that, but then he assumes that the existence of poverty somehow predetermines the particular solutions he recommends.  He fails to conclusively link the causes of poverty with those solutions.  Knowing how someone fell into a hole does not provide sufficient information about how to get them out of the hole.  Repeating the same assertions a dozen times is not the same as a reasoned argument.  The author needs to realize that people don't differ much about whether poverty is bad. They disagree on how to reduce it, and the author does not address these other opinions much.  Instead we get a lot of caricature of religious people and conservatives 
 I was looking for good links for online activities, tutorials, and classes but found way too many dead links, pseudo 5 star sites that were sales sites, and too many Bible links. I compared a Google search for the topic headings and did much better than scouring the book for viable links. Don't waste your money or time 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 The book was a fare read. After applying the strategies and adding some belief I expected some positive results. However, as is true of most books like this, it all resulted in nothing but a let down. The second part of the book is about starting a mail-order business from your kitchen table. That didn't work either, as it costs more time and money than was indicated. I guess this book was written when people lived simpler lives and a dollar was worth a dollar. The book probably sold very well by mail-order. I guess if you write your own book on mail-order and find a way to promote it so today's society will bite, you too could take the lazy man's way to riches. Lots of luck 
 this joke book suks. if i can give it any star i want, i would give it a -10 stars. i never actually bought it, but i borrowed it from a friend. i needed a joke book for my anouncements on the intercom every morning, and it only lasted 3 days and i ran out of good jokes. some of the jokes arnt appropriate and most of them dont make sense. if your gonna buy a joke book, dont buy this 
 I bought this as a large print book for my mother-in-law who has trouble with her vision.  This is NOT large print  She did enjoy the stor 
 Other than a mindless beach read, this book was a big disappointment.  The main character was silly and immature -- and should I add spoiled rotten.  The plot was very contrived.  The timing was unrealistic -- imagine trying to come up with an investigative story of this magnitude within a week -- give me a break!  I don't think I will plan to read later books in the series, unless I am truly bored stiff 
 This movie was not only stupid, but it also stained the MI series with a huge inconsistant sequal. The storyline is just plain shaky. Tom Cruise was NOT the Ethan hunt that he was in the first one. He turned into some into some guy who laughs at everything, he lost ALL of his charm that he had in the first movie. This was a TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! The characters were so differnet then the first one, and gosh the worst part of this movie was how inconsistant it was from the first one. Only buy this if you absolutly  have to, but let me warn you, it is a WASTE!! 
 This story has no redeeming value at all.  The primary character is portrait as a Fat Slob who cannot do anything of significant.  Not only is his life a waste, but this story is a waste. Do NOT buy it 
 As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel. Sadly, I was deeply disappointed by this pompous, self-indulgent, virtually unreadable monster. The cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70-something Italian librarian.    
 I learn from my experience if only a handful of people rated 5 stars don't believe it.  I only read 15% of this book, and it is really really borring. I didn't laugh one bit.  This book say if I am not laughing than I don't have humor.  That's a lame excuse for a boring book.  If this is really 5 stars, I can write a 10 stars book for people to laugh at intelligent and witty jokes, not stupid unlaughable joke like this book.  But, Amazon is way cool, 5 stars bookstore.  I have bought quite a few books (> 50) at Amazon, and I will continue to buy it.  Recommend: I did laugh with for better or for worst by Lynn Johnston.  Clean and witty whole some family jokes.  Judy Carter is also very funny.  These two ladies are way cool  
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 Sharing the sentiments of the two previous posters, I think this book is a disappointment.  For example, the second macro model presented by Romer -- the Ramsey-Cass-Koopman model -- is absent of optimal control theory.  Setting up the Hamiltonian and showing how to dervive the Euler's equation of the optimal consumption path of the representative consumer would be a better treatment of the topics.  This book, I think, lacks basic techincal tools essential for econ Ph.D. students.  I am a microeconomist-wanna-be, this book makes me wonder what on earth is macroeconomics -- something very mysterious to me.  Who are going to write a better text for graduate-level macro for non-macroeconomists???  
 13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale.  I think I've had enough of his novels 
 In all honesty, this book was severely lacking in just about every area. It wasn't horrible. I didn't mind reading it, but there were just so many problems with the story as a whole, so many poorly developed aspects that kept it from being a truly good read. The story was very two-dimensional, lacking development and depth. It was just very superficial.  The characters have very little depth or exploration. The authors give you some basic history, but fail to really explore them. They mention things but then never really tell you about them. An example is Maggie's pregnancy. You know that the antagonist got her pregnant at a young age, and you're told that there was some sort of cover-up to get her out of town so no one would know. But they never give you any details. You have no idea exactly how old she was, and you're not told anything at all about this cover-up. Where did she go? What did she do? How did she handle it all? Why did she make up a husband? It would have been nice to have these details and it would have given another dimension to Maggie's character.  Zack's was in a similar state. You know his FBI step-father was killed by the antagonist but you learn little else, other than that Zack was greatly affected by the slaying. I wanted to know how old Zack was when his mother married his step-father, what their relationship was like, how he dealt with the man's death, etc. Again, knowing all this would have made the character more full-bodied. The authors just failed to give these characters any depth at all.  The romance between them was poorly developed as well. It seemed extremely forced, with very little emotion involved. It was like, hey, let's kiss; hey, let's have sex; hey, I think I might have feelings for you. I wasn't feeling the chemistry between them at all. I had a really hard time believing that these two characters were in love.  There were also some minor areas where issues bothered me. One was that Zack, as an FBI Agent, was allowed to participate in the case at all. He was personally connected (his father being killed by the antagonist 14 years earlier). I had a hard time buying that that would be allowed. Also, Destiny, who had roles in the other books, is done a serious injustice in this book. She's paired off and engaged with hardly a whisper. A little more on that would have been nice.  As for the good points...well, I enjoyed the cameos of Max and Jamie. Fleas the hound dog and Butterbean the goat were great. And the actual plot wasn't too bad. But none of that could overcome the holes in the book. I was rather disappointed overall once I finished.  Rating: 2 / 5 
 This book was absolutely useless.  I used this book in 1999/2000 and found the majority of the information contained in this book to be inaccurate or very outdated.  I encountered numerous situations where services, i.e. trains, buses, hotels and museums had closed down or not existed for up to 10 years in the past!  The 2nd addition did not update any of even the most basic of information.   After countless experiences of "wrong advise/info" I tossed the book.   Please bear in mind that I lived in Mexico for one year and traveled extensively during this time with my Mexican wife. Buy any other book but this one! You have been warned 
 I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time. 
 It is a book about a dog. A cat liked a dog because he doesn't do dog things like bark at night,howl,beg and run away!There is a big suprise!I read some of the book so far and I liked it, so will you 
 As a parent of 3 boys who love Star Wars, we are constantly purchasing books.  We have always purchased them at Borders (or stores of the like).  This was the first time I purchased a book on-line thru Amazon.  Within ONE MONTH the binding came unglued.  This has never occured with any of the other Star Wars books we've purchased.  My boys are very protective of their books and take care of them.  We now have a book with the hard-cover off and I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and due to this do not plan on purchasing online thru Amazon if this is the quality I am to expect in the future 
 Some eroticism, more of a soft-core porn movie but unlike most of those there is the plot.  The problem is perhaps that some of that plot gets lost in the translation, and there is much about Sada that goes unsaid and you are left to guess. The movie wasn't overly graphic in terms of sex, in my opinion, but the non-sexual images and some of the story was quite freakish.  Not worthy of the class people are putting it in on many of their 'most erotic movies' lists...  or maybe it's just not a very good movie. Was looking for an artistic, erotic masterpiece...this was about as erotic as a clockwork orange, but nowhere that good.  Some of the reviews here would have been more helpful--we wish we had read them, but I admit I didn't want to spoil the plot completely.  
 Clipped, petite and looking more like a leather bar Anne Murray, Crow drags out the hits and the `friends' for this all-star live bash. Half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends (All I Wanna Do, Everyday Is a Winding Road, A Change Would Do You Good, Leaving Las Vegas). With only slight variations on these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms) Crow's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum. The rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools (Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Sarah McLachlan, Chrissie Hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. Reduced to the role of supporting guitarist, Crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like Nicks (who unravels admirably on Gold Dust Woman), Hynde and McLachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit (Hynde's If It Makes You Happy)-and-miss (McLachlan's The Difficult Kind) headbutt at Crow's hits. But it isn't until Clapton's suspendered, cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update Cream's White Room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's devastating climax. Fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies, Clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his Paleolithic past  is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic Brontosaurus. It's horrifying to think that this is what Cream would have sounded like if they hadn't broken up. Thank God for egos. It's almost a relief to hear Richards mindlessly croak his way through the old Stones Exile-era toss-off Happy, as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but. Besides, Richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an Egyptian mummy. The wrapper finds the entire gang, from Spanky Nicks to Buckwheat Clapton, joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten  rendition of Dylan's Tombstone Blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one 
 There are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead: 1) The lead (the delectable Ashley Judd) had better show some skin. 2) Thou shalt not be boring.  Twisted utterly fails on both counts.  Basically, Judd is Jessica Shepard, a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers.  She's fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars, because she's self-destructive.  Only Jessica looks fabulous all the time, even when she's been on a bender (which is apparently every night).  How she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic.  Jessica is mentored by John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson).  For a second there I thought Jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self.  I was wrong.  Things take a turn for the strange after Jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered.  And she keeps having these weird blackouts every night.  The victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand.  Poor Jessica is haunted by her parents' murder/suicide and wonders...since her father went on a mass-murdering spree before he killed himself, could she too have the "serial killer gene"?  Jessica is paired with Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), an Italian goomba who is alternately creepy, lecherous, and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie, wants to get into her pants.  Mike follows her around an awful lot...could HE be the killer?  Or maybe it's the ex-boyfriend cop, Jimmy Schmidt (Mark Pellegrino).  Or maybe it's...actually, I figured it out in the first ten minutes.  Being something of a true crime fan, and having read a bit on the subject, this entire premise is absurd. You don't wake up one day and become a serial killer; if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer, it screams DANGER from day one.  Pretty Jessica has none of those problems in her past, except for a vague "suppressed rage" that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face.  Her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship, and neither does the rest of her. Although the script wants us to believe she's a haggard cop, the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end.  Not once, but twice.  And it's not a naked rear end either.  So we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around, yet there are very few bedroom scenes.  We have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings (Who is that lady across the street?  Why does Jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it?).  On one hand, the cops are strictly by the book; they make a big deal out of the fact that Jessica kicks a serial killer in the face.  On the other hand, nobody pulls Jessica off the case when she's a prime suspect, nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around.   Neither sleazy or highbrow, gritty or moralistic, Twisted is so boring, it gets bored with itself 
 Not terrible, but I don't get the hype.  To me, it's just New Wave Disco-and Disco was bad in the 70's.  Finally, what's this doing in a "Power Pop" category?  No freaking way is this remotely Power Pop!  What a disgrace to Power Pop lovers 
 I never made it beyond CD #1 because that was so uninteresting that I wasn't going to subject myself to further rambling.  The "coach" does LOTS of name dropping & just giving examples.  During the whole of CD #1, he gave about 2 mins. of actual work for you to try.  The rest was just listening to him speak about...him.  I would save my money and go to your local voice coach.  I think you will be much better off.  If one is not listed in your phone book, try your local high school music teachers (they give private lessons after school to make extra money).  You can also try a local community college or church music director.  Go for live help, not CD.  Besides, an actual person can help you with specific areas where a CD just keeps repeating itself.  I hope this helped.. 
 i think the newer version "the love affair" with Warren Beatty/Annette Benning better. 
 No Rocky Top?!?  Why bother??  That's like warm beer & cold pizza, close but not quite 
 All I want to know is if the book in questiob is an accurate translation of the Koran (Quran, whatever). There is way too much arguing and posturing in these reviews about the Koran in general and not enough discussion about the individual translation itself 
 I found the book to be a waste of time, energy, ink, and trees. It is nothing more then common sense re-emphasized. It gives a little bit of understanding the basic personality types, but does not give one the ability to "speed read". It basically says stuff like 'if a person is shy and doesnt socialize well, they are an introvert', well duhhh. DO NOT waste your money on piece-o-crap book. It is useless 
 I received the book and CD with hopes to put it to good use for some of my sculpture work. I looked through the book and sent this back without trying the CD because the poses were horrible. The images provide little information that is of any use anatomically or expressively speaking. These poses are so stiff and contrived looking. They are not poses anyone would take in the performance of daily living or activities. Allot of the models are posed so unaturally that they almost look like they are in pain. What kind of results can any artist hope for with such stiff images to reproduce in any fashion? When I pose a nude I consider greatly the position for that particular model. It is no different than selecting the right actor for a part in a play. Some positions are better suited to different individual characters than others. They should be a natural for that part. The positioning of a model should look fluid and natural or should be dynamic in its stress points. Even the poses that are reproducing famous works from the past don't even come close to expressing what the original works have done. The archer pose taken from the great work of the French artist Antoine Bourdelle for example is pathetic. One would gain greater results if they used his sculpture as a reference. At least the concept of harmonious positive and negative spaces and stress , tension, and movement would be better understood. If one is not looking for expression and sensitivity in their work with the human form than maybe this is for them. Maybe they should also consider taking there own video then still capture,of a model on a turntable for reference as I do. It is not that expensive to hire someone for the time that that takes. I hope the originators of this idea considered obtaining the assistance of a qualified professional working in three dimentions for the third edition of virtual pose 
 There's no doubt that I'm a Cohen fan.  I enjoy his poetry and believe his songs are some of the best compositions I've ever heard.  That aside, I'm a little astonished to find out that The Favorite Game has thus far received only glowing reviews on Amazon.    Now don't get me wrong.  I already said I'm a Cohen fan, and not a fair weather one at that.  And I agree whole-heartedly that this book beautifully documents processes of growing up and self-realization - I DEFINITELY recommend this book if you're exploring the tougher times of those processes yourself.  There's also no doubt that his use of metaphor is incredibly brilliant, some of the best I've read out of any writer.  However, I find the writing in a life-transitory novel like this one to be unexpectedly weak.  One of the major transition points in the book is underexplored in a way that I think leaves major holes in the story.  I felt I was at a very critical point in the book when Cohen summed up very major events in a few paragraphs and raced me to the end of the book. Sure, maybe that's how life works ... the traumatic events happen quickly and there's not much to say about them, and you're raced to a conclusion.  Either way, that's not what I want or expect out of an artist who's as brilliant as Leonard Cohen.  I'm no lit major, but when I pick up a book with as much weight as this, and from someone with as much to say as Cohen, I expect to reach the end without the feeling I've been cheated because of a lack of detail.  More importantly, I want to get to the end knowing that in 250 pages I know this  character, really know him, and maybe see myself in him if I'm lucky.  Unfortunately, Cohen just didn't get me there.  Definitely read this book.  But don't read it expecting a Catcher in the Rye or a Bell Jar, because his writing here simply doesn't live up to that. At least not for me. 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 I bought this book because I've read and enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's plays and I knew it was her last work. Frankly, I wish she hadn't written it. Like many other reviewers, I was reminded of books like Hollywood Wives in the first half. Parodies of lifestyles of the super-rich, like most chick lit, have about exhausted themselves. Without more, it's like been there, done that. The second half of the book, if anything, was worse. Either someone else finished it for her, or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters. Since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place, I skimmed the last few chapters. Satire is the dark side of humor. It should be witty and thought-provoking. This book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work 
 Are the other reviewers listening to the same cd I was?  This cd was awful.  There was no definable genre of music, it was just all over the place.  A major disappointment compared to the masterpiece that is the "Provision" cd.  The cd title is right, these are "songs to remember":  they'll be remembered for how bad they were!  Avoid this one at all costs.    
 This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.   Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.  Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses.  People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it.  For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale. 
 If you're a commissioned sales rep calling outbound biz to biz, this book is NOT for you. Nothing new or original here.  I suggest you read books by Art Sobczak, Bly or one of the best books ever written on the subject.  Telesales Tips From The Trenches by Joe Cata 
 Beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop. Although microfiber mops are relatively new, major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs. In order to standout from all the competition, five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops. Google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews. Fortunately the "reviews" were fabricated about a month ago so, hopefully, not too many customers have been deceived. My experience has been that most reviewers give, helpful honest reviews. 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all 
 As a big fan of Ralph, I was looking forward to The End of the Affair.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but this movie is dreadful.  Ralph is a brilliant actor, but not even his flawless acting can't compensate for the nonsensical plot and the horrific casting of Julianne Moore.  What happened to Moore?  It is NOT hard to learn a British accent.  From the sounds of it, Moore didn't even try.  She sounds so American she fails to convince anyone she has an ounce of English in her.  And if that weren't bad enough, the plot is as unconvincing as Moore's accent.  She's an adulteress, but miraculously heals a young boy's facial disfigurement and brings Ralph back from the dead. Even the priest admires her--adultery and all! Her husband does not know the meaning of jealously and lets Ralph live in the house even though he knows of the affair.  Still amidst the unbelievable, the plot is so predicatable.  She coughs a few times here and there.  So we know (before anyone in the movie figures it out) that she's dying.  We also know why she "ends" the affair long before its "revealed" to Ralph. And by the way, what was with all the nudity?  Totally unnecessary and vulgar 
 I think there is some high quality writing on this disc and I find 3-4 of the songs to be quite listenable. However, that's the highest compliment I can muster. With the exception of "Now Comes The Night," only b/c I burned it onto a compilation, I haven't listened to this cd since the month it came out. I wasn't looking for a Justin Timberlake-esque album when I picked this up. I just don't dig whatever direction Rob wanted to go in with his solo material. I find the stylistic inconsistency as a hinderance to the album rather than a selling point for his diversity. Next effort please 
 this book led me down the road of jesus' death and i thought it could have done a better job. it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring 
 The aim of the book is to teach readers about contracts and how to write good ones. The main points are summarized at the start of the book in a series of six guidelines (as described in the review above):  - Separate queries from commands  - Separate basic queries from derived queries  - Write a postcondition for each derived query that specifies what result can be returned  - Write a postcondition for each command that specifies the value of every basic query  - Decide on a suitable precondition for every query and command  - Write invariants to define unchanging properties of objects   This part is well written and provides good advice for people new to writing contracts. The presentation is however very academic with examples based on stacks and dictionaries.  The authors then try to present more realistic examples. Unfortunately that's where they fail badly.   The first example shows how to use contracts to write an observer pattern. The only thing that the authors show is that you can write a contract that makes sure that the observers are properly added to the list of observers. Since most modern languages implement the observer pattern in the language itself (via events), this is a contract that no-one needs to write. The problem that usually happens in real programming is that the events are wired up too early or too late. Contracts provide little help for this. The authors should have chosen an example that better demonstrates the power of contracts.  The second example is an over-extended explanation about how you can write code so that you never call a method when its precondition is false. The explanation is convoluted and offers no real insight into programming by contracts.  The final chapter discusses applying contracts to languages that do not support them natively (basically all languages other than Eiffel). I had high hopes for this chapter. Unfortunately, the authors recommend using a pre-processor (e.g., iContracts) or only implementing preconditions with assertions. Most programmers with a little experience will already be using assertions and will not learn much from the chapter.  The book is a compilation of various papers that the authors published in conferences (mainly TOOLS). The problem is that the material is suited to a 20 page paper not a 200+ page book. Even with repetitions and ample space the lack of useful information is apparent. The second half of the book is a waste of paper.   Contracts are a very useful tool when properly applied. The guidelines presented at the start of the book are very good. Unfortunately the book is marred by a lack of real world examples 
 I really liked the first one of these and got excited about the second, but its just lame. the characters don't even look the same ( or have the same voices ) and its just horrible. Looks like some crappy tv show or something bad dunno. not worth more then 3 dollars. lo 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 I was looking for a book to guide me in postponing or avoiding hip replacement surgery.  The title "The Active Person's Guide to Taking Charge"  prompted me to buy this book, but I was disappointed in the book because so little of it was devoted to really taking charge of your physical situation so that you can strengthen your hip and achieve its maximum flexability.  A better choice for those wishing to do everything in their power to avoid or postone surgery would be Dr. Klapper's book, "Heal Your Hips", which is also available from Amazon.co 
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 There are parts of this book which are utterly engrossing.  Rosemont constructs a fine narrative of events.  Perhaps I should say "events", as it is at times researched like a eighth-grade paper.  Lots of conjecture, unsupported speculation, hearsay and other aspects of irresponsible scholarship.  Mr. Rosemont freely admits that there is frustratingly little concrete evidence about much of Hill's life, but he chooses to try and flesh out a lengthy book anyways.  This is exasperating at times as when one is forced to try and endure each and every tedious mentioning of the drawn or painted art of Joe Hill, despite the lack of much actual material (surviving anyways).  However, by doing this he touches on many peripheral aspects of Hill's life that have gone by and large unnoticed till now, but which are much easier to verify than the sketchy details about Hill himself.  Several mentions of correspondence, lives affected by Hill, and reactions to Hill's art, and many others tidbits of information are thrown out for more or less the first time in cohesive form.  Less cohesive, and downright teasing at times, are many starts and stops of several ideas that would be very interesting on their own.  The Wobbly influence on the beat poets, the slighting of the IWW by other revolutionary and pseudorevolutionary groups (rarely written about from a fellow worker's perspective), and others seem like promising beginnings for reading but then are waded into only ankle-deep.  At one point when abandoning a topic Mr. Rosemont even suggests that it would be a good idea for further research, by someone else.  All in all a fairly decent read but could have used prodigious editing and some fact-checking with standards higher than those of the NY Times 
 This was like reading a year's worth of newspapers at once.  There is absolutely nothing worthwhile that even the most casual Yankee fan doesn't know.  (Jeter and A-Rod don't get along?  you're kidding!)  This was clearly slapped together and put out to coincide with the start of the baseball season.  I read a lot of baseball books and this is waaaayyyyy at the bottom.  
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 While most reviews of this book are fairly glowing I must really disagree. There are two very serious flaws to this book and CD.   One is that the book requires you to learn a difficult and non-intuitive phonic alphabet system to approximate the sounds of the Khmer language. In the vast majority of the cases the tortured phonics made up by the authors could have been very closely approximated by already known and intuitive english letter/phonic cominations that every english speaker already knows. In other words the authors have made up symbols and then give you english word equivalents that approximate the Khmer sound. Then it is these symbols that are used throughout the text to "learn" the Khmer sounds. In reality most guidebooks do a much better job by using combinations of letters that we all know the sounds of to approximate the Khmer. It is needlessly complex.  The second fatal flaw is the CD set. Throughout the CD the Khmer speaker only says the word or phrase ONCE, never repeating. For any language this is just not adequate but for a language that is as difficult as Khmer is to western ears this is a serious shortcoming. You really need to hear these words more than once, then repeated in a sentence, in context, then repeated in the english translation.  Some areas of the book are better as are the lettering practice sections. However they too are hobbled by the really unworkable phonetic symbols used throughout.  Give this set a pass. If I could get my money back I would. Alan Perry Seattle W 
 There is no excuse for Norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as ZoneAlarm before installing the software, especially since previous versions have been compatible.  Once opened, returning the product can be a problem, perhaps that it what Norton is counting on 
 The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. This is a magazine lifestyle. You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table. 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 If you are looking for play food that is like little tikes or fisher price, this is not it!! There is a reason you get 101 pieces for 19.99!!  These pieces are much smaller and made from a thinner cheaper plastic.  Not at all what i expected from a quality company like step 2. To top it off, this set does NOT come in a retail box but is cheaply packaged in plastic bags.  I am sure my daughter doesn't mind these are cheaply made or small but i sure as heck do.  I could have bought a Kidconnection set from walmart for less money and maybe even of better quality 
 I suppose some people think that one can write anything in a book and call it "history."  But I think Smith's portrayal of the conflict is just too misleading to be called history.  Real people in real life do real things for real reasons.  But after reading this book, I had an image of wicked unarmed Zionists maliciously stealing land from hapless heavily armed Arabs.  It wasn't exactly what Smith had said.  But it was close enough to make me realize what was wrong with the book.  The constant whitewashing of Arab misdeeds and criticism of reasonable Jewish behavior had simply erased the motivations for the two sides in the conflict.  Are there books that do a better job?  Oh yes.  I'll give you ten examples of books that are far better, and there are many, many more:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict (Bard, 2003) A History of Israel (Sachar, 1996) The Siege (O'Brien, 1986) A Young Person's History of Israel (Bamberger, 1985) The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem (Casper, 2003) Atlas of the Middle East Conflict (Gilbert, 2002) Islam and Dhimmitude (Ye'or, 2002) Right to Exist (Lozowick, 2003) A Place Among Nations (Netanyahu, 1993) From Time Immemorial (Peters, 1984)  Try one of them. 
 There is essentially no sound amplification.  The sound levels are barely different with the thing on as opposed to having it off.  Sort of a "what were they thinking" product 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 After he set out the initial scene and made narrative inroads, the author proceeded to regale us with his views on time and why they're important.  These pseudo-science views could have all made a great short story but had no place interspersing with an actual narrative.  It really screamed for a good editor to sit the poor man down and say "No. 
 This card died on me after about a year of use. My laptop will detect the card, but it won't power up. My reaction? Good Riddance! I now have an excuse to get a different card.   As others have stated, this card uses its own drivers, and they don't work well. Everytime I woke my laptop from suspend mode, the card would fail to reconnect to the network, forcing me to remove and reinsert the card, then do a 'repair' of my connection. Huge hassle.   It looks like you get what you pay for with these cards, so stay away from the cheap ones! 
 This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing 
 I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say "Norman Bates," people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.   The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*  Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS. 
 I was disappointed in this book because it atttibutes all evil to the Nazi branch of the Illuminati without any reference to the Zionist Communist branch. The tips offs are 1) He defends an acknowledged Communist spy Harry Dexter White as a true patriot.  He retails the lie that James Forrestal committed suicide. Don't waste your money on this book. 
 We purchased this toy after my daughter enjoyed playing with this at my sister's house. In spite of reading the reviews stating this toy didn't always work, we purchased it...and, of course, it didn't work properly.  Only one side was blowing bubbles and they were very, very weak.  I spoke with my sister and she admitted that her bubble machine has good days and bad days.  Needless to say, we returned it 
 The book starts by bringing you straight into the feeling of despair and alienation Elaine and her husband Paul are experiencing in their suburban life. You feel a vague sympathy for them and wonder, "what must be going on in their lives to make them feel so trapped?"  This question is never really answered. The book spends time expressing this depressing state of being in various satirical situations, but never gets beyond the expression of that feeling, which we get from the first page of the book. She offers no insight on why the characters came to feel the way they do, or what they can do to get out of it. As a character portrait all that is fashioned for the protagonist Elaine is the feeling of helplessness; no other aspects of her psyche or personality are defined. We learn nothing about her thoughts, views on the world, personality, or patterns of thinking that may give us a hint as to why she got that way. The same can be said for Paul.   Their environment gives us few clues as well. They live the typical life of a suburban family. They have good kids, good money, and good friends. Since we have seen this story portrayed in many better books and movies before, we can guess what the problems of their environment are. They feel they have to put up a front of stability and happiness for the people they are around, even their closest friends and family. They feel they are only going through the motions of daily life, and following a set of societal rules.   But, the thing is, their lives aren't any worse than anyone else's; in fact, they live pretty good lives. Anyone in any situation anywhere on the planet could be feeling what the characters are. One gets the sense that the author feels this is the general human condition. What this means for us as a race of people is never explored; instead it's dealt with in sloppy, broad strokes, with an ending too dramatic and serious for the scope of the novel. The aspects of the novel that are meant to be ironic and funny are not creative enough to even be clever. Nor are the things that are meant to be shocking at all original enough to have us surprised. Skip this novel and rent American Beauty. 
 That looks nothing like a church.  That looks like a 1950s Russian gymnasium with a novelty gambling table in the middle of it.  The aesthetics of this book are terribly dated.  They are the religious equivalent of the 'brave new vision' of all those architects who spent their careers polluting the world with multi-storey car-parks and neo-brutalist power plants.  May this madness end, and soon 
 And what are those words?   Why, simply put they are:  "DENZEL WASHINGTON IS NO FRANK SINATRA"   Any questions?  No, I didn't think s 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I did not like this book at all. I speak clearly but I want to be more articulate and hold my "audiences" attention.    The breathing exercises and banging out the ZZZZs and EE-I-EE-I-OOs did not help me.  Maybe I just don't understand what the author is trying to get across so it could actually be good information.  I also agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this author seems to just drop a lot of names.  It got a little old after a while 
 only in very small letters, INSIDE  the book, they say it is "THE ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE 2". Since I allready had that book, now i have two copies of the same book. VERY BAD PRACTICE OF THE PUBLISHERS. DONT BUY IT IF YOU ALLREADY HAVE THE ACD2 
 Reading this book was a total waste of time. I met the author recently. She asked if we thought any of the book was irrelevant...personally I thought the whole book was irrelevant 
 I was disappointed with the book. It was not as helpful for the small, individual investor as I wanted it to be. $10,000 spread over 50 stocks means investing $200 per stock without even talking about any fees for buying and selling 50 different stocks. So from this book I can narrow down my indivual selection of stocks to 25 or 50, but if I only want to purchase 3-5 stocks how do I decide which 3-5 of the 50 to buy?   The book did give me a broader understanding of the different strategies used behind mutual funds. When I review a mutual fund's strategy, now I know the lingo and what the fund manager is looking for in a stock and how that strategy compares to other strategies. So I think the book has made me a better mutual fund shopper, but has not helped me as much in purchasing individual stocks 
 I've had this book through 4 cats and kittens, and if you have a really healthy cat who never develops any illnesses, it's great. I find myself using the Cornell Feline Health Center online for my cats.   The diagnostic tree is just too vague, the descriptions of diseases are also too vague and there's just not enough information. Using a vet's resource center with a dictionary handy does you--and your cat--more good, especially if your cat has something really serious.   
 I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover.  The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her. 
 This album is like a double edge sword. You really can't take anything lil john does serious. This album is just meant for one dimesional people who's life is to party. The beats is what makes people cop it. So if your lookin at it from that point of view, then this a great album. But if your like me and your lookin for true mc's who can actually spit bars then you gon' hate everything this guy puts out. I gotta give props to the south cause they know how to party, but the south is the reason why people who don't listen to hip hop say it's stupid and sounds the same. The mainstream stained hip hop's reputation forever 
 Outdated and poorly written, I found this book to be a big disappointment. Many topics relating to the professional esthetician were not thoroughly covered or were not covered at all. In many instances, the author was incorrect in the scientific aspects of the book. Many things were not fully explained. It seemed as if the author wrote the bare minimum in order to complete a book. The only skin care discussed was a facial. This is a basic skill taught in cosmetology school. Check out Milady's Standard Textbook for Professional Estheticians instead. I found it to be a much better text 
 I had a good laugh when reading your reviews of a Cliffs Notes.  I mean....oh, man....*laughs*.  The book is great and I can't believe you even bothered to pick up an abreviated version.  It might be several  hundred pages, but it's a page turner.  So, expand your mind 
 I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists. The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color. The storyline, however, is amateurish. Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of "suspension of disbelief", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable. Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan? And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother? DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician? The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics. The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive. Were his parents abusive? Why the displaced agression towards Bruce? The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama. I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there. I wished the writing lived up to the art work 
 I had not read this author and was so disappointed in this book I have returned it to Amazon, even though I will be out the shipping costs!  It is written as though talking to and written by a 6 year old.  I am insulted that she would even think an adult would read this book.  I recommend you do not waste your money. If you can't make an art journal, visit the many wonderful on-line websites that will teach you how for free, and offer guidance by other on-line journalers and artists. This book is a total waste of money 
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 God, i tried 4 times to get into this series and just could'nt. I love the authors other works.. but this one was too "much" for me and i just could'nt get it. I will come back to it in 6 months and see if i can read and finish it. 
 Thau over complicates her points.  The book is too difficult to understand.  I am an attorney who has been investing in stocks and bonds for over 10 years.  This book is not appropriate for any level investor 
 This book might -- MIGHT -- be of use to the beginner or the casual practitioner, but anyone who has been involved in paganism or wicca for any length of time will not find much here that hasn't been covered elsewhere.   And, I am sorry to say, covered in more depth. The illustrations are nice,  though, and for someone who is not very familiar with wicca or paganism  this might be helpful, but ONLY as a start down the path.  If you're  further on down the Way, there's not much of any interest here, sad to say.   And what is it with Llewellyn and spelling errors?  This book is loaded  down with them.  People, Microsoft Word includes a spellcheck function -  USE IT 
 The premise of the book -- scientists trying to contact the near past in order to divert environmental disaster -- is interesting.  The premise and the alternate version of the present might have even been fascinating except that the ideas are overwhelmed by much too much text, unnecessary plot developments, incredibly boring detail, and characters you don't much care about.  Of all the many, many books I've read in my life, I have purposely not finished only a very few -- but this was one of them.  I was just too disinterested to continue reading 
 As someone who was bullied growing up and who now has children in school, I was eager to read this book. But I was disappointed and in some ways disgusted. Perhaps part of that is my own fault -- my expectations held all the way to the end that I would get some insight, just some little peak into why bullying happens, whether it can be stopped, what adults can do to stop it or negate its effects. Anything useful. I also grew up with the attitude that kids (and adults) shouldn't be bullying each other, period. They shouldn't be obsessed with popularity, wealth, beauty, social climbing. Just let me be me and stop laughing at me, and I'll let you be you and treat you with equal respect. Well, Jodee isn't coming from that perspective. Her entire book is a rant based on the assumption that she should have been popular among her peers and that cruel kids and cruel fate robbed her of this right -- the right to be one of the other bullies! And how does she deal with it? By becoming a narcissist for life and writing a book bragging about how she now hobnobs with celebrities -- while taking her jabs at her peers who didn't give her the status she felt she deserved. I'm sorry, but I cannot relate to that at all. It is disgusting and pathetic, and an injustice to see this recommended by so many people. How does this help kids? It tells them that they can be popular too if they fight, scratch, complain their way to the "top" of something, and write a book to say "see, I told you I should have been popular! Nyah!" If I could give this book a zero or negative stars, I would have 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
  This movie is the BIG LIE logic attempting to prove itself again.  Most despotic criminals use a BIG LIE concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which Stan "Tookie" Williams is cut.  This DVD is nothing more than a BIG LIE! that ranks right up there with NAZI BIG LIE era Triumph Of The Will.  Like any monster Tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart.  This DVD should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how BIG LIES told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls.  Even if Stan Tookie" Williams is just responsible for "Helping Create" the Crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book.  That he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 Minutes, "convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is, redeemed" is of no consequence whatsoever.  Tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods.  Tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings.  Tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had.  Tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order.  Tookie Williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer's reality.  In the end Tookie Williams got what he deserved a needle ride to Hell's Gate if there is any enternal justice.  Buy this Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story DVD if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work.  I look at Stan Tookie William's and all I see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his "caged creep conversion" but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way.  When I saw this DVD on Stan "Tookie" Williams he reminded me of Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit.)  This is a good DVD because Jamie Foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic, self absorbed social parasite in Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story.  If Tookie gets a Nobel Prize I think he should be forced to share it with Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction, child killing, weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit 
 may god have mercy upon this poor excuse for a mans sou 
 This book is all fluff and very little real information.  The language is cloying and takes away from any recipe that I would consider making.  Rachel shoud stick to TV where it's fun to watch her, and forget books unless she's writing kiddie books.  I am an accomplished cook and was hoping to find some easy, quick recipes.  Instead, I was annoyed by all the Cute Stuff 
 being into metal for many,many years i had decided to give this release a try,as many other fans of this genre had purchased Man o war albums and counted themselves as fans. now,before i continue,i must stress that i have a high tolerance for CHEESE(as any metal fan must possess past the age of 17)but this band pushes those boundaries to the breaking point. i was quite willing to overlook the Kiss-meets-the Village-People-on Steroids album cover,but again the CHEESE quotient was just too much. bottom line,the music is pretty weak - whether you prefer thrash,death,power,progressive,classic,whatever-else metal its the same verdict - i simply dont see what others are getting out of this....one of lifes mysteries i suppos 
 The release of every Madonna album, especially every album in the past five years or so, is a tremendous event. There's no denying that the once "material girl" has become the single most important female entertainer of any generation. And with each release, her worldwide audience is reminded once again of this uber-status. Yes, this single is extremely beautiful and has a beat that stays tuned in my head all day, but the remixes are totally a waste. I MEAN, WAKE UP! There are 6 tracks out of 8 that sound exactly the same... It's impossibly lame. Yes, the Big room rock mix stands up a little more than the others, but... There is no album version on this waste! Save your money, it's not worth 
 I can't stand these workbooks; answering any of the questions requires lengthy copying of passages from the textbook itself. If it's not required for a class, I wouldn't bother, as this is not a "study guide" but simply a workbook 
 Certainly Robert P. Hanssen was a difficult man to understand but the main problem that I have with this book it is impossible to determine whether you are reading real facts or fiction.   After reading the book, I am not sure whether it was the excitement or the money that was the major cause.  Anyway I was hoping for a study of what Robert P. Hanssen gave away. The effect on security etc. There is little of this 
 Chang has written a lot of books on various subjects.  I don't know how they sell, but the two that I have read, this one and Continuous Process Improvement Tools ('93) are just too basic for effective use.  A beginner book, no more.  At the end of each chapter, the author includes a page or two of checklists and questions, which, combined with the generous use of whitespace, take the place of more substantive content, which could have been included.  But then many of the people reading this for introduction to CPI would probably have put it down.  A much better book on the subject is Principles of Total Quality, by Omachonu & Ross.  It is a near-textbook quality treatment of TQM which is readable by the novice as well as more expert individuals 
 This is sabotage rather than a tribute to Tupac.  This doesn't do him justice.  Listening to this CD, I thought of "This is Spinal Tap" - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge, and everyone is looking around thinking "what the hell is going on?"  That must have been how Tupac felt at this show.  The part of the CD where you can actually hear someone flipping through "all eyez on me" trying to find the right song...that was when I knew this CD was crap.  Tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work.  This is an abomination.  Well, what more can you say?  Death Row needed a little extra holiday bling, I guess.... My recommendation - don't buy it.  You might as well just listen to All Eyez on Me and sing along.  
 While there were some interesting quotes, this book will leave most fans feeling somehow cheated since the entire book could be read by any child or adult in one sitting.  It's definitely not so much a book that was researched and then written as it is a book composed of a bunch of quotes all randomly thrown together.  There are much better books out there on racing so save your money and buy one of them 
 After all the reviews I read, this has to be one of THE 'disappointing' albums I have picked up in the recent past. The music is dated, the lyrics are poor and the overall direction seems pointless. Where is Eric taking  his music? I have no idea. Drop it. There's tons of better talent out  there 
 I mistakenly read Falling Liberty before any of the other Ana Pigeon series. This one is poor example of Barr's skill and story telling finesse. She tosses out several over-ripe cliches that made me cringe in agony. Luckily, my wife persisted I read Track of the Cat and now I'm almost through the series.  This one is regrettable 
 Most of the book is simply a short summary of news events of the past few years, with a few 'shock and awe' highly unlikely events thrown in to amaze the reader. Rees argues that humanities days are numbered, but a good third of the book is dedicated to discussions of alien life, mankind's travel to the stars, and the future of science - all these activities with time spans much greater than the next 50-100 years that he predicts our 50% probability lies. Save your money- and simply listen to the news 
 Sheena wasn't made to win any Academy awards. Nevertheless, for a "B" film the photography is actually quite good. Granted, Tanya's acting ability at this time in her life needed a lot of work. I'm sure the producers were aware of this going in and didn't care. They knew the attraction would be to watch Sheena doing her thing in her jungle outfit. Tanya was the perfect choice considering the reason for the film. Sheena was made to showcase Tanya Roberts stunning physical attributes and was successful in this regard. She is the reason the movie is still moderately popular after 20 years. So if you like this type of eye-candy film, enjoy! It wasn't meant to be anything else 
 I had been a Smashing Pumpkins fan for 10 years. I formerlly collected every CD that ever existed. I've met James Iha, Jimmy Chamberlain, and even Billy Corgan. I want to tell you the truth. This is the worst album that ever existed. The OLD Billy Corgan is NO MORE. The OLD James Iha is NO MORE. Every member of the Smashing Pumpkins has found their happiness elsewhere. D'arcy Wretzky is riding horses at a ranch in Michigan. True happiness in retirement. Jimmy is married and has a child. James Iha has friends with young admirers and enjoys DJing over music. Billy Corgan found God and made TheFutureEmbrace and will revive The Smashing Pumpkins in it's truest form -- Happinness leads to God leads to Fulfillment. Think wisely before investing in this CD for your extrovertive and creative Teenager. Give him or her a positive outlet. Look to Jimmy Hendrix, The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Beatles, David Bowie, Culture Club (pre-1985) and maybe even Sheryl Crow. Wait until the NEW Smashing Pumpkins arrives. Then you'll see the magic that awaits with the Pumpkin revival 
 I previously wrote a pretty harsh review of this book after purchasing it last year. In recent times my opinion of it has changed. The book captures TONS of good thoughts , and has excellent still photos. Its very useful, once you get past the fact that there are no video samples included with the book. I would dare to say that if it were to include such video clips on DVD or multimedia CD, it would become an EXCELLENT learning/reference tool for young directors (etc) searching to master their artform.   If only i could edit this review to say 4 1/2 stars!  < please see my old review below>  'Coffee Table Book - More form than function'  Maybe i am being harsh, but the book seems like an 'artbook' with no tangible vision of how its REALLY supposed to bring knowledge to its readers. Its the prettiest book in the box of ten that i bought last week on Amazon, but its content is suited either for the person with just a passing interest in music videos (like a sunday afternoon coffee guest - "Will she glance at the cosmopolitan or read the Music Video book?" or someone else who has lots time and no specific interest in music videos).   I hardly feel like i am IN the 'minds' of these directors, truly learning from the way they THINK, or other aspects of thier creative story. The book is more like a compilation of 'behind the scenes' glances on 'E' or VH1.   Perhaps including a CD inside the book, with medium resolution copies of all the videos would help a bit. The visual reference would turn each conversation with the directors into a tangible learning experience that anyone with a PC could relate to.   The worst part for me is that most of these videos are of a genre that i dont listen to. I am primarily R&B, Hip-hop, Reggae (Dancehall) by blood and by love. The only people in this book who i listen to are Lauryn Hill and Seal.  I am really disappointed by this book.   Like i said, the book seems like an 'artbook' with no tangible vision of how its REALLY supposed to bring knowledge to its Audience. I am left to wonder who was the target audience?  <old review ends here> 
 I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said "If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"  
 ...mayhap I have picked the wrong Coulter novel with which to begin. Even still, I cannot say it has been totally without mirth. I have found some of the dialogue laugh-out-loud funny (audio book version.) Talking back in response to the ludicrous dialogue affords some diversion, though mayhap most for drivers around me.  Must everything be redder than red, blacker than black, whiter than white, higher than high, etc? Did I really hear that the earth moved during a vigorous amatory adventure? In subject matter, this dialogue is clearly intended for adult audiences. In construction, it rivals "See Spot run". By all the saints' pimply noses, mayhap the most fun is to be derived from the creative and deliberately non-repetitive invocations of said saints. I could wish though that someone close to the author would favor us by building an auto-correct into her word processor to over-ride "mayhap" and "hard".  Oh, aye, I'll finish it (it really is a long, boring drive home and it is futile to wish the time back) but I'm glad this was a library freebie. By all the saints' split ends, I'd have been madder than mad had I purchased it 
 Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it. I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better.  DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic. Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better 
 I read both this novel and The Truth Machine because a friend highly recommended them.  What a bore...First of all, I give this two stars instead of one star because, at least apparently, it is accurate from a scientific and factual perspective.  Truth be told, Halperin is not a novelist. He is an extremely accomplished amateur futurist.  This novel, like The Truth Machine, has very interesting concepts. Concepts that could have been explained in a very compelling 150-page novel.  Instead Halperin takes us on a journey of self indulgent "gee, this is how smart I am", which would be ok if he could write without using endless clichés, unbelievably shallow characters and excruciatingly boring story lines.  What's so frustrating is that now and again he just about "get's it" and then returns to lecturing the reader.  To top it off he has an incredibly naive and sophomoric understanding of religions, especially Christianity and postmodern philosophy.  I wish I had known I could download the text for free from his website instead of forking over the $7.99 for the book. 
 I bought this book after reading the wonderful reviews by some excellent reviewers and felt sure that this book would enlighten me as to the mystery of death.  Forgive me, P. Atwater, but I found the beginning of the book so hard to believe, that I couldn't take the rest seriously enough.  Perhaps the book 'After Death Then What'  - also recommended by a highly respected reviewer would have been a better place for me to start.  For instance,  when Atwater explains the circumstances of her three deaths, she relates how she miscarried and severely hemorrhaged in the bathroom, which precipitated her first death upon the bathroom floor. She then comes back to life, struggles five blocks to the doctor's office where she collapses in his office.  The doctor apparently doesn't even look at her chart and, while laughing uproariously at the fact that she'd been taken advantage of and raped, injects her in the right thigh with an unknown drug to stop the bleeding and sends her home.  Now, I have very little faith in doctors and constantly question their conclusions, but never have I heard of a doctor who would laugh in the face of a collapsed hemorrhaging woman and then just send her back out to her car to drive home alone.  And if this did happen, why did Atwater not haul him over the coals for malpractice?  The second death occurs as a result of a blood clot forming in her right thigh, causing the 'worst case of phlebitis (the doctor) had ever heard of, let alone seen.  He kept saying "There's no way you can be alive" ".  However, he, too, just sends her home with a prescription of 'dangerous drugs'.  Thus follows a second death from a burst blood clot which Atwater manages to return from unaided.  The third death is the result of the rejection of the man who had raped her coming back to ask her forgiveness (which Atwater gives), and then refusing to listen to her relate the experiences of her previous two deaths.   Apparently, the "emotional blow of being refused was at the core of death number three" She is brought back to life by her son, who sits opposite her and 'talks' her back to life.  No physical intervention such as mouth to mouth resuscitation etc. - just talks.  Later, 'several physicians' verify that if her son had called for medics, Atwater would have gone too far to be resuscitated.    There appears to have been no medical verification at any time that any of these deaths actually occurred.  I'm not suggesting that Atwater is making things up, just that perhaps she may have left her body and had an astral experience that may or may not have been actual death.  Three times returning from 'death' with no help is quite extraordinary, as most medical people will verify after working hard to bring someone back who has 'died' on the operating table.  At this point, I put the book down and forced myself to read the rest later.  Yes, there are some very good points raised, but I'm afraid that I wasn't convinced - much as I would like to be.    
 This film is one of superior production design and cinematography!  (Emmanuel Lubezski is a modern master!)  Unfortunately, "Solo Con Tu Pareja" is an exceedingly farfetched, dumbfoundingly unfunny, and overall haphazard mish-mash of a film.  I could barely crack a smile (nor could my viewing companions) as this disappointingly overrated, spastic piece of fourth-rate Almodovar-like inspiration veered from overwrought scenario contrivances to downright despicable characters.  The inclusion of "ribald slapstick" didn't make matters much better.  There would be no way that I would've guessed -- if I had not known -- that this film was made by the same director of the magnificently evocative, insouciant and melancholy "Y Tu Mama Tambien."  I did not care one iota for any of the characters in "Solo Con Tu Pareja" -- and the one character that I did ("Clarissa"), turned from mysterious to virago before story's end.  (In comparison, this film's womanizing "Tomas" is a far cruder and gaspingly unfunny version of Daniel Day-Lewis' superior "Tomas" in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" -- a far and away superior Criterion title!)  In short, this film was not "entertaining," and I couldn't help but feel that in Almodovar's hands this storyline could've been pulled off.  Nonetheless, as a "first film" for director Cuaron, I will say that he does, indeed -- along with his production designer and cinematographer -- have a great eye for balance and aesthetics.  The writer, however, should be shot....  Of course, this is simply one man's opinion that means absolutely nothing to Cuaron's directorial talents 
 Part of what makes Tori Amos so amazing is her obscure lyrics.  If you can't handle that, then you should LOVE Charlotte Martin.  Charlotte Martin seems more easily marketable.  Good for her, but Tori sells millions without seeming all that marketable.  Comparisons to Tori will probably kill Charlotte 
 I was excited to read this book, and then  I read the first paragraph. This book is a horrible bore. But I have been forced to read it for summer reading. If your not required to read this book, Don't. 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 Won't the Seventies ever come to an end? Haven't women broke the glass ceiling already? The so-called engendering of modernity is an entrapped woman that can't authorize her reality blaming women that have authorized theirs. Move on already... 
 I just didn't enjoy this book. I don't mind so much that a book isn't plot driven if the language is beautiful and the ideas stimulating. With this book, however, I didn't even find the language poetic or evocative. And the ideas were so repetitive and expressed so turgidly that I stopped reading half-way through. I really thought this book could do with a whole lot of editing. It was unsubtle, self-indulgent and dull. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? So disappointed. I had been eager to read this book for ages and when it was finally available at the library I was very excited. Oh well 
 I've recently discovered Krentz at a local library. I've read most of her works by now, and her formula is a little worn from being used so often. I keep reading her mostly because there are flashes of brilliance in her  works that promise to be something more, but all of them then get lost.  Grand Passion is the worst of the lot -- I figured out the mystery of the  paintings by the second or third chapter, and the suspense and romance was  so unrealistic I was skimming every other sentence just to have the relief  of getting to the end 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 The message meant more to me than to my young children.  They didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box.  They think playing in cardboard boxes is fun, not a punishment for exercising too much freedom.  I could see using the book as a basis for discussion, but I think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 Here we see how many ways a naked man can cover his crotch (3, if holding a football-4).  And we see them over and over and over again. I assume the whole series sucks - I've fast-forwarded through two and that's plenty. I'd rather watch the guys play rugby 
 I thought that The Corn Grows Ripe was a boring book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants to read a good book.  The reason I wouldn't recommend it is because it didn't have any exciting events and you never really got to know what a characters personality.  Throughout the book you never get to know anything about the main character Tigre.  In the book you keep reading and waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing ever does.  Also the plot of this book was about a kid planting corn because his father couldn't because he broke his leg and that is possibly the most boring plot ever.  It was set in a small village in the classic Mayan period.  I don't think you should read this book but if you need to I think you should be under the age of 9, because it is simple, has pictures, and it has huge font.  I don't think a boy would like it because it doesn't have any action it is basically reading about a normal life, and I think that, that's also why girls wouldn't like it.  I think the only type of reader that would like this book is a reader who likes reading books with nothing interesting or if they like books about the Maya 
 Don't be scammed. Do yourself a favor and do a search of the web using "quackery" and  "Jordan Rubin". Read about the fake degrees, bogus organizations, and other surreptitious means used by these modern day flim flam artists to line their pockets. If afterward, you are not convinced that you are being scammed by these cons, then you have either not read enough or you are not being honest with yourself.  
 I was very disappointed. The acting by the principles was fine, but I think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by Bob Fosse. I think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs. The following tunes from the original show were left out - Near To You, We've Got To Think About the Game, A Man Doesn't Know. And Applegate's tune, The Good Old Days, was abridged. A new tune, There's Something About an Empty Chair, was added to replace Near To You, but it was very weak. I wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they've done recently with Music Man and Bye Bye Birdie 
 From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...dull pop fluff from Elton and beyond his songs it's karaoke sing-a-long. Skip this and find the Elton songs on a greatest hits package unless you have kids who love karaoke and the movie 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 Obscurity is easy; artistic clarity requires discipline.  Occasionally interesting but for the most part boring in its effort to be different - like every freshman poet.  Shrill delivery.    I really wanted to like this band.  Christian background with high aesthetic standards - sounds like fodder for great discussion.  Instead, it comes off like one of those community college poetry-writing contests.  Obviously the guy is a skilled arranger but there's so much effort thrust into the listener's face: Look how hard I tried to change it up for you!  The music doesn't support the lyrics and the lyrics don't mean much of anything except possibly to the writer and one wonders if this isn't a Robert Browning situation:  "[When I wrote these words only God and Daniel Smith knew what they meant; now, only God knows.]"  What's left?  Shrill musical non sequiturs and burdensome lyrical content.  Be literary, be mysterious, but don't fall into the trap of the undereducated blowhard creating his own "mythology" because real reading, research and synthesis was too hard.  Mr. Smith has a following and a gift for arrangement - but he's short-changing his listeners and limiting his potential impact by messing about with second-rate material.  
 A real eye-opener: with all sincerity, I cannot believe Simon and Schuster has published this under the aegis of "Simon and Schuster Children Publishing." The language is execrable, the text jammed with f--- and sh-- and d---. In the early pages the seventeen-year-old protagonist walks in on her boyfriend's amorous dealings with the girl's own mother. And after she hooks up with street youth we are treated to a thorough detailing of  the materials and the methods of intravenous drug use (only this girl isn't really sure exactly what she's cheerily pumping into her veins), dumpster diving, vandalism, breaking and entering, theft, the tale of a man trying to blind a boy by crushing his eyeball with his thumb, scavenging leftovers from deserted restaurant tables and other like diversions. According to the publisher's website, Ms. Black is a favorite among kids. What I hate most is that these demeaning elements in the story are gratuitous: without them, the book might just be a worthwhile read because of its ingenious world of trolls, tree women, and "faeries." I can see how teenagers would agree that the "world would be cooler with something so unreal in it." As it is, I cannot imagine recommending it to a teen--or anyone else-- to read 
 I only use this crockpot for soups, temp is way too hot for other dishes. I have one with a divided crock which is a great idea for buffets...chili on one side, bean soup on the other. But you have to remember it has no low or warm, just HIGH, so you need to turn it on and off occasionally.  I use the smaller crockpot I bought in 1979 to cook things that need more finesse. If there really were a high, low, and warm on this cooker as the company states, it would be a wonderful product. Unfortunately, the company claims are not truthful 
 This is the worst wrestling bio book ever and for one very good reason: there is no wrestling in it! Oh yes, sorry, about 50 pages out of 300 are about wrestling... The rest of the book is meaningless... I am sorry I ever bought it.. 
 Tao Teh Ching is a monumental work.  Unlike other religious texts, the Tao Teh Ching is barely 5000 letters spread over 81 single-page poetic passages.  You can probably read thru it in a couple hours or less.  But for the serious reader, it can take a lifetime of study and contemplation.  In ancient times, scholars in China and Korea really did spend a lifetime on this one text, not only sudying, but transcribing it, discussing it, and abiding by its tenets in their daily lives.  I've myself pored over it many times in Chinese, Korean and now English, and every time I read it I cannot but be amazed by the wisdom of Lao Tse (or, as some allege, the group of people who contributed to this text).  The problem with English, or I suppose any language not associated with Chinese, is that it is almost impossible to translate Tao Teh Ching with sufficient coherency.  Chinese words are each and all very efficient, in that virtually every single "letter" is replete with meaning.  Therefore, whereas the Chinese may use 10 words to describe something, English might require 10 times that words to adequately translate the meaning.  For example, in the second passage, third stanza, the translated text says, "therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without Ado."  What does "without Ado" mean?  In chinese this is stated in two letters as "Mu Wi" - non-action.  It does not mean to sit back and not participate or instigate any activity.  Rather, "Mu Wi" means doing things in a very natural, spontaneous way that is not forced, does not create conflict and has no secular motives.  As there are no secular motives behind the action, it is as if the Sage does not "act" in the way other poeple act.  His actions are like breathing, and almsot imperceptible; thus it is as if he does not act.  Concepts like "Mu Wi" and "Mu Ji" - non-knowledge - abound in Tao Teh Ching.  These cannot simply be translated away with a couple english words.  In short, a Tao Teh Ching ranslation requires pages and pages of footnotes to accurately reflect the rich meaning behind every passage.  Moreover, many passages can be read in more than one way.  In fact, different translations sometimes say radically different things about the same passage precisely because of this ambiguity.  Any serious translation of Tao Teh Ching should point these out.  Tao Teh Ching is very concise, and written in a poetic style.  But unless you are versed in ancient Chinese language and tomes, you should really consult the literally thousands of guides that scholars wrote over the years to help you read thru the text.  Tao Teh Ching is not some kind of Buddhist sutra that you can just recite over and over without knowing what it means.  It is deeply profound and rich with hidden subtexts.  In China and Korea many of these guides - some of them more than a thousand years old - still survive.  I've yet to find an enligsh guide.  But I am sure they exist.  PLease find them; refrain from reading the translation by itself, for most times all you will see are a jumble of meaningless words 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 While Mr. Hochheim may be an accomplished martial artist, and could probably slaughter me in a knife fight without breaking a sweat, this book is sub-par, even by knife combat book standards. This is another case of someone who is an expert in the area that they write about but who lacks the writing abilities to fully convey the concepts they present. Many of the illustrations in this book are handed to the reader without almost any written explanation of the techniques. The author seems to expect the reader to draw the necessary information from the pictures alone. For a combat expert this is fine, but for the novice this is less than satisfactory and perhaps even dangerous, if the student tries to perform the techniques in a real fight without a real understanding of how they should be properly executed 
 Ah, Pierre, you lusty Frenchman, where do you go wrong? Actually the main character Pierre is an American in the early 19th century who is well-off leading an easy life, until suddenly a mysterious woman crosses his path, who happens to be his sister, that he has rather strong feelings for, not to mention the creepy way he calls his mother sister in the early part of the book. Overly dramatic, it reads as if Melville made it up as he wrote, since so many crucial facts and events are suddenly mentioned with no foreshadowing or even hint of them. It does have a brief amusing chapter that attacks critics as people who praise medicore writers that risk nothing. Melville desperately wants Pierre to be like Shakespeare's Hamlet, butt alas, Pierre is much too flat and shallow for that. Aside from Melville Scholars, this novel isn't worth serious reading and skimming a few chapters would demonstrate it's many problems. Go for "Moby-Dick" or "Bartleby the Scrivner" for a real sense of Melville's writing 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 Absolutely one of the worst books of all time.  It took at minimum sixty pages to realize the heifer was missing and then it was downhill from there.  I had such high hopes for this book, but it is not worth your time, so don't bother.  I was mentally ticking off all bayous convenient to NOLA so at least half of the characters could be dumped.    I will give the author another chance, but if her main character is as snotty in the rest of the books, forget it.  That goes for the rest of the characters.     
 I think I never want to see  Another stanza by A.E.  I pity now the friends of Terence,  And eke his siblings, pets and parents.  For oh, good Lord the verse he made--  Too grim and too much in the shade:  The doomstruck lad, the Severn missed,  The Ludlow fair where he got pissed,  The London blues, the snow-hung orchard,  Young life cut short in syntax tortured,  And favorite of all his themes,  The Shropshire schoolboy's martial dreams.  Brave verse to stop a soldier shirking  By one whose work was patent-clerking.  "Stand up, be brave, lad, if you please,  So poets here may live at ease.  "And we shall rhyme and wring our hands  When you're cashiered in distant lands.  For really, 'tis not bad, the grave--  No care, no pain, no need to shave.  "So blah blah blah by Severnside,   And good for you, young suicide."  Well, he's dead too, now, old A.E.  Arrived where he most longed to be.  What's done is done, some good, much bad,  But still he toils, this Shropshire lad,  Producing yet from under plow  Some wholesome food for Shropshire cow 
 The recipes included are good, but this is not a "cooking" magazine. This is a women's fitness magazine in disguise. While I am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness, it shouldn't advertise itself as a cooking magazine. There is way too much other junk. If I wanted a makeover or an exercise routine, I don't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that. 
 Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  Check the laws in your local state. I'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! I had to trash mine. Thanks for taking my money 
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more "enjoyable" than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it. If only the monster had eaten this movie's negative, then we would all be spared 
 I bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another HP digital.  The camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used.  The delay between pictures is incredibly long.  The lens/shutter doesn't open properly.  (Two other family members who own Powershot A520's are having the same problems 
 I've purchased this CD based on huge popularity of previous albums on radio,good reviews on Amazon, plus this album always comes up as one of the bestsellers in Chill/Jazz/Electronica genre sections, of which I'm a big fan. Well, I was highly dissapointed after listening for 10-15 minutes, and could barely go through the end. They are not bad, it's good music, but nothing special. The sound and beats are too familiar from 90% of other Chill bands. I did not sense any originality,direction, and movement in any piece. Every piece flows and finishes the same way it starts. Wallpaper,wallpaper, wallpaper. The bottom line is that I've heard this million times before. Even vocals don't help this album. I wouldn't spin this album even if I owned a lounge. 
 It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie

 I gave this cookbook 2 stars because although it was exactly what I was looking for, it came in an unacceptable condition. My mother had the original book for as long as I can remember and it had become well worn. Pages were falling out of it. This book was for all intesive purposes the same. When I gave it to my mom for Christmas she was so excited. Unfortunately, the three ring binder on it was broken. This is very bad considering that you need them to turn the pages. I would say that considering it was brand new, this was unacceptabl 
 We got this for our new baby.  We loved it until tonight... it just up and died and I've only had it 19 days. Taking it back tomorrow 
 This is a great book to read to understand why Hilter is becoming more loved by young Whites then he was just a few years ago. The Chosen show their true mission; this is far better than the Elders Of Zion or even Klassen's books because it is from the horses mouth 
 Anybody who would name Jane Fonda as one of the most important women of the century under any catagory except traitor I would not buy or read any book or article that person wrote 
 Tour of Duty was just another example of the ineptitude of the Kerry people and how they underestimated the survivors, the real heroes of Vietnam. Perhaps Kerry, Brinkley and company thought that these brave heroes would forget or would not come forward or were dead.   Perhaps Kerry and his  minions thought that nobody would check and let Kerry get away with his flagrant lies about heroism. NOT ON OUR WATCH!  The title of t his book is also just another example of how Kerry tries to align himself with hollywood. In this case, taking a title that was a popular tv show. Sorry, but the actors in that tv show were better. The only comparison is that in both cases, it is all ficion. In the case of this book, the fiction part has been taken to an extreme.  Nice try, but this pr campaign to try to land Kerry a seat in the oval office didn't work. Too many people know the facts about Kerry.  I also recommend that you check out wintersoldier.com for more info on Kerry. The real John Kerry 
 I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst 
 Despite being a comedy show, this turned out to be a rather depressing experience. There were a few amusing bits here and there, mostly there, but the targets of the satire were very lame.  Most of the parodies are from pop culture in the 1990's, so they are extremely dated.  The "Information 411", "90210", and Yakmin Shirmnov sketches were particularly painful to watch, as bad as anything on SNL.  I only made it through the first 8 episodes, and skipped the last 5.  The commentary on episode 8 was more interesting (check out Garofalo screaming how she hated kissing a sock puppet because she hates "sexuality".  I still don't know what she meant by that) than the actual episode.  As we know, Ben Stiller became a star playing neurotic, clumsy nerds, Andy [...] has done a plethora of drugs and seems to be on the path of being the next Courtney Love (in terms of obnoxiousness and drug intake), Janeane does supporting roles in mostly forgettable (and sometimes wretched) films (even though she does have talent), and Bob Odenkirk did Mr. Show and recently (as of November 2006) directed the awful Let's Go to Prison.  The only sketches I remember in which I mildy laughed were the "B Minus Time Traveler" sketch.  Stick with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is still unsurpassed in sketch comedy.       
 Was hoping for/expecting a book with less of a religious bent to it.  Didn't realize when I ordered it that the answer to all the 'empty nest' problems and feelings, according to this book, is to pray and go to church and read certain sections of the Bible. Not good for people who want a psychological/secular read. 
 I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for.  After several listens, I still can't find even one song worth putting on a mix cd.  Come on, guys, you can do better than this 
 The author had a great idea for a book.  He collected enough 'meat' for about 30-50 pages and then exploded it into almost 500 pages of boring talk, so typical of many historians.    There are a few gems in this book and those few who manage to persevere through the boredom of the text may find it somewhat rewarding.  Had the author written a 50-page book that covers the essence of what he has to offer, this would have been a four or five star book.    
 "Whitehead" doesn't refer to something on the face.  Although, like puss spewing therefrom, the book is a morass of grotesque prose.  What is Whitehead getting at that so many scholars seem to ignore completely?  At the core of Whitehead's philosophy is "bifurcation of nature."  From this, Ph.D's have waxed eloquent and stated, "Aha, Whitehead is a panentheist," meaning, the universe contains a god like a spirit in the body.  Hmmmm.  Modern democrats espouse an unusually similar theory that cannot be coincidence.  Nevertheless, everyone has missed the point.  First and foremost, to his credit, Whitehead had great command over mathematics and modern ideas in science.  More noteworthy is the fact that quantum mechanics (micro physics) and relativity theory (macro physics) cannot be reconciled (unless we use Hermann Weyl's guage theory, which implements methods from group theory, which is nothing but mathematical formalism and reconstruction with no physical meaning).  The theories are irreconcilable since relativity predicts via E=mc squared that an electron, which approaches the speed of light, must approach infinity.  Yet, the physical fact is that an electron is of finite weight (although, I think a clue to this problem is in nuclear fission, aka the fact of the atom bomb).  Whitehead resolved to accept that both quantum mechanics and relativity theory are both true, or rather, complete unto themselves for the domain of physical phenomena they addressed, and resolved to accept they cannot be reconciled.  This resolution is formulated in his fundamental hypothesis about the bifurcation of reality.  Case closed 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, "DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson." This most difinitive "unproven" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he "seems" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what "reason" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.    From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. "Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study.   He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of "authority" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, "Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261)." His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct.   He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, "Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, "Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, "The Jefferson-Hemings Myth" are available through Amazon.   I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy......."Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve." I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of "another" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.

 This book really irritated me. I loved Mayes's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one. The concept, a year of traveling to different locations, seemed like it would be really interesting combined with Mayes' fresh perspectives, enthusiasm for discovery, feisty opinions and poetic descriptions. But somehow it didn't work.   I get the sense that her heart wasn't really in this book. Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years, and cobbled together? Or because there's so much `padding' - endless quotes from her own or other people's writing. When she liked the place, her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic, almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce. I got tired of reading that she could live there, or could imagine taking her grandson there, or wishes she was born there, or that it's SO much better than San Francisco. Where she doesn't live anymore, and hasn't for years. There are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think Frances Mayes is the nicest, most tasteful, most interesting person they've ever met. Especially since these people tend to be waiters, cab drivers, rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists.   Most of the book consists of sneering at her fellow Americans, or talking about people's personal appearance. This is boring and clichï¿½d - and if you like that kind of thing, Bill Bryson does it better. There's also way too much name dropping (she's always mentioning "my friend so-and-so, the famous ____"). What happened to the ordinary, financially stretched, middle-aged college professor? She seems to be taking on the persona of a celebrity. She doesn't want to be crowded in with a group, doesn't want to associate with ordinary tourist types - now she deserves the VIP treatment. This is definitely a change from her previous books.  I think when it comes right down to it, there's too much Frances Mayes in this book. I thought I liked her, but what I really like is her writing style. It can still be magical - when she gets her ego out of the way. But when she puts herself front and center, she becomes more tedious and pretentious than interesting. Now I'm sorry I read this book, because I'm afraid it will spoil my enjoyment of the earlier ones. 
 I picked up this book because I was interested in the trials and tribulations of product development.  It turns out that half the book is about Solly Angel's life, which I had no interest in spending time with.  Regarding the product development portion of the book....I am astounded that anybody with a degree in architecture design would make the lame brain mistakes that Angel makes from the get-go.  I only read half the book, but my advice to those whose interest is in product design is to flip through and read a bunch of pages to get a feel for it before buying it 
 Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.    In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.   Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.  Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.    Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.  Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid. 
 This movie is stupid beyond words. I watched a half hour of it and COULD NOT watch any more I was so lost and BORED. Makes no sense, talks about creepy gross and disgusting things, is boring and stupid!! Don't waste time on this dull as dust film 
 A normal Tour of Duty lasts 1 year. For Kerry, it only lasted 4 months. And in those four months, Kerry collected a record three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and a Bronz Star? C'mon! If this were legitimate, Kerry would be a bigger hero than Audie Murphy!  I know it's old news now. This book was intended to be and was a political tool to help Kerry become president in 2004. Kerry lost decisively. It's over. But for Kerry to say that he did all of these things is absolute nonsense. For Douglas Brinkley to claim this as  history as like a movie producer claiming a fiction movie of a action hero (perhaps played by Chuck Norris) is history and reality too! C'mon! And there are still people giving this book five stars?   PT Barnum would be proud of the efforts of Kerry and Douglas Brinkley.   HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME SEE THE COMMUNIST TRAITOR JOHN KERRY WHO FINKED ONHIS COUNTRY AND HIS COMRADES. HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME READ ABOUT THE MYTH OF KERRY'S HEROISM ALL FABRICATED BY KERRY AND ENDORSED BY DOUGLAS BRINKLEY 
 The kids had a blast with this toy.  I had a lot of kids over at Thanksgiving and it broke!  We had only been using it for 2 weeks?!?!! 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 I love del Toro's movies, but this was a major disappointment. Apart from a few nice visuals, this film has no redeeming quality. Every scene is predictable, badly acted, badly filmed, and not even remotely scary.  Furthermore, this movie features possibly the worst child actor in history of the world cinema. I'd imagine that a young girl (5? 6?) who's just seen her grandpa come back from the dead looking like a corpse would be freaking out, or show at least SOME sort of emotion. This child's face and body language were only a tad more alive than a plastic manequin, including the scene where she splits a man's skull open with a walking stick. For me, that drove the final nail into the coffin of this movie.  Skip this one, and see The Devil's Backbone instead 
 I've flipped through this book countless times while browsing my local library's knitting section and I'm always turned off by the boring and frequently ugly designs and color schemes. This author apparently has never met an earth tone she didn't like. How about adding a little sparkle to some of those muddier colors with some jewel tones? I can't speak for technique having never used the book. My advise is to browse through it at the library or book store before purchasing it here. Put it this way--it never inspires me enough to check it out of the library---for free! Of course, I'm not a big fan of her mother's book, Knitting Without Tears (I can imagine the gasps of outrage since she seems to be a knitting godess) and wish I'd spent my money on something less boring. I've had Knitting Without Tears for nearly four years now and have yet to use it for anything. It's just wasting space on my shelf. Since this book is a much bigger investment be wise and borrow a copy before buying 
 First of all, don't buy this book for the recipes.  They seem to be included to give the feel of the period, and aren't very interesting today.  That said, there are some worthwhile passages in this book, notably those that involve the author's bipolar mother. The problem is that the bulk of the memoir is larded with boomer-generation cliches: the motherly housekeeper, the exotic boarding school roommate, the high school 'fast crowd,' the exotic college roommate, the post-college communal household.  One cringe-worthy chapter in the middle is reminiscent of Neal Pollack's "I am friends with a middle-class black person"--minus the satire.  Finally, at the end, things just begin to get interesting as the author visits French vintners in the company of Kermit Lynch.  Perhaps the sequel is a better read.  For a far superior coming-of-age-with-food read, try Nigel Slater's "Toast." It succeeds more effectively on every level--and all he had to work with was British food!    
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Tells you what you should be doing but doesn't tell you how to do it. He explains what the quadrants are and goes in WAY too much detail describing the different types of people in these quadrants and does not tell you how to get from the employee quadrant to the investor quadrant. Makes suggestions like start a business or develop a business system. No mention on how to do that.   I just finished reading his Yahoo Finance article "A Taste for Debt" from 10/31/06 about upcoming tough financial times and he ends the article in typical Kioysaki (no explanation or in depth advice) fashion by saying "So what do I recommend? For now, enjoy the party, don't drink too much, and stay close to the exits".  Thanks for that Robert. I can't wait to not recommend and never buy one of your books again 
 My son read this book at the beginning of this school year (5th grade).  He struggles with reading and spelling.  He so totally identified with the main character, Sam, that he labeled himself dumb, stupid and learning  disabled.  This is not a triumphant story.  This is a tragic story.  The  protagonist does not feel he has overcome or mastered his learning  disablity.  Instead, he feels worn out and akins his small victory to  having swum a great distance, only to realize that he must do it again and  again.     I believe that there is a political agenda at work here.  Masked  behind an attitude of sympathy is the deeper message that children should  equate special education with learning disablities.  Furthermore, it  excuses the classroom teacher from having to deal with student difficulties  by making it not only okay, but acceptable BY THE STUDENTS to send children  from the room to another, "special" teacher.  Basically, this  leaves the gifted and talented in the main classroom and separates the  "normal" from the "not normal".  This book is  subversive and an insult.  It should not be in the classroom.  It gives  children access to a vocabulary that they cannot possibly fully comprehend  (nor, I suspect, does its author).  It provides students with tools to  label themselves, thereby easing the burden of the school systems.   Proponets of this book can only have the political and monetary protection  of the institution in mind when promoting it for classroom reading. While  seemingly innocent on the surface, a critical reader will see beyond the  surface to the deeper meaning and hidden agenda.  Of course, fifth graders  aren't critical readers, they are victims of school politics 
 I think I would have liked this book if I had read it when I was 14 or 15. Sweet, dreamy, simplistic. But I am much older and I was struck by the inconsistencies: The young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people; the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later - I lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest; the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel (in 1938??). Then there was the secretive, silent, and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked.  I was disappointed in this book. 
 This movie is a limp-wristed romantic comedy!  As a huge fan of broken lizard, I was looking forward to seeing this early work with fairly low expectations; Not expecting another super troopers but probably a low budget quirkily funny humor.  And yet I was still disappointed.  The amazing thing is there is no indiciation that the guys who made this movie would go onto do the hilarious off-beat comedies that they would subsequently create.  One major problem is that this film stars Steve Lemme, and he is clearly the weakest link among the five club dread guys.  He may be the best-looking, but he's the least funny and probably the worst actor of the troupe.  And his character is fairly unlikeable, a sort of bland and uninteresting twit, the typical lead in girlish date movies (which is what this is), made all the worse by Lemme's "serious" acting.  In their other movies, the broken lizard guys did well to limit Lemme's weaknesses.  In this movie, they highlight them.    Another problem is that the Freaky Reaky character, played by Eric Stolhnanske, is kind of lame and gets actively annoying at times.  This is probably the worst character the Broken Lizard guys have come up with yet.  It's this stock hippie stoner character who's supposed to be over the top, but actually just seriously grates.  A third problem is that they spend too much of this movie not telling jokes, but making an annoying, tepid, typical and uninspired romantic comedy.  Chandrasekhar, Heffernan, and Soter are pretty good in their roles, but their screen time, especially that of the latter two, is way too small.  There are some funny bits, but there's nothing here that is as ridiculously funny as their other movies.  One of the great things about Broken Lizard is that they've developed a fresh, distinctive, and original brand of comedy.  That is not in evidence here.  These jokes are stale and conventional.  The bonus featurette, rodeo clowns, showing their tour of colleges to promote this movie is often more entertaining, but is not enough to recommend this purchase.  Meanwhile the commentaries are frustrating, because these guys still seem to be suffering under the illusions that this is a good movie and that some of their crappy jokes are funny.  It would be more interesting if they talked about things they learned while making this and how they applied those lessons to making their subsequent movies comedic successes. 
 The power connector on my FS108 is very sensitive - try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit, flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection. My friend reports the same problems with his. Mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as I purchase a replacement - not another Netgear. A shame, it is otherwise a nice switch 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer.  Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase "Sophie said through her teeth..."  I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.  Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!  I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline 
 I am so very happy to read a couple of the honest reviews here that have revealed the DIS-honesty of Laurence Gardner and his Bloodline of the Holy Grail, especially with regard to his inability to prove his case.  But I am disappointed that no one seems to have touched upon this British [or European] penchant for "blood."  Though no one seems willing to admit or acknowledge this, this addiction to bloodlines, and the apparent obsessive need to tie all of European "royalty" to Jesus, smacks of a kind of racist, "Divine Right of Kings" that seems grounded in the old ideology (now dying out) called British Israelitism, with its argument that the Anglo-Saxon people are the "true Israel." [See: http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/britisra.htm. ]  Just read the various works of Gardner and other such authors.  All speculation, no facts.  But Gardner seems to know that he's found a marketing nitche: the remnants of the community of monarchists that range from the ordinary google-eyed monarcy-watcher, to such powerful groups as the European Council of Princes [see: http://www.royalhouseofstewart.org.uk/eurocoun.htm ]  Of course, if one ignores these "little" issues that I, and other reviewers here have pointed out, then Bloodline of the Holy Grail 'might' be considered a fascinating read.  That's why I gave it an extra star.  
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 This is a rather peculiar and disappointing book that reads as if it was written in a hurry. There are points where the text breaks down into short, disjointed and purely descriptive sentences that - given that this is supposedly an academic book - really makes one wonder what point the author is trying to make. Whilst the basic information is all good, there were a few inaccuracies, such as  in the chapter on Danny Elfman - the score of is Batman is NOT at the University of Texas in Austin, and the source she cites for the information is simply misquoted. Overall, in terms of Burton and his films, this doesn't offer anything obviously new, and parts of the book read like a precise of other authors rather than her own arguments. Her single unique selling point is looking at Burton's film making in the context of Alfred Jarry's pataphysics and the idea of surrealism (Jarry was one of the late 19th/ early 20th century figures who inspired surrealism). Nothing wrong with this - "surreal" is a commonly used adjective when discussing Burton's work - but overall the book comes across as rushed and flimsy. There's a good book in here struggling to get out, but it needed a good hard edit before being published 
 Reagan's campaign autobiography is titled _Where's the Rest of Me?_, based on a line from one of his movies.  Unfortunately, Cannon has amputated a lot of Reagan in the second volume of his biography.  (The other volume is Governor Reagan, and it is much, much better.)  Much of the book is based on leaks, kiss-and-tell interviews, and the various Iran-Contra reports.  As a result, the book is not a fair picture of Reagan but is really the revenge of administration officials.  As a result, the book has a lot of inside information, but Cannon has not put it in context.  Even worse, there is very little of Reagan in the book.  Most of the material describes what Reagan's staff is doing to each other, and there is plenty of in-fighting.  There's very little of Reagan's thoughts or actions.  For example, you get David Stockman's understandably bitter view of economic policy, but there is almost no discussion of the longest postwar economic boom, except an attempt to debunk it.  Mostly he portrays Reagan as asleep and uncomprehending.  It is highly telling that Cannon has not cited in his bibliography any documents from the Reagan library.  He only seems to quote Reagan's diary when it was used by the Tower Board during its investigation of Iran-Contra.  So this is a book about Reagan's chiefs of staff, counselors, and a few cabinet secretaries.  They are interesting people, but it's not a Reagan bio.  My final complaint is that the book is written in stream-of-consciousness.  Cannon describes whatever events he thinks of next, so there is little overall organization to the book.  He jumps years between paragraphs.  For instance, he doesn't mention the air-traffic controller's strike until he is discussing the re-election campaign, when it has only a tenuous connection to the matter at hand.  Major events are hardly covered at all, such as the assassination attempt.  So I still have no overall understanding of the themes and organization of Reagan's presidency.  Nonetheless, the book does have some strengths.  Cannon is an interesting writer, so you'll enjoy his prose.  He also has a lot of interesting inside information gained by his years as a reporter for the Washington Post and many years reporting on Reagan in California.  For example, he seems to have a good understanding of Nancy Reagan, probably because Michael Deaver was a key source.  Also, he provides insightfuly analysis about Iran-Contra, the MX missile deployment, the 1984 re-election, and the first budget.  His discussion of the different types of intelligence and the ones that were strengths for Reagan is very useful.  Note that even the revised version of the book ends with Reagan leaving the presidency in 1989.  It also begins with him taking office in 1981.  Overall, I CANNOT recommend the book.  It might be a good supplement if you already understand Reagan's presidency well.  But if this is the only book you read about him, you'll be left in confusion and with a biased portrait by a reporter who mostly seems to disparage Reagan 
 Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.  
 I found this book to be very boring. I bought it because I had seen it referanced in a lot of magazine articles. It may be good for looking up useful information on heart disease, but not really a preventative book. The diet recommended in this book is unrealistic to me and seems like a diet that would be recommended to a person who was diagnosed with heart disease and had to change their lifestyle 
 I thought the advice given was nothing new, cliche-ish and thus very uninspiring. The book often refers the reader to other books for what I believe it lacked--depth and focus. Also I disagree with the writers idea of how to handle anger. They mention how, in early editions of this book, they had encouraged readers to physically express anger safely but now recommend verbal expression instead. The importance of safe physical expression of anger is clearly and effectively explained in John Lee's "Facing the Fire"--a must-read for anyone having issues over anger especially suppressed anger left over from the past 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 The advice offered here will destroy your child's ability to trust you and thus the world around him.  This book is a pitiful excuse for parenting advice.  These methods are for parents who don't want to be bothered with parenting.  Parenting takes work: time, energy, patience, love, and much nurturing.  If you don't want to nurture a baby - then don't have one.  Don't try to make a baby learn to nurture herself - that is your job as a parent.  This book also has terrible views on breastfeeding, parental instincts, working mothers, and natural childbirth.  Please buy instead "Natural Family Living" by Peggy O'Mara. This is a true parenting book 
 Nice concept but the code refers to packages, interfaces and classes that don't exist.  Not deprecated, just not there to begin with.  And they're different enough that it really has no relevance to the actual technology.  Very disappointed 
 This book delivers many promises (and helps to re-kindle hope in a "cure"), but is overly simplistic.  I found it difficult to escape my insomnia even with following the guidelines in this book.  It is better than some books on this subject, but not the one that I would recommend.  The book called "Say Goodnight to Insomnia" helped me the most 
 Three years after the first mortal kombat film, fans couldn't wait for Annihilation to come out. Unfortunately, the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it, I can see why. First, I will start with what is positive about the movie. Kitana had more of a role as did Jax, I preferred Sandra Hess as Sonya a little over Bridget Wilson even though she did a good job with Sonya's character in the first movie, some of the fight scenes (Jax vs. Cyrax, Sonya vs. Mileena, Liu Kang vs. Baraka, Sub-Zero vs. Scorpion) were sequenced good, the dvd bonus features were nice, and the soundtrack was awesome. These positive aspects, however, could not save the overall film from disappointment. So what went wrong? Like the first MK, Annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie (mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3). Unlike the first MK, however, the blend was not successful. Too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent. Aside from that, only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return. What else went wrong with this sequel? Some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful. Shao Kahn's character along with Raiden's character was poorly resembled. Also, some of the characters didn't even get much screen time at all. One flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off (I won't say who because it is probably obvious). While some of the fight sequences were good, most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous. This goes double for the animality sequence. Sadly, MK Annihilation doesn't rank up with the first one. Despite all this, there is some good news. After eight long years of waiting, a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie. Plus, the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of Annihilation 
 This book is designed for someone who has prior knowledge with the underlying systems of a computer network.  It is fairly in-depth, and explains a lot, but I think that for a true beginner it is hard to comprehend.  I am working on a degree in Computer Science, so it wasn't like I was new to the idea of networking, but I found it hard to digest a lot of the technical aspects of this book.  Some things could have been made to be more of an overview, rather than in-depth explanation of how something works at a bit level.  I am now taking CCNA training, and some of the things talked about in this book do not relate at all to what someone needs to understand a working network.  
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 If I could give this book zero stars I would. This book was complete waste of money, the jewelry is uninspiring and the workmanship is so poor that I can't believe the author has actually managed to sell some of her creations. Most of the pages are filled with colorful and pretty pictures of beads but I didn't buy this book to see pictures of beads, I wanted to get ideas to create jewelry. There are thousand times better books out there, don't waste your money or time with this book 
 The premise was good and could have made for a good story line.  But come on, please.... am I really supposed to believe that Ben and Danielle can conduct all of these super human exploits with hardly a scratch?  They seem to pop up everywhere, just in time to save the day, while everyone else gets picked off like fleas!  Their wounds seem to heal supernaturally!  And then I'm supposed to believe that a pot head who's stupid enough to believe that he's going to get all A's for the semester because he's helping the government, can crack the computer code that none of the big boys can?  Nah...  I like my protagonists a little more human, capable of mistakes, and more believeable and thereby likeable.  I don't think I'll be reading any more of Land's books for a while.  This one supposedly took place over a 12 day period and that was about 11 days too long for me 
 This book is awful.  The blurb makes it sound like a story of ostracism in high school, but the characters are cardboard-flat. It's more of a preachy spiritual trip for the author than a story.  There's no reason for the narrator, Justin, to befriend the school outcast (who is a Christian-raised white boy trying to live as a Buddhist monk). The narrator's friends are bratty and too obviously shallow. The school bully is a stock stereotype who does all the predictable bully things. I got about halfway through and quit. 
 This is VERY small. It's too small for a play kitchen. And you only get one not two like is pictured 
 As for digital technology, monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth.  The great difference with the digital output/inpt devices compared to analog is simple.  If the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it can't be any more or less clear.  Because your digital signal is comprised of "0's" and "1's" if you can see your TV or hear the music then what ever cable you use works-  There is no distortation across digital signals, so don't pay the extra money- In fact you shouldn't need to spend more than around $30-50.  
 Josh McDowell's "Handbook or Today's Religions" is a comprehensive book, and covers a lot of material. Each religion covered is necessarily brief, but the main points are covered and should give someone a basic idea of what each religion is about.   It should be remembered that McDowell is not writing from a purely intellectual and neutral stance, but is attempting to show why non-Christian religions are false. This really could be termed a work of polemics, though somewhat softer than the venomous prose of Tertullian. Before considering buying this book, it should be remembered that McDowell does have an agenda in writing it, and he is not neutral about the religions he discusses.  As an adjunct to that agenda, McDowell will attempt to show why, from a Christian viewpoint, these religions are "wrong". That he would include his opinions should come as no surprise to anyone, seeing that he is a Christian and has a purpose other than merely describing these religions.  One the bonus side, McDowell does not get into the overly technical language, and keeps it aimed at people who have had little to no exposure to the religions concerned. He has written a very accessible book.  For Christians, the book has undoubted value. For others, there are much better and more neutral books available that do the same thing. Or even better, get the information straight from the source itself and read the religion's books for yourself. They are far more interesting, anyway, despite the large amount of time that it may take you 
 Anne Bishop should stick to the kind of storytelling she does best.  Everything she wrote based in the world where the Black Jewels Trilogy took place is wondrous. The Pillars of the World series read as if she was trying to write an interesting series.  Sebastion was a waste of time and money, I cancelled the others in that set. Sebastion is just too contrived, there's no heart and soul to the writing 
 Be warned!  This book is not about science!  I don't know know who this Henry Miller fellow is but he doesn't know anything about geography.  Imagine my surprise when I purchased this book--expecting to read about the earth's different latitudal circles--and discovered it has nothing to do with the Tropic of Cancer or any other latitudal lines!  In fact, the so-called "author" can't even seem to WRITE in a linear fashion!  I've heard that this "author" has a book about the Tropic of Capricorn out but I'm willing to bet that that one has nothing to do with latitude either!  
 I am a big fan of Cassandra Wilson and was duped into buying this disc after reading reviews here and elsewhere. I knew after the first 3 songs that trouble was brewing as they all sounded alike. Indeed, the entire thing suffers from the same muddy mix and monotone vocals. What a waste. No diversity in song selection and no vocal range. She should lose T-Bone Burnett for her next effort. *Note* She has displayed this same poor judgment in concert with her song list 
 I struggled quite a distance into this book because I love France, but finally I gave up. I found the author to be a poor writer, found her stories to be so farfetched that I decided that she was not being truthful, found her values to be very superficial, found her to be describing things that were not worth reading about--e.g., the car trip to St. Tropez, and her apparent fixation on sex--e.g., her negative descriptions of the way females dress and act in St. Tropez, and her imagings about her husband's indiscretions with the Prince's wife and his dalliance with the girls in the village. Who cares if it happened! Who cares what the author imagines about her husband! You might think her husband would care and the Prince and the Princess would care. I doubt that there even is a Prince and Princess. And if the picture of the author half in a shadows, on the book cover is an example of her professional photographer husband's work, forget it.  With the car trip to St. Tropez, I couldn't take anymore. I took the book back and got a refund 
 After about a month, it started producing cool-mist that smelled funny, like something bad had rotted in the room. The filters are a nuisance. I think I'm much better off with a steam vaporizer 
 Didn't like the book as it was really out of date, most items in the book have been done years ago, and it didn't show me anything new 
 I don't even own this but I know all the artists on this album. This album is loaded with horrible pop stars, modern rappers, and punk-pop bands! And to say there's 21 tracks! More like 21 tracks of bullsh i t!  Let's describe this album. The album starts with Mariah Carey an incredibly overrated pop singer, I have no clue why everyone likes her. Next are the Pussycat Dolls who are absoulobtly terrible and this song may be the worst song on this compilation! Nelly is another abysmal pop rapper. Chris Brown is an awful heartthrob guy who promotes selling out. Black Eyed Peas, refer to Nelly. Rihanna refer to the Pussycat Dolls except it's dancehall. Bow Wow is very terrible. Dem Franchize Boyz... no comment. Their name is retarded enough. Three 6 Mafia, overrated as fu c k. T-Pain, sucks even worse than those other rappers/R&B singers on this sh i t compilation. Ray. J, no wonder no ones heard of him. Kelly Clarkson is very overrated and the song on here in insanely boring. Natasha Bedingfield is like Coldplay, people only seem to like her because she's British. Nickelback, basically Creed rip-offs. All American Rejects are yet another fu c king horrible punk-pop band. Fall Out Boy, no comment on how bad they are. Relient K are just a nightmare to think of! They're a christian punk-pop band!!! Gorillaz(RIP) have sold out and become very mainstream just like Black Eyed Peas(RIP) and Green Day(RIP). Trace Adkins is some country poser. Cascada is a horrible techno pop singer. And that concludes this horrible compilation. Hope you enjoy it 
 I surely wouldn't reccomend buying this dinosaur. Bought it online and it never did work. Panasonic "support" was as bad as it's DVD. One support specialist told me to unplug it and then plug it in again. Another was reading from a list of "What to do if the caller says this." The repair shop gave me the idea that Panasonic no longer makes this product. They couldn't find a replacement part so they are replacing my DVD. In all I've waited over a month and a half to watch my $299 DVD player and I still haven't got a new one from the repair shop. If your smart don't purchase one of these antiques 
    This book is absolutely disgusting! Oh it'll teach your kids how to have sex alright! It will also teach them the "fun and friendly" way to masturbate have group sex and different sexual positions all in full color pictures!! It will teach them that they can have sex, whether normal or perverted, without any fear of consequences. But perhaps the worst atrocity of this book is that it teaches girls to abort their babies. It even gives nine 'perfectly normal' reasons why a girl should abort. Of course they fail to mention all of the consequences and after effects post-abortive women go through. Not to mention killing their own child. Please! Please! Do not subject your children to this piece of garbage 
   I have to say the quality of the movie as far as picture and sound is just about perfect. I however didnt laugh at all during the whole movie. It is predictable and full of stupid characters. I guess its for fans only 
 Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for.   
 Irving is one of my top favorite authors...but I was SO disappointed in "Until I Find You." I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought they were all miserable and just plain pathetic. I held out until about page 600 until I gave up and put the book down. I didn't even care to know what happened to the main character, Jack, at the end.   Jack's mother is a tattoo artist. The book goes into heavy detail about tattooing, which I found totally unnecessary and frankly, a distraction from an already convoluted plot. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book I still couldn't figure out what exactly we were supposed to care about with this plot.   Was the whole point that that people are misguided, confused and damaged? Who knows. The characters were just so annoying and unlikeable that I found it to be a real chore to read this book.   Read ANY of Irving's other books before this one. 
 This CD should have been called "The Most Annoyingly Overplayed Songs of the 1990's." With the exception of "Shine," every single track on this CD is juvenile, mindless, fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream! If you're looking for a CD that represents the greatest music of the 1990's, check out Non Stop 90's Rock or Forever 90's instead.  However, you might be interested in this CD if you want to host a cheesy 90's dance party. The songs are kind of fun and catchy if you listen to them in moderation 
 Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have never been known for installing a sense of reality in their stories. You have to suspend disbelief in order to truly enjoy their tales. But Brimston crosses a line that should never be crossed. The story is so far-fetched, so totally unbelieveable that it just becomes intolerable for the reader.   Agents Pendergast and officer D'Agosta are back to solve yet another mysterious crime. This time, people are combusting into flames. There is no clue at the crime scene save for different images burnt into the walls next to the victims and traces of brimstone found in and around the victims. Soon enough, the  devil is being suspected.   As the crimes put the city in a fury, the agents are sent to Italy to investigate one of their prime suspects. As they keep putting themselves in iffy situation, people seem to be out to get them. Soon enough, the agents become the hunted. And the race for time begins.  The premise itself is promising, but the characters always get themselves out of situation in such ridiculous ways that you just stop enjoying yourself after a while. As our agents are held captive with their hands tied, their eyes bandaged and guns pointed at their backs, one of them just happens to have a nice little set of tools sown in the hem of his shirt. So he uses it to free himself. And this isn't even the most ridiculous scene in the novel.   And as you get close to the end, instead of building, the momentum just seems to halt for nearly 75 pages. When the story takes some steam again, you're just not interested anymore. And the story also reveals a very unnecessary subplot that takes place in New York City while our agents are in Italy that brings nothing whatsoever to the story at hand. Why include that in your novel? Why drage your story for nearly 800 pages when a third of it just sets you back and kills the momentum?  Preston and Child can write good thrillers. Their books are usually breathless and fun. But Brimstone suffers from the less is more syndrome. Everything is so overblown and out of context that I just couldn't enjoy the ride, no matter how hard I tried. Maybe the authors should concentrate more on plot points to give us something tighter and more thrilling. 
 A lovely dry compilation of speeches, articles, and analysis of the wonderful world of management. Bought it for a class and found it riddled with typos and boredom.  Enjoy 
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 I hated this book!  I thought that the heroine acted like an idiot.  Not that the hero didn't, both of them tried to be so upstanding and moral.  Give me a break!  This is a romance novel not a treatise on philosophy 
 I feel bad rating this book so low but I also don't want to rate it higher because I hate this book. The only reason why I read this book was because I had to read it for my english class at school. If it wasn't for the class there is absolutely no way I would have read this book. the teachers thought that we should read a civil war novel for english because were doing a civil war unit in social studies. Before we even started the novel I thought we were doing plenty of civil war, but no we have to do even more civil war. I probably wouldn't have such a hard time with this book if I didn't have to do school work with. I had such a hard time understanding some parts of this book because the family had so many people in it. I struggled to read this book every night not only because it was boring, but because I had to try to understand it so I could do the work that went with it. The only thing that happens in this book is in the begging the civil war is about to start and then some people from this family fight in the war and then they write letters to the family. Thats litteraly the only thing that happens in this book. In my opinion this book was boring and I would not recomend reading it, unless you really want to because you have nothing else to do 
 "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser is considered one of the greatest American books ever written.  This may be the case if you can get past the first chapter.  Five times, I have tried to read this book.  To date, I am 0 for 5, having fallen asleep each time trying to read it.  If you're a bit of a lazy reader or one who doesn't want to work through a book, this is not for you.  Try Mark Twain instead 
 I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.  Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting.  Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.  I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable 
 My son is a Junior in High School and brought this 5th Edition book home last week.  I spent an hour going through this book and I have to tell you that I am disappointed in the content.  It lacks historical information and focuses on Social issues.  I want my son to know the historical information behind these social issues.    It is sad that so much of our history is no longer being taught in our schools in favor of diversity 
 I have traveled to China and am fascinated by the country.  I looked forward to this book and as I started to read it, the bginning fulfilled all my ideas of the early twentieth century in China,  tidbits about living there and the white russians.  I eagerly read and then realized that the book had lost it's potential.  I am sorry that the author's two brothers had lost their way and even more sorry that his oldest brother committed suicide but I lost all desire to read the book. It is almost like he is still coming to terms with the death.  ANytime some relative does something that drastic, it is traumatizing but after a while it became less about China and more about life outside China.  Of course that is where I stopped reading so I didn't know if he got back on course.  Still I would have hoped that the actual life in China as a child would be more interesting.  What about his sister and what it was like for a girl born in the 1920's in China?  It seems Frank was the only one who mattered and the suthor's sister is bearly a footnote.   Did the family learn Chinese or not?  Did they live in an isoltaed european word or did they take in the chinese atmosphere, description of housing, clothing, a read feell for China would have been a better read than all the non-chinese section 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Off Season is a tale of city vacationers running afoul of a family of savage cannibals in rural Maine.  The gore quotient is over-the-top and the story is really simplistic with very little character developement. Though this was supposed to be a trendsetting book, at the time of its release in 1980, for its unflinching depictions of violence, it is really not that shocking.  Any group of middle-schoolers could have thought up the gross scenes in Ketchum's Off Season. It's really so cartoonish and ridiculous that it loses any shock value. Mutilation of people in ever more brutal ways by predators that are as unbelievable as the villians in Batman just seem silly and I'm not sure who the intended audience is. Ketchum has written some truly effective and shocking literature in his career (see Girl Next Door or Lost) and this reviewer counts himself among his fans, but Off Season is truly a big-to-do about nothing.  Any critically thinking adult would be bored by this story and any child living an the era of Grand Theft Auto video games the Final Destination movie series would see this for what it is, substandard generic Horror without much redeeming value 
 This book is truly horrible in every possible way.  The book is extremely redundant (obviously to fill up pages in an effort to make a longer book out of minimal material), and is full of trivial and inconsequential information about Dr. Levine's young subjects.    Evidently, Levine is very pleased with his lame attempt at being an entertaining writer, but the truth is that this is the most poorly written book of any kind ever produced!  It is full of the most ridiculous examples of verbal circumlocution that I have ever witnessed.  These polysyllabic phrases alternate with other sections that are extremely provincial and that seem to often digress from the subject at hand.  Even though the author apparently has fairly extensive scientific training (Levine is an M.D., after all), this book is totally unscientific--full of personal antecdotes and conjecture, without  any references to scientific studies and without any comparisons to control groups or test subjects.  There is also no consideration given to the large number of variables that are affecting each of Levine's patients that he writes about here.  Basically, the book is simply a collection of euphemisms for describing laziness and other character weaknesses and flaws.  The labels that Levine uses, such as "mental energy dysfunction", "energy crisis", "low motor turnout",  "extreme social distractibility", and "active-working-memory dysfunction" are laughable.  What the poor young subjects written about in this book really need are parents, teachers and other adult mentors who actually care enough about them to have high expectations of them.  They need adults who are willing to make them behave, do their homework, go to bed on time, etc.  Having their negative characteristics simply given more flattering names is not going to help these poor young subjects one bit.  This book does have a catchy title (a good hook), but there are many other books that address the same subject that are so much better.  I could only recommend this book to those who suffer from extreme insomnia.  I guarantee that it WILL put you to sleep fast 
 Unfortunately the book didn't uncover any "secrets" whatsoever as the title alludes to.  The information contained in this book is very basic.  I found one major problem with the text in that it encourages "component depreciation".  My research and understanding is that this was clearly outlawed in the US in the 1980s.  When I contacted the publishing company for clarification, no one would answer this simple question.    If this book was filled with high quality ideas, I would have overlooked an error or two and given this book 4 or 5 stars.  But that wasn't the case as I've only been in the real estate game for a short time and already knew most of what is contained in this text.  All in, this book isn't even worth the $5 +shipping I paid for it used... 
 In all honesty, this book was severely lacking in just about every area. It wasn't horrible. I didn't mind reading it, but there were just so many problems with the story as a whole, so many poorly developed aspects that kept it from being a truly good read. The story was very two-dimensional, lacking development and depth. It was just very superficial.  The characters have very little depth or exploration. The authors give you some basic history, but fail to really explore them. They mention things but then never really tell you about them. An example is Maggie's pregnancy. You know that the antagonist got her pregnant at a young age, and you're told that there was some sort of cover-up to get her out of town so no one would know. But they never give you any details. You have no idea exactly how old she was, and you're not told anything at all about this cover-up. Where did she go? What did she do? How did she handle it all? Why did she make up a husband? It would have been nice to have these details and it would have given another dimension to Maggie's character.  Zack's was in a similar state. You know his FBI step-father was killed by the antagonist but you learn little else, other than that Zack was greatly affected by the slaying. I wanted to know how old Zack was when his mother married his step-father, what their relationship was like, how he dealt with the man's death, etc. Again, knowing all this would have made the character more full-bodied. The authors just failed to give these characters any depth at all.  The romance between them was poorly developed as well. It seemed extremely forced, with very little emotion involved. It was like, hey, let's kiss; hey, let's have sex; hey, I think I might have feelings for you. I wasn't feeling the chemistry between them at all. I had a really hard time believing that these two characters were in love.  There were also some minor areas where issues bothered me. One was that Zack, as an FBI Agent, was allowed to participate in the case at all. He was personally connected (his father being killed by the antagonist 14 years earlier). I had a hard time buying that that would be allowed. Also, Destiny, who had roles in the other books, is done a serious injustice in this book. She's paired off and engaged with hardly a whisper. A little more on that would have been nice.  As for the good points...well, I enjoyed the cameos of Max and Jamie. Fleas the hound dog and Butterbean the goat were great. And the actual plot wasn't too bad. But none of that could overcome the holes in the book. I was rather disappointed overall once I finished.  Rating: 2 / 5 
 Save your money and buy a beatuty product instead.  This book is very repetative and has not much content.  You can find more and better info on the net.  In my opinion produce is much too expensive to be used as beauty products.  I would rather eat it.  I do not feel like putting milk on myself, lemons everwhere, drinking diluted vinegar, scrubbing with coffee grounds.  Yeah you cover up dark roots on your hair with eyeshadow. If you heard the promo on TV about what was in the book that is about it that is it not much more info.      In case we did not get it the first time they keep repeating the same thing over and over and over again 
 I used to think should never judge a book for the cover. But this time I was wrong. The book is plenty of average wedding photos. It's a sort of frustrating to try to be inspired by a book where the pictures are so standard, conservative and uncreative.  But the worst of all is that there is almost no direct relation between most of the pictures and the text. They are no real examples of what the text describes and there are only a few schemas for covering the topics explained.  I wanted a posing book but only a few chapters cover this area. For me 70% was un-useful information. Sometimes the author tries to teach you about depth of field or how to use a ladder and the possible complications you can having using it. If I wanted to read about lighting, well then I would buy a lighting book written by a master of lighting. For example, this guy don't know the existence of the big and expensive studio/fashion ring flashes and he adjudge the circular catch lights in fashion portraits to powerless macro ring flashes.  This book should be named: "The Wedding Portrait Photographer, a basic guide to photography".  I don't give this book one star because, yes!, there is still very useful posing information on it 
 This toy was such a disappointment that i sent it back.  The balls are so small and cheap, and the toy itself looks very cheaply made.  I didn't even let my kids see it before I sent it back 
 obviously, the music featured here is of high-quality.  hardly sign of the times transcendent, but nonetheless very exciting (as was typical of prince's 2002 tour).  unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound, hamfisted camera angle switches, bizarre washed-out colors, some horribly cheesy effects and cuts.  for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity, it's a shame the director clearly hasn't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber.  hey prince, just so you know....your DIY "NPGMC" approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you.  if it looks this amateurish then you just look, well...amateurish.  and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation.  the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this.   i mean really, you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par: i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this.    hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this, but casual fans (especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert) should definitely avoid.  
 Although often touted as a horror comedy, the most amusing aspect of this 1997 direct-to-video clunker is the fact that it is often confused with its saccharine family-flick namesake, a commensurately clunky and similarly themed Michael Keaton vehicle released in theaters the following year. Interestingly, the titular character of each film is a snowman that has somehow come to life. However, those planning a nice evening with the youngsters will be in for quite a shock if they purchase or rent the wrong movie. The snowy dude in Keaton's film is a benevolent father figure who wants to help out his real-life family; the icy hombre in the 1997 horror flick is animated by the soul of an escaped convict with a penchant for rape and murder.  Outside of the amusing thought of 1997's JACK FROST getting an accidental showing at a kiddie party, this film has very little to offer. The special FX are amateurish, the script is so inane that it is nearly impossible to suspend one's disbelief for the duration, and much of the acting is horrid. While some films can be admired for their cheesiness--Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD (1981) comes immediately to mind--JACK FROST falls way beneath even THAT standard. Writer-director Michael Cooney seems unable to decide if he wants to spoof the horror genre--there are scenes that mimic horror cliches but few, if any, that parody or satirize them--or simply make, a la Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984), a scary film with humorous characters and an amusing premise. The film vacillates between both styles without gaining sufficient footing in either, and the result is a slushy thematic jumble that is neither scary nor entertaining.  JACK FROST is not without a few near-redeeming qualities, however. There are lots of amusing Python-esque puns and jokes sprinkled throughout the film, the kind of verbal gags that make you simultaneously chuckle and...well, GAG. And this film also marks the cinematic debut of gorgeous actress Shannon Elizabeth, who here has some, ah, revealing moments with the eponymous snowman. Unfortunately, these elements do not elevate the film enough to make it worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of one's life.  Don't be fooled by the artwork on the DVD's packaging--that cool skull made of snow does not appear in the film. In truth, 1997's JACK FROST is an ice-cold stinker that few discerning horror fans will want to add to their collections 
 It is unfortunate that upon considering this book, that one should, if honest to themselves, undertake a study to see if Bellesiles' peer historians have "signed off" on it.  Having read the exhaustive 50+ page report: "Fall from Grace: Arming America and the Bellesiles Scandal" by JAMES LINDGREN of Northwestern University Law School, one discovers that the all of the fifteen "major contentions of Arming America turn out to be false." (save that the militia was ineffective), in a well documented fashion.  Also the work of Clayton Cramer document (often with actual copies of original documents from the period) what appears to be the art of historical revisionism at its highest.  This book is now regularly cited in University classes as an example of research and peer review failure.  If you are hoping to study the history of fradulent and unprofessional research, or failures in academic review, I should say you have found your book.  If, on the other hand, you wish to discover anything factual about guns and early America, you have no legitimate choice but to look elsewhere. 
 I was disappointed to find that this book was written in comic book form.  I was anticipating an actual story that I could share with my son.  The best thing about this book is the abundance of photos, but not worth the $7.99 price tag 
 I am a GIS student who's also gone through most of a computer science degree and so I know Visual Basic and lots of other kinds of programming, but going through this book is one of the more tedious and confusing things I've done. Granted, MapObjects is a fairly large library and object set, but the author makes it worse in several ways. First, he deliberately gives you code in some places that doesn't work, only to correct it later on. This may be an admirable attempt to get you to learn it and think it through, but it just doesn't work - it's too large a set of objects and methods to keep track of, so trying to keep track of things which aren't even supposed to work makes it worse. Furthermore, in several places he does this, he changes some parts of the code, but forgets to change other parts that the original changes make neccessary to change, and one is left with a confusing mish-mash of partially edited code that doesn't look like the pictures in the book and doesn't always work. It is almost as if the author himself can't keep track of what's going on. Finally, his explanatory method of writing down large chunks of code with *short* descriptions afterwards doesn't really help. It would have been much better if he explained each component one-by-one, possibly even isolating them from other components where possible, and also made the code as simple as possible *without* having the deliberate errors. When you're learning something as complicated as this, the smaller the chunks, the better - and it's really nice to have code that works and runs right from the start so you can really see how it works (instead of not being able to see how it works due to deliberate errors) 
 George is obviously cashing in on his undeserved celebrity status. I hope this book is in the children's section. It's exactly what I expected: a $15 book version of his unrehearsed, unrifined, child-like stream of conciousness. I wonder what this book would have been like without a co-author--unpublishable at the least I'm sure.   I'm sorry, George seems like a sweet man, but he's one of those people you meet in life that just exudes low IQ/ young soul. I listen to his radio show almost every night because of the great guests (albiet some are kooky, nonetheless entertaining), but I have to turn it off sometimes because I am so frustrated with George's incompetence as an interveiwer. It's almost laughable at times. I'm not sure he even prepares questions or researches, which is a huge disservice to his guests and audience. He's really in the wrong line of work. I'm not simply comparing him to former CtoC host Art Bell either. Any other interveiwer out there has the respect of having complete preparedness for guest and audience.  He seems to lack the little 'weigh station' between your thoughts and your mouth. He has an annoying habit of referencing lines from movies he's seen recently but mangling them because he can't remember them, and then not illustating his point to boot. Or he'll say things like, "Its like that movie "Of Mice and Men"... It's more famous as a book George! I honestly don't know how he made it through college. Almost every night it's something like that. Last night it was "OK say you take 10 people, what per centage of them have prophetic dreams?" How about 22% George? Does that work for you?  I'm only writing this because I care about the format--it's good radio for late night. When he and Richard Hogland get together they sound like a couple of 10 year old boys in a treehouse club.  Anyway if you or your crew is reading this George, please prepare for your guests, hire a couple sharp inters to prepare questions and research. You have your computer in front of you, look up things you want to say before you say them. Don't write anymore books please. Don't be such an opportunist 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 Wow and to think that those 10 billion people who lived throughout history could have extended their lives by doing the most primitive stretching exercises and breathing in a controlled manner, AMAZING. To bad Buddha, the founder of buddhism, never discoverd these secrets. He would have been shocked 
 Franz Kafka's 'Amerika' started off, to me, with a great premise, but in the end I found the tale less than entertaining.  Karl Rossman, a teenage boy shipped off to America by his parents following an 'indiscretion' with a servant girl, finds himself in the company of an American uncle, who quickly shuns him for accepting the hospitality of one of the uncle's friends.  Rossman then 'disappears' into the poor working class landscape of America, where he encounters many less than scrupulous characters.  Much of this novel is devoted to the this 'disappearance', though the action, to me, never quite moved along...and made the story quite stale to me...  While I have not read any other works by Franz Kafka, I hope that other novels were better paced and executed. His prose is enjoyable, just not very 'lively' in this offering.  
 It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.  The Good: Unique and challenging puzzles; handy hint system helps keep the game moving.  The Bad: Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear; blurry, low-res backgrounds; dull characters and an uninteresting story 
 I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.  So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a "blue juice special". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money 
 This book is NOT an attempt to dispassionately analyze the truth about the Da Vinci Code, but rather an attempt to debunk it.  The only book I have seen which looks at the Da Vinci Code objectively is a book by the SCHOLAR Bart D. Ehrman, Fact and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code.  THAT'S a book worth reading; not this pathetic attempt 
 I bought this book because my son started talking about outer space and rockets, etc... I also bought it because we have several other Byron Barton books and my son really enjoys reading and looking at. However, this book is a little boring, doesn't keep his interest and isn't on the same level as the other Barton books 
 I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me.  It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible.  If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge.  I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire.  
 While musically James McMurtry has talent, the message of his album and especially the hit song "We Can't Make It Here"  is outdated and unrealistic. In the song McMurtry laments about shirts being made in Singapore and the problems of outsourcing jobs, among other ridiculous things. It seems he would like to live in the world of the 1950s. While appealing on the surface, it is a waste of time to think like this.   McMurtry should realize that oursourcing is a reality and American companies have no choice. Nor is this a new issue. Shirts being made in Singapore? Give me a break -- he should find a real cause to wail against, not one that was lost years ago 
 This book is always advertised, yet NEVER in stock after you pay for it.  I've tried to order it from 4 different people and all 4 didn't actually have it.  
 This is book has a wealth of information on the early years of fibre optics that I have not seen anywhere else. It is full of names and brief explanations of their contribution. But overall I thought this was a dull,  slow moving book with little insight. More of an ongoing collection of  notes that have been put together for another better book on the history of  fibre once the real story finally emerges.      There is very little  science here. You won't learn much about light physics or why the  technology works -only that it does and who patented it. (But the science  may be reserved for Hecht's other book.)      Also , for those who are  trying to keep up with Gilder this book will be disappointing. There is  nothing on DWDM (one brief, unexplained mention) or  nothing that maps out  the current players, companies,  or  technologies. (I can tell that Gilder  has read it because some of the historical facts have been mentioned in the  GTR) But there are only a few pages at the end that try to update where the  technology has been in the last 10 years, where it is going or why. Huge  gaps where a technology is mentioned but not even defined, much less  explained. I wish there was a better book on the subject, but for now this  is it, and maybe it is worth reading for that reason alone. Sorry to be so  critical, but if you like Burke's "Connections" this will only  get you lost. It probably would not have been published but for the sudden  surge in tech stocks. I hope the Slone series is not all like this 
 After waiting years for a bio about the magnificent Kay Kendall, Eve Golden's effort is little more than tin.  The book is a laundry list of Kendall's personality quirks and defects (film stars documented as self-centered is a revelation?) and completely misses the mark.  Kendall was so extraordinary and special as an actress, and this book, tragically, misses that which clearly made her so memorable.  Several of Kendall's films are watchable only due to her presence and there is no mention of that here.  Golden has chosen to focus on the personal details at the expense of Kendall's charm and uniqueness as a performer.  It seems that cooperation of Kendall's sister, Kim, was necessary to provide documentation about their childhood and early careers, however, this doesn't seem to have helped the book much.  Previous bios on Rex Harrison have better captured the essence of Kendall's star quality (i.e. Alexander Walker's).  Noel Coward's diary entry for Kendall's London stage performance in THE BRIGHT ONE does more to illuminate this great actress than this book:  "Went to see a dreadful play in which Kay Kendall was enchanting..."  THAT was Kendall's gift.  This book does nothing to endorse that consensus 
 If you are familiar with the usual "messie" terms, I would say Ms. Barnes is "born organized". She talks about how she helped her mother from early on keeping up the house and a business. She  apparently was never at a "total mess". If you are completely  disorganized and don't know where to start, this book probably will not  help you. There are some sections on closets and the kitchen that give you  directions on organization 
 Hello!  I was STUNNED by how badly written this book was. ESPECIALLY as one of the authors is supposedly a department chairman at Cornell University! The same unimportant items are repeated over and over and over throughout this short (large type, few words on page) book. Paragraphs or sections start out describing something, get a third or halfway through the thought, then stop abruptly with the authors apparently forgetting to include the needed information to finish the paragraph or section.  The Columbine school shootings are mentioned repeatedly, for no particularly useful reason that I can see, other than to "cash in" on the incident. A single mention of this incident would have been far more than enough to make the few points they wanted to make about it.  A totally useless 8 page or so section, goes on to describe special needs of RICH(!) parents to deal with their children! Special care was taken to describe how wonderful the rich were who could save wealth (I would imagine that this is how the authors view themselves. WHAT was this doing in this book in the first place???). No such special section on child advice was included for either middle class, or poor parents. I found this section to be particularly insulting to just about everyone.  The authors in several places in the book say directly or indirectly how wonderful they are, or how wonderful their book is. This was galling and completely unneccessary.  While touting the book as offering detailed advice on child rearing, this is in essence an outright lie. The little advice they offer is so vague as to be virtually useless.  To save all of you the trouble of reading this book, here are the few points they made: love your child, listen to your child, give your child firm structure and guidance. That's about it. This is just about as detailed as they got with their advice. As you will note, their "advice" is virtually useless in helping parents with specific child rearing problems.  I have read NUMEROUS, much, much better books on child rearing; that quoted research, and then, IN DETAIL, gave many specific, detailed techniques that any normal parent could use with their children. Not ONE single detailed technique was EVER mentioned in this book. NOT ONE.  While research is quoted in this book from time to time, it is mainly along the lines of, "Ain't life horrible nowadays?" In other words, they mentioned many problems, BUT, no solutions. Virtually NO studies were quoted that described solutions to parenting problems.  I am still stunned that Simon and Schuster published this (the hardback edition). I could have forgiven the very poor writing if there had been useful parenting information in this book, but there was none.  I would have given this book ZERO stars if I had been allowed to.  MANY other books are available that are light years ahead of this book in every possible way; please look there for child rearing advice.  Kar 
 I jumped at the idea of buying this book because I wanted to get tips for planning my New York based- Latino wedding. Clearly for someone like me who is from a Latino/Caribbean country it was not particularly helpful.  Most of the book focused on what I characterize as more Mexican traditions. I can't really say that any of the vendors or sites that they suggest are good ones for New Yorkers or those of us that live in the Northeast. I'd love to find a book that focused more on Cuban, Dominican or Puerto Rican wedding traditions. I guess I'll have to keep searching 
 Eric Schiller frustrates me.  He has great breadth as a chess writer (I am not yet good enough to be able to critique whether he has "depth" too, but that's besides the point) and writes books about every aspect of  the game.  He also has what should be one of the best books on standard  openings out there.  There seems to be no aspect of chess he hasn't  covered.  Yet maybe that's the problem: his books are chock full of typos,  diagram errors, misstatements, misattributions, and just plain  poorly-written material.  Perhaps he cranks these books out a little TOO  fast.  When I opened this book three times to random pages in the bookstore  and found huge mistakes on each page (mistakes that can be found without  even playing the games through on a chess set), what's the point of buying  the book?  He even has position diagrams where he builds up to the fact  that white is about to make this oh-so-amazing move that all students  should study carefully...and then he gives it, and either it's an  impossible move, or in the diagram white's piece is ALREADY there, so we  don't know where said piece is coming from, and thus why this move was so  unexpected.  That's just one error...it would take forever to catalog them  all and you get the idea anyway.  What's most frustrating is, as I said,  his books COULD be great.  Clearly I and many others could learn a lot from  Schiller, but he needs a proof-reader or two.  (Incidentally this review  applies to all Schiller's books I have seen so far, and not just EOCW. 
 This book is cheap. Cute, but cheap. I was expecting a board book, and the content would have been just right for one. It's paperback, with two staples in the middle. I think $...would have been a fair price, especially since I had to reiforce our copy with tape before I could let our 20-month toddler have it. She does enjoy it, and the art is cute, but I felt cheated by the poor quality 
 This book is not clearly written.  Many terms are used incorrectly or in a very questionable manner.  The answers in the back of the book for all odd-numbered "homework" problems and all test questions is very helpful and convenient.  If I were chosing a textbook, it would not be this 
 I happen to know the first man on the moon: the guy is now a janitor in a pool hall in Birmingham Alabama, in total obscurity. Why didn't the author even interview this guy? He's in on it. It never stops. 
 Disapointing. Here we have a $25 book with 120 pages, probably at least 100 of which could be eliminated. The book is wordy, vague and full of meaningless examples and ambiguous statements. Don't waste your money. 
 I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars!  Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007.  Too bad I bought it in December.  This is a piece of junk.  I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer.  (It was $12 at that time).  I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate.  I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time.  So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000?  I never knew.  The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000.  I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.  It will probably do better than this.  
 If these stories were by some unknown writer, they would have been boring and dull.  But from Jennifer Weiner, they are a real disappointment.  I can't imagine this book would have been published but for the fact that it was an automatic "sell" to Weiner fans.    I have to agree with an earlier reviewer - note to Jennifer:  Enough with the overweight underdog from a divorced family - try some new material!  You are a fantastic writer - get creative 
 Don't be scammed. Do yourself a favor and do a search of the web using "quackery" and  "Jordan Rubin". Read about the fake degrees, bogus organizations, and other surreptitious means used by these modern day flim flam artists to line their pockets. If afterward, you are not convinced that you are being scammed by these cons, then you have either not read enough or you are not being honest with yourself.  
 This is simply the worst, most inconsistent sellout album ever!  Gwen Stefani is a complete joke and she has completely lost her credibility in musicianship and all of my respect for her (which was mistakenly quite high).  I even defended her side about the break-up of No Doubt, but this is rediculous.  She is completely terrible now.  Her husband Gavin Rossdale (formerly of Bush) should completely resent his decision to be her husband except for her looks (he has $--so so what about this much more).  As for the album:  did I mention INCONSISTENT.  No two songs sound alike.  The only way you like them all is if you just love her voice, however, I do and i still hate most of them.  Good luck in the future, I hope you create some good work, this is not that.  By the way, I hate the lead single (and the second, sweet escape, though mostly an empty track, has some upside to it) 
 I am one of the few Barry Bonds fans around, so when I decided to find a book on him, I was disappointed to find that there were surprisingly few.  Noticing that "Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman" was purported to be in-depth, not just another glossy biography and had good reviews on Amazon.com, I decided to make the purchase.  Now, after reading it and piecing a few things together, I must say that I am thoroughly let-down.  A few observations:  1) The cover and title are cheesy.  I know that the book's author may not have had any say in this, but using "Baseball's Superman" as a title makes it sound like a cover story for Sports Illustrated for Kids.  2) The book is not written well.  It is very choppy and author Steven Travers has a tendency to ramble off-topic for pages on end.  3) Not that I'm some avatar of morality, but what's the deal with all the sexual references?  [...]  4) There are contradictions sprinkled throughout the book.  For instance, on page 36, Travers quotes Bonds as saying: "My father and I were never really close when I was growing up."  Then, just five pages later, he quotes Bonds as saying: "My father and I have always been very close."  Sure, Bonds is the one contradicting himself, but Travers never points this out, just one example of the multiple occasions where I almost laughed out loud at the book's inconsistencies.  5) How many times are we to hear that Travers played pro ball?  Big deal, you struck out 15 guys in a minor league game. There are minor-leaguers who have hit 60 homers, thrown perfect games, etc. and they are nobodies.  I do not mean this as a slight, just a point that we do not need to hear incessantly about things such as "Stan Javier played with me" or how you sat in Randy Johnson's recliner, or how an interview subject calls you "Trav."  The book is about Barry Bonds, not Steven Travers.  [...]  The bottom line is that Travers squandered a golden opportunity.  Rolling the dice early in 2001 that Bonds would break the home run record, getting permission to do a book, and then seeing him acutally do it is akin to hitting the lottery for a sports journalist.  Unfortunately, the finished product seems hastily thrown together, poorly edited, and foolishly out-of-bounds in many areas.  Too often we hear about sexual hijinks that have nothing to do with Bonds, and we also get Travers's opinions on a multitude of subjects that I don't care to know his thoughts on.  The fact that I'd never even heard of this book should have been enough of a red flag, but it wasn't, and therefore I got what I deserved.  This book isn't terrible, but it also is not good, and therefore I would not recommend it.  Fans of Barry Bonds should just wait until a comprehensive biography comes out on him when his playing days are over 
 How disappointed I was by this book. It contains absolutely no news. The tattoo masters in this book do not meet in any way the high standard of irezumi that I am used to. For all you buyers who really want to learn about Japanese tattoos, read the book by Richie and Buruma, very informative. For photo's who are less blurry than in this book, just check the net or invest many dollars more for a proper book. ... . This book is a nice introduction for some common knowledge about Japanese tattoo art, but does not provide any new insights or ideas 
 The pogo stick that I ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail.  I have to say though that the return was easy.  The company had UPS come to my house and pick up the product and I was given a full refund immediatly.  The item was not great...but customer service was good 
 When I read that these sheets were 300 thread count, I expected high quality.  In fact, they are seconds.  On the top sheet, a rip had been hand-repaired, and not very well.  The sheets are thin, wrinkled, and need ironing, even out of the package.  They are also very plain.  Buy something else unless you just need a cheap set for a cottage or someplace you won't use them often 
 I use to subscribe to SHAPE several years ago, and then it was packed full of great work out routines, meal plans, etc for women at all levels of fitness.     Well . . . my last few months of Shape have been a complete disappointment.  I found very few pages of good genuine fitness and healthy eating advice.  Instead, it ranks right up with Glamour in the category of magazines with the highest percentage of advertisements, nearly all of the excercise material is supposed "quick fix" fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations, and the healthy eating advise is absolutely elementary.    There is no substance in here for women like me, the average working woman who desire to live a healthy life everyday and have limited time to commit to exercise.  I want a magazine that is inspiring with a focus on living a sustained healthy lifestyle, not a joke about getting flat abs in a week with illustrations of perfectly chiseled models who obviously do not face the body challenges of average women.  I'm sorry but most women are not going to look like "her" after two weeks, or many months of Shape's 10-30 minute a day routines, but they sure lead you to beleive so.   I highly recommend "Her Sports"  it is THE magazine for women desiring to live an active, day-to-day healthy life 
 This album is all about sex and infidelity, is this all way Usher's life is about. This album contains to substance worth listening to. This album is a total waste of money. I like 8701 100 percent better 
 All too often when consumers run across an interesting movie that they have never heard of before, they make the decision to buy or rent it based on the packaging instead of writing down the name of the show and then looking up reviews for it. This approach makes consumers the playthings of unscrupulous marketers. One such company is Anchor Bay Entertainment that this summer released a 1988 flick called "The Dead Next Door" on DVD. The packaging for this DVD touted this movie as being a lost horror classic that has now resurfaced. In fact, its labelled a "Collector's Edition" and a "Making Of" documentary is added to the DVD. Such are the lengths that Anchor Bay has gone to in order to deceive uninformed customers.  The marketing claims are only partly right. The Dead Next Door really is a "lost" horror flick that has been out of sight (not even on cable television) since it was originally released in 1988. However, it is not a classic, unless you consider poorly made features to be "classics" in their own right. Think of a latter day Ed Wood type production made with even less talent than found in Ed Wood's movies.   The Dead Next Door was the brainchild of an Akron, Ohio teenager named J.R. Bookwalter who somehow persuaded Hollywood movie maker Sam Raimi to put up the financing for a flick to be shot on Super 8. In gratitude, Bookwalter named the lead role "Raimi" and one of the lesser roles "Dr. Savini" after Sam Raimi associate Tom Savini. The name of the evil cult leader is named Rev. Jones in honor of the real life Rev. Jim Jones who was responsible for the Jonestown mass suicide in 1978. How original.  The Dead Next Door is a good example of what happens when a teenager with no real movie making experience is given a miniscule budget to make a feature length flick. Abandoned houses, and a high school serve unconvincingly as high tech labs, government offices and as a headquarters for a zombie cult. The plot is completely unimaginative, the acting is just plain awful, and the original actors voices have been clumsily dubbed back in and sound completely wooden. While watching this, you will find yourself frequently looking at your watch even though the flick is only 84 minutes long.  As with the case of so many of today's Shot on Video (SoV) horror flicks, The Dead Next Door comes off looking really cheap and gives the impression of having been just thrown together over the weekend in hopes of cashing in on cool box art, an intriguing title and gullible movie fans. And with good reason since The Dead Next Door was shot in just a few days and comes across as a cheapjack production that was made in haste and with but little talent.  The Dead Next Door is a horror flick that is so bad that it is bad. In both this flick and in subsequent productions, J.R. Bookwalter shows the lack of an eye for detail and total unoriginality that has resulted in his name being mud among knowledgeable horror flick fans.  In any event, The Dead Next Door is a waste of both your time and money no matter how low a price you can  get it for 
 I did not find this book as helpful as I was hoping. First, and most importantly, I needed more examples. There was only one and it was a service organization and I needed to see an example of a manufacturing organization where the target customer was not so geographically limited. Also, I found that the way the book is organized was difficult. I felt the book was more oriented toward helping someone sort out their thoughts and feelings about starting a business than it was focused on actually structuring and writing a business plan. What I actually need are the hard, factual mechanics of writing a business plan and I did not find it to my satisfaction in this book 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 I like to read (or listen to) non-fiction- but not tedious, weighed down non-fiction.  I have recommended (and at times purchased) this book to numerous friends.  The book is enlightening, engaging and exceptional. A book to be relished (pun intended).  Regretably, I cannot say this for the author's next effort. I think Cod is one of the most fascinating, enjoyable books I have encountered.  One great book 
  Tired of all the hullaballoo surrounding Tolkien I finally purchased LOtR. I enjoy fantasy and tried to give it a fair shake but put the book down from boredom a quarter of the way through. I found myself rereading pages because my mind wasn't getting into his prose. There are better works out there, IMHO.  Everyone sings the praises of him so YOU might enjoy it, but I much prefer George Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 These guys have skills. The cd has good beats, a fresh flow, and some thoughtful lyrics. and thats the problem. its funny how these guys wonder why their music wont get played on the radio. im surprised anyones heard of these guys, and actually still make music. why dont the white people just go listen to some Screwdriver or Boots and Braces? Im white, and I dont listen to skinhead music. This is racist garbage, and if these people can only cry and blame the white man for their problems then all they're doing is giving the power to the white people. they're the ones talking like we're above them. I dont know anyone who thinks like these people say we do. Its a sad excuse to use for cover up for the fact that you cant get a job or complete school. Dead Prez areant starting a movement against anything no matter how hard they try. All this cd did was erase these guys hopes of making it big in the music scene. no airplay, no recognition, no respect. good job guys. stop crying and start thinking. you have the power to change you life, dont expect it from others to do it for you. too bad, such talent, such a pity 
 I have never been so disappointed in purchasing books that I have owned in the past as I have been with this book!!  I have probably bought about 20 copies of this book over the last 20ish years.  This used to be a wonderful book, now it is nothing but advertisements for other books about similar topics.  There is not even mention of the loss of a phone call in there.  Not only will I never purchase this book again, but I will also quit referring it to people that have loss in their lives.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! 
 I'm a big James Woods fan and came across this movie here. I have never heard of it and it is not available at any of the video stores in my area. So I ordered it because of all the positive reviews here, but wound up turning it off in the middle. It was real long, uninteresting, and was taking too long for anything to happen. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend you not buy this yet, like I did. Try checking out "Indictment" or "Dirty Pictures", two of Woods's best movies 
 WP Kinsella's book "Box Socials" is an excellent insight into the white trash of Alberta. It displays a community kind of like Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," with many well-defined social  classes in an area where you're judged by your name. However, the book  loses a plot during a Ukranian wedding, and it drudges on to the end 
 Sorry guys, but after all the hype that was building up to the initial release of the Blue Lion Collection here, I am extremely disappointed about the final product here.    OK, first of all I was a big fan of this show back in '84 and '85....but that was when I was only like 10 or so.  So, weigh that in with what I have to say below.  So 20+ years later, even after restoration, the animation in this series just doesn't hold up.  From the crudely animated environment to the pencil like drawings of the lions and Voltron, to the terribly animated mouth movements, the animation is just horrible compared to the 3D enhanced animation we get today in modern animated shows like Justice League and other mainstream anime series.  Oh, one note about the restoration itself.  If this is restored, I'd hate to see what it was like prior to restoration.  It still looks pretty bad, IMO.    Another thing I find disturbing is the juvenile dialogue.  Very childish dialogue on top of very childish voice-overs.  I mean it's not even funny.  It's like the scrounged the bottom of the barrel to get these actors to voice this show.  I guess I'm just spoiled now that modern animated show get some top voice actors to give life to the characters.  I bought this collection with the intention of buying the whole set, but after struggling to get through the 15 episodes, I'm not gonna waste any more of my time or money on this badly aged series.  If I may say so myself, the packaging is the only redeeming feature of this set.  Shame the series itself isn't any better.   Now, if they were to ever release the 3D CGI animated version of Voltron, I'd buy that set in an instant.  That one was for a much mature audience.  Hopefully it'll see the light of day soon.  IIRC, it was only 26 episodes or so, so a 4 disc set would catch that one 
 This 1958 film of Graham Greene's novel is interesting today mostly as an historical artifact. It is not a particularly outstanding example of the art of cinema, just a dated melodrama in which the location exteriors in Saigon lead to interior dialogue scenes that are stagy and leaden and obviously take place on unconvincing studio sets. It is admittedly fascinating to see some of the exact same Saigon locations that were used in the 2002 film, and Michael Redgrave does bring a weight and soul to the role of Fowler.  Sadly, however, the film brutalizes his character. Where Greene's novel was about a world-weary Brit, confronted with a blindly idealistic American willing to sacrifice innocent lives in the name of his goals, the film inverts everything. Pyle is a virtual saint and Fowler merely the gullible old man who plays a part in Pyle's downfall not out of a desire to protect the innocent, but simply to rid himself of a romantic rival. It is not difficult to see why Graham Greene was incensed by the film and disowned it.  Fascinatingly, director/screenwriter Joe Mankiewicz manages to make this total change largely by the addition of one scene at the end. His film basically follows Greene's novel, up until [SPOILER WARNING!] an atrocious final scene in which we learn that Fowler has been hoodwinked all along by the Communists, and has destroyed a noble American who was genuinely bringing freedom and hope to Indochina. A prescient warning about America's doomed involvement in Vietnam becomes a piece of jingoistic propaganda to support the war.  The 2002 film, in comparison, is amazingly faithful to the novel. I don't always hold that as the measure of a film's success, but with a master storyteller like Greene, why mess with perfection. Do not choose this film if you want accomplished filmmaking, or an accurate interpretation of Graham Greene's intentions, for that pick up Phillip Noyce's 2002 film. Watch this only afterwards, to see how a few small changes can undermine an entire narrative. 
 I thought this book would offer more in the way to make changes in your home, instead it is a nice narrative of people who have been helped by the author.  I prefer a direct "how to" approach, and this was not it - very disappointing.  Gregory Bodenhammer has two books on this topic that are more direct, concise and to the point.  I found that "Back in Control" and "Parent in Control" had a lot of useable information 
 Just STOP listening to music altogether. PLEASE, PLEASE JUST STOP SMOKING HIS POLE AS WELL, ITS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN YOUR REVIEW.  To everyone else, listen to all of Eminem's albums before this one. Actually you probably have unless you live in a bubble.  That is all 
 I was quite disappointed by this book - its like a 19th century history with a shallow retelling of the names of Sultans, dates and major battles. I would have expected a greater analysis of the socio-cultural milieu in which the Ottoman empire arose and the institutions it spawned. I kept reading on hoping that this would follow but its really just a chronological listing of sultans, the major battles fought - if you want a political history of the empire, this may work for you. But when, why not just read the Wikipedia entry if you have no interest in the socio-political institutions.   
 This might be touted by many as a "wonderful spiritual classic,"  but if you are a Christian, I'd stay away from this one.  It is gnostic to the core.  I bought it hoping to learn about Catholic hermaneutics - what a dumb mistake.  That's what the teaching magisterium of the Catholic Church is for!  Stick to documents of Vatican II and you won't get lost.  Plus, they are just as exciting and an easier read than this heady book of 'secrets'!    Not everything with a Catholic label is authenitcally Catholic: Found these comments about a couple of the books endorsers on another website:  "The similarities between centering prayer and Transcendental Meditation are striking. "As an ex-TM mediator," says Fr. Finbarr Flanagan, O.F.M., "I find it hard to see any differences between centering prayer and Transcendental Meditation." Frs. Keating, Menninger, and Pennington authored centering prayer at a time when St. Joseph Abbey had received several retreats involving Eastern religions, including Transcendental Meditation. I cited Fr. Pennington's praise for the Hindu guru and author of Transcendental Meditation. This involvement in eclecticism has continued. Fr. Pennington has not just attended an e.s.t (Erhard Sensitivity Training) session but has served on its board. Frs. Keating and Pennington gave endorsements, appearing on the dust jacket, for Meditations on the Tarot: A Journey in Christian Hermeticism. The tarot is a deck of cards used in fortune telling. Fr. Keating calls the book "the greatest contribution to date toward the rediscovery and renewal of the Christian contemplative tradition." Fr. Pennington says it is "without doubt the most extraordinary work I have ever read." Amity House, the publisher, is heavily New Age. The Library of Congress has classified the book under "occult sciences" and "cartomancy."  'Nuff said 
 I am a long-time Austen fan-though not one of Stephanie Barron, whose footnotes I find endlessly annoying.  I found myself wanting to throw this novel away halfway through, when Hatty was being falsely accused of all that nonsense. Blah, blah, blah. I decided to persevere, and found it interesting, though as others remark, too, too Dickensian. But that ending!!!  WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?  What a let-down!  Ending up with Godwit? Pullease!  It certainly made Camber look even more an idealistic fool than before.  And that letter with the reference to Hatty dying young--why even include that?  We all would rather just have her drift away as part of that time period without being forced to contemplate mortality.  And why  that letter from the present anyway?  Takes away all the 18th Century, pre-Regency atmosphere.  Unnecessary and stoopid 
 If you are a new writer; never published and find that you are somewhat lacking in the area of Erotic Romance, I do not recommend this book as a guide that will enable you to write your erotic love scenes effectively, thus pulling your readers in; as well as heighten the excitement and anticipation of your lovers in print; in other words "brain sex," whether explicit or done in a way so as not to be crude as your story unfolds.  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Erotic Romance is full of opinions that lack depth, as well as workable simple formulas by both the author and other published authors whose comments appear in the back of the book (some who are best selling authors). I found the publication to be of no help at all.  Good examples and a guide for structure and/or tension building is what I expected to get from reading the reviews that sold me on the book. In regard to drafting your erotic love scenes, acquiring a method of tension building among the lovers that is required to gain and maintain your readers interest how-to was severely lacking.  In closing....if you need serious help in this area....please look elsewhere for information that will help you to enhance your characters in the bedroom, as well as outside of it as they travel along the lovers erotic adventure you have chosen to write.

 Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read. 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Had the professor who wrote the book.  the book is just as  haughty and arrogant. what a waste of time the whole situation is... 
 Too many pretty pictures and not enough information to really understand the essence of San Francisco. I didn't think this book was worth the money 
 Here is the thing.  I am a huge fan of Suze's books - especially the Young, Fab and Broke book because it really answered questions that I really needed to ask.  From her books and her website, I've realized how important it is to have a living trust set up and as I do not have the budget to get myself an attorney, I thought this product would be ideal for me.  Well, despite all the bad reviews, I figured Suze Orman would stand by her product and get the on-line updates that might fix any problems previous mentioned by other reviewers.  I waited anxiouly for the product to arrive and after 1 full week of waiting I finally received it and attempted to install it. As the program finished installing - it asked if I'd like to down load the update and I clicked yes.  Well, what I got was a very pretty frame with blank contents.  Oh, somthing must have gone wrong.... I reinstalled and same result.  I reinstalled again and this time didn't download the update.  Same result.    I contacted the customer service via Suze's website - and did not receive any acknolwegement or response for 5 business days.  I e-mailed them again with scathing remarks - after which they responded with a case number and asked for my mailing address to send a replacment disk.  It has been two weeks since I sent them my address and I have yet to recieve it.    Product is the most important, but customer service is just as important if not more so.  If Suze can't hire the people to help her create a product she can stand by - then she needs to at least hire great customer support so that her fans don't turn into unsatisfied customers.  I resisted writing a bad review because I really wanted to use the product and have good things to say about it.  Again, I was a great fan of Suze Orman.  I really believed in Suze's integrity and name.  Now I'm so disappointed and outraged at her customer service, I want to warn all you future buyers out there.  Don't buy it - or at least untill the company can stand by its product and can provide prompt customer service. It has been nearly 1 full month since I have ordered the product and I have yet to use it.  I would have given it "0" stars if that had been an available option 
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 I should let you know that I have heard all of Badly Drawn Boy's early EPs and I own all of his studio albums. I consider him one of my favorite musicians. That is why I am incredibly disappointed with Badly Drawn Boy's latest full-length, Born In The UK. This is just an appallingly awful CD. Having thoroughly enjoyed all of Badly Drawn Boy's previous work, I never would have imagined him capable of a CD this bad. I'm shocked and disappointed.   I don't know what happened to Badly Drawn Boy. I personally think his best album was the soundtrack to About A Boy. Have You Fed The Fish and One Plus One were enjoyable, but I started to get the feeling he was treading water a bit. Well, with Born In The UK, Badly Drawn Boy has given up trying to stay afloat. Damon Gough has completely lost all of his talent for writing lyrics. Born In The UK features some of the tritest, cliched, cringe-inducing MOR lyrics since James Blunt was dumped upon the listening public. It's just embarrassing.   If you are a big Badly Drawn Boy fan, you'll probably be offended by this review and want to own the CD regardless of its inferior quality. Have fun with it. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. If, however, you have a limited amount of money to spend on music, I would thoroughly encourage you to spend your money on a better release. 
 This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in "black face" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL 
 I usually like the Emanuel outlines and have found them invaluable now for eight other courses I've taken.  The Taxation outline is an exception.  I forced myself through the first five chapters in this book and then gave up on it, realizing that it was not adding to my general understanding of the course material or any of the little details either, for that matter.  It was too hard to read and follow to be of help.  
 All these reviews are right on the MONEY!! IT GETS TOOOO HOT!! I bought this crock-pot to replace my old Rival crock-pot that is the same size because I liked the idea of the timer and keep-warm setting. I have used it 3 times and it has over cooked all three meals! I put a beef stew in it today on LOW at 9:00AM and by noon the potatoes were mushy and falling apart and it was BOILING, I hate to think what it would have been like if I let it cook for the recommended 8 - 10 hours! GOOD THING I WAS HOME TODAY! I had also bought my daughter one for Christmas, because of her busy schedule sometimes she does not get home in time to turn her crock-pot off and thought the KEEP WARM setting would be GREAT for her. But I just called her and she told me she tried cooking a roast in it this week and it come out burnt and she only cooked it on LOW for six hours!! I rated this one star because the website would not let me rate it ZERO 
 Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know.   Alterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party.   Every election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage.   Alterman tells us that "when it bleeds, it leads". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on.   
 This book is definitely written by someone who knows JSF.  From the author's point of view, the structure and style of this book may have made sense.  From your point of view as a reader, unfortunately, it does not.  The code examples are broken unnaturely and even an experienced developer will find themselves wondering what class this or that code fragment belongs to.  There's no solid narrative that shows you how to accomplish the objective of building a component.  Instead, there is a confounding play-by-play: do this, then this, then this...  Its a memorization challenge.  Complexity is not really an excuse to jettison any attempt to make a book readable.  That is the books main flaw, it takes an admittedly challenging subject (JSF and AJAX integration) and makes it almost impossibly uncohesive and, frankly, dull.  Another disturbing fact is that AJAX plays a remarkably small role in the book.  So much so that it walks the line of simply cashing in on the hype by putting the name on the cover.  Having found these things to be true, I decided if I downloaded the source code and used that as a framework for understanding, the book might be more useful.  I surfed on over to its website only to discover - THERE IS NO SOURCE CODE.  That's just plain scary.  The book graduates from 1 to 2 stars based on the fact that there is a lot of information present, expecially regarding the processing lifecylce.  You won't have much fun parsing it though.  When I saw this book, I thought, "Great!  This is EXACTLY what I'm looking for."  Don't fall into the trap.  The title is exactly what you are looking for, not the book. 
 I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine. While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods. I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it. Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms. I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self. When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience. This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream. Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them. This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them 
 Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok.  And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  Then I finished the book and I realized something.  Nothing had happened really.  There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  I don't really understand why so many people love this book.  This book is average at best and not much else.      
 Nothing in this book would be inappropriate for a 6-year-old to see. All the pictures were in black and white and NONE of them were gory. This book is just recycled stories we've all heard about dead celebs with a portrait of them included. It should be called "My First Mystery Book". Very disappointing 
 Wow..What lies.  I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.  The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.  Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.  Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.  Give me a break.  This book is 100% lies.  I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).  Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is grea 
 First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.   I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face. 
 Looks really good on the shelf but it's all show.  If you like/need modular, the connections are convenient, but the cables are low quality.  I purchased a much better unit manufactured by HIPER, the connectors and cables are much better.  If you don't need modular, Coolermaster is also much better quality.  I'm not just splitting hairs here, this unit does not compare to others in the same price range 
 Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person.  
 As has already been mentioned --- the author makes numerous assumptions, but offers no proof, because he apparently feels that facts and figures are not required in a holocaust book. Mr. Dean should not set himself above truthful and honest approach to a touchy subject 
  From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read. 
 This mans theories have been taken too far. Sure he wrote the book well but the content is laughable. In order to prove the theory proposed, he requires future findings of fossils that, to this day, haven't been found yet. 1/5 Stars for Charlie 
 I read this book while I was pregnant and referenced it after, and though it built up my confidence before I breast fed, it underminded it afterword.  It gives very little advice about those mom's who have major trouble (beyond typical latch on problems) and children who have medical issues that require them to have some formula. The authors persuasive yet one-sided approach made me suspicious of my doctors motives reguarding supplemetation of formula for my child for medical reasons( which thankfully I listened to the doctor in the end). It also gives little help or support to moms going back to work or those who want to be descreate about breast feeding, and does a very good job making you feel guity about any choices that may be contradictory to the authors feelings.  The author is also big on using antidotes, rather then evidence, to support her views.  However,this book does a good job in touting the benefits of breast feeding and giving you lots of information why breast milk is best, but this is information you can obtain in most breastfeedin books. I have been sucessfully nursing now for several months, and I feel that this book did very little to contribute to that. Nursing mothers need good information and support, not propaganda.  Save your money and buy the Dr. Sears book 
 Wow, if you have read previous ten reviews you'll think that Mr. Pancake was the embodiment of Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and Malmud. It is truly unfortunate that he killed himself in 1979. If he had lived, today he might be one of America's great short story writers. His writing style is measured and sparse. It is as if he had not looked to expand his writer's pallet of possibilities.   Pancake's is a story worth knowing for its sense of profound loss not its sense of contribution. His stories of West Virginia draw you in and leave you with a satisfaction of understanding the protagonists and their situations. But, there are no deep messages. The deep messages were still in the heart and brain that were stopped by a self inflected shotgun blast. Cry for the loss. There is not a volume of work to celebrate 
 I purchased Crazy Croc even after reading all the bad reviews, but my son really wanted it so I bought it for him for Christmas anyway.  It was the worst gift i've ever bought....please don't even waste your money....trust me, check the reviews first, now that's worth it... 
 This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss 
 I have been a member of 12-Step programs for 20 years. I have been in therapy for 32 years (originally mandated by the court in 1969). I have written a book about addiction myself. People who are mandated to go to 12-Step programs by the courts do not have to stay once their obligation is fulfilled. People who do stay get help. For me the combination of 12-Step programs, therapy and religion has brought me the recovery from addiction that I prayed for before I even knew what praying really meant. Stanton Peele's book is reactionary and uses fear tactics to sell books and inflate the author's ego. I am sad that he chooses to attack programs that have such a wonderful track record. Psychology has been helpful to me over the years, but 12-Step programs (the people, the principles, the literature, and the meetings) have saved my life 
 When reading the author's mention of driving to synagogue on Shabbat, or cooking on Friday Nights, a voice at the back of my mind told me that such a thing (breaking the Sabbath) would have been abhorrent to my ancestors and 4,000 years of Jewish tradition. Although the author's Judaism fits very well in the context of contemporary American society, for those of us interested in the Religion of our Forefathers.  Readers on a true spiritual search or those looking for something more authentic might be interested in Buber's "Tales of the Hasidim" or Heschel's "An Island in Time". Though less 'modern', they impart more meaning and relevance 
 I was so excited to buy this video for my 3 year old daughter, as she is absolutely fascinated with My Little Pony toys, books, etc. What I never expected were the comments she made while watching it. I certainly never expected that I needed to review it for content before putting it in. When your daughter keeps saying, "They are being really rude and mean, mommy... we should take it out..." I knew I had a problem. The video actually scared her, as the movie is a FAR stretch from the innocence and sweetness of the other My Little Pony products. I absolutely would NOT recommend this for other children. If you do buy it... I recommend you watching it BEFORE letting your child watch it. 
 I feel happy that tv series that I watched many years ago .  Now I can get them in DVD, but these serios were no popular just in USA in other countries of Latin America was popular too.  It should be make in Spanish too or with subtitles in several languages.  Thank 
 This book has nice pictures and some helpful information. However take it from someone who has purchased to many "how to build a deck" books.  If you are actually going to build your deck, and if it is anything other than a basic 1 level deck out the back, if you want to do some really nice finish work, there is only one book I have found that even comes close to telling you how to do it and the tips and tricks.  If you are serious save your money and buy Building a Deck: Expert Advice from Start to Finish.  It is the only good book on building.  You will be glad you did. 
 I am new to sewing and working to set up sewing area. I thought this would be a guideline book. What it seems to be is the personal sewing rooms of professionals. If I were a publisher of sewing books, I too could have these sewing rooms.  I think they have beautiful places to develop their patterns and books they sell to us. I wish they had considered someone who doesn't have the funds to set up these places. The closest they came to my life style was the one under the stairs.  Unfortunately, I don't have any stairs. Perhaps they should have gone back to when they did not have a publishing company and think about the closets being used for clothes, not sewing rooms. I will figure out a place to sew, but not with much help from this book. 
 Here, in all their glory, is REM: the undisputed Pied Pipers of the bedwetters.  While Michael Stipe's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a German Stuka dive-bomber, the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere.  In REM, we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying.  The embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992, but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate.  This album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift 
 While Giroux asks a few good questions, I can't take seriously the suggestion that Disney animations are sexist, racist, or anti-democratic. Space limitations prevent a full rebuttal, but if Giroux went after Santa Claus, I bet he'd be a gluttonous, chain-smoking, reindeer abusing, elf oppressing, break-and-enter man with an unnatural fixation on young children. If you want to read how he does a job like this on "The Lion King" and other great movies, this is the book for you 
 Just as some may confuse an amature photograph with an artful one simply because its in black and white, New Found Glory have confused "mature" music with sad, crybaby songs. They seem to have Jim Carrey's disease. Too bad 
 To build up a thesis and a book title on Edison like this is uninformed and dishonoring to Edison. Edison was no 'mere' inventor, but a much more broad thinker and leader of non-violence. It is a misnomer to think of an 'Edison gene' that makes people good hunters. Edison was committed to non-violence and NOT hunting. This book regards ADHD, a quality that, in an ancient, dangerous, changing world, may indeed have been to some benefit. But Edison was no hunter.  Thomas Edison wrote that, "Non-violence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages."  Edison, a true thinker, rejected the violence of hunting and killing, and was a committed vegetarian. 
  This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after.    I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.   I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention.                                                                                                                             
 'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.  Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.  Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first 
 I gave it two stars because while I didn't hate it, it was dull and predictable.  I see beter plots on TV's Starsky and Hutch.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to use subtitles; I found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie.  I know, that's only my opinion, but I watch a lot of DVD's and I think I know what I like and don't like 
 I work in NYC and live on Long Island and the watch would never connect. The whole point of th watch was that it did that, but it never did. I returned right away 
 Milton deserves better than this.  Orgel and Goldberg boast that they have produced a radical Milton, but all they really offer is rehashed Alastair Fowler, without Fowler's erudition or eloquence.  Many of the notes are  just plain ignorant.  There are better editions out there 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 The cast of mostly fine actors (Cuba Gooding, Jr., James Woods, Anne Archer) must have been echoing CBJ's classic line from his Oscar-winning role in "Jerry Maguire" when they agreed to appear in this wretched misfire.  When the President is assasinated, the agent in charge of his safety (Gooding) and a maverick reporter (Angie Harmon) go on the trail of the conspiracy behind the crime.  The dull investigation requires all the deductive expertise of a child's connect-the-dots puzzle, existing merely as a skeleton upon which to hang the various action scemes, some of which are quite good.  Not good enough, however, to rescue this amateurish attempt at a screenplay.  End review 
 I am a seasoned Java developer, but not an experienced Web developer and I bought this book because I wanted to bring myself up to speed on Web development using Spring; but I am sobered now. The book was obviously quickly pieced together from disparate material. Nobody seemed to have worked the examples through before releasing the book; these examples are inconsistent, and I lost a lot of time debugging and searching for the reasons why it did not work. E.g. on page 62 there is a diagram of what you should get when you follow the instructions; but if you follow the instructions, you do not get it. (resp. it makes assumtions about what is availble in the Web server without telling so). If you are an experienced Web developer, you can probably make up the missing parts by yourself; if you are not, you spend a lot of effort searching for missing parts of the puzzle, instead of learning the thing you wanted. Its a pitty the autors or editors did not spend the time in order to tediously check the content and make it consistent throughout; I think it could be a good instructional book (despite containing too much vain praise like ".. are highly configurable and extensible ..." instead of hard facts (e.g. useful examples of extensions); so it is only a text book for those already knowledgeable 
 I don't usally buy Buffy YA titles, I just stick to the adult ones. But I read the back cover and desided to take a gamble. And it reenforced my promise never to read Buffy YA books. Scott Ciencin spends way too much time on his own chacters, and on Dawn and Buffy, that there zero cacterzaion for anyone else, ie Willow or Xander for exsample. To the point of all the story really needed was the man's own chacters, and Buffy and Dawn. Everyone else plays such a small role I don't know why Scott put them in there at all. It was so bad I couldn't even finsh the book... 
 This is just a big, fat, pretentious bunch of bits and pieces. There are only 3 "hummable" songs on it, and I already have two. Brian Wilson is/was a master, no doubt. But this is not a good example. I'll take the recording Holland (my favorite) anytime. The Beach Boys sum is definitely better than the sum of any of its parts. Too bad they can't get back together 
 If I could have given this a ZERO rating, I would have.  I bought these sheets because they were "deep pocket" sheets.  They have shrunk and no longer fit my bed 
 It is reasonably accurate. The numbers displayed are formed irregularly. You can't zero it out by zeroing one category i.e. Distance. The price is reflective of its quality 
 Trying out a moderate position that lets him have his conservative genius  Shakespeare in quotes and so eat it too, Bate has written a lifeless,  boring account of Shakespeare.  The prose is wooden.  The book is so  tedious I confess I didn't get through much of it 
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 From reading the other reviews on Amazon, it seems you either love or hate this novel.   I'm falling on the disappointed side.  I was hoping for a novel similar to what W. Somerset Maugham would write.  Instead, this novel turned out to be painfully  s-l-o-w and boring.  After reading half the novel, I couldn't take it anymore.  I had to bail out.   I can't remember the last time that I quit a novel because it was so unreadable.   It's apparant that Alan Furst is no W. Somerset Maugham.       
 all covers.  I know it's heresy to speak ill of such a awesome group of guys, but I am not a fan of cover material.  Spend a little creative effort on the song-writing side, vice the performance aspect.  We need new material from you guys, not more re-hashing of other people's songs.  Michael Schenker, Pat Travers, & Frank Marino must have covered every rock/blues song out there.  Press forward with original songs, so that in 10-15 years, the next generation can cover them 
 I have to read this text book for one of my 3rd year Computer Science course.  My professor picked the worst book there is for us to learn.  The exam is open book but I can't use any of the stuff that's written in this piece of sh*t.  Whever wrote this book should jump off the building and die.  It tried to include too many topic at once and fail to explain how to used each of them.  All it does is throw you examples of the stuff they wrote.  Firstly, their examples don't work. Secondly, that is not now most programmer will approach it.  It tries to teach connection with a database but did not provide any PreparedStatement or Statement and did not provide text on DriverManger.getConnection.  How the hell do we connect then??  Bottom line is this book sucks!!  EJB, Servlets, Jsp, JMS, JNDI, XML, JDBC, JavaMail my A**!! 
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 Weak. There's not even any incest in it, not that that's a BAD thing, but c'mon - read the title. Is this a marketing ploy?? HELLO!! A simple illustrated read for adults, I was compelled to pull it off the shelf and then finished it in a few minutes ... but I found it floppy; only mildly interesting, and the illustrations, while nifty, were, well, nifty. Bummer, as well, to see another story where the girls are cruel to one another 
 I have no idea whether Morehouse's story is true, or completely made up, but I will say it reads like the latter. I don't believe in conpiracy theories in general not because I don't believe a government would do something bad, but that they could successfully cover it up. It's against all human nature not to talk, especially about something big, so I don't believe secrets are easy to keep nowadays. That said, Morehouse's book reads like badly-written, paranoid "sci-fi"...not a well-written book, neither believable nor entertaining 
 I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time.  It was just that bad.  I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it.  It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel.  It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry.  I almost feel dumber for having read this.  Is this really what women RELATE to?  If so, that is so sad?  I found every character in this book just sad.  Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love.  C'mon!  Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown.  F 
 Thomas's work is one of magnificent writing. His pen traces the details of cells with accuracy only surpassed by an electron microscope. Unfortunately, his precision with words and insightful description does not censure criticism of his conclusions. Largely liberal and at times extremely ethereal, Thomas's inferences from observations into society at large and human behavior are largely unfounded or simply appear as ranting. While other writers may be guilty of the same transgression, Thomas couches his commentary behind the mask of biology and below the reader's scanning objective on their microscope of reading. At a glance, Lewis Thomas weaves a wonderous fusion of biology and artistic literature, but the merit of The Lives of a Cell ends at this superficial level of reading. An excellent work of biology and literature, but a work lacking in logical conclusions, The Lives of a Cell provides an excellent introduction to interesting biological facts and theories, but falls short of endowing the reader with much in the way of critical insight into the portent of his descriptions and when he attempts to do so, errs in favor of sophistry 
 Unless you're next in line for the job at USC or Texas or LSU, then this book doesn't apply to you. And if you are in line for those jobs, you're in a world of hurt if need to read this book to help you coach. This book is totally useless to the masses who are looking to help coach their sons or daughters baseball teams. The advice given doesn't apply to 95% of the people who are looking to improve their knowledge of coaching baseball. Keep looking for a better book 
 In this book, the author tries to encourage Americans to forget the Declaration of Independence because even though a plurality of men have rights, the rights of individuals have never been identified.  So, the author becomes a member of Marilyn Ferguson's Aquarian Conspiracy and the New Age movement, which place individuals above `the people' of the USA and its Union.  On p. 277, the author says that the truth or falsities of the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is a meaningless question.  While the author's conclusions can be challenged, his book has been out-dated by advanced knowledge.  First, his writing is out-dated by the 1920 discovery that' all empirical data are symbolic.' Thus, one must ask, 'How can the meaning of the Declaration of Independence become a meaningless when the Declaration is formed out of symbols that must be given meaning in order to interpret it correctly?  Second, modern science has recently led to the scientific proof of God's existence.  How can man have no natural rights if God exists?  If the author's succeeding generations are accepting this book, the USA is in deep trouble. 
 The exam changed may-june 2006,  as a well focused book it is now out of focus.  A more general book over SBS,  like  SBS 2003 Unleashed is more helpfull, although not enough concerning Exchange and some aspects of Windows 2003 
 Nancy Appleton has clearly declared her personal agenda against sugar, but her lack of objectivity, organization, credibility, or substance leave much to be desired in this book.  I was frustrated by the constant repetition throughout the text, and I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time to find any new information.  In addition, I was hoping to find concrete, applicable suggestions on HOW to kick the sugar habit.  While Dr. Appleton does attempt to include "food plans," they are simply lists of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I do NOT recommend this book to others 
 When this product came, it says "girls" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or "girls" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back 
 Pipes' utter and complete disprespect of the russian people in general and communists in particular oozes out of every paragraph of this book. According to him, nothing, absolutely nothing good ever came out of the soviet union. Every action taken by the communist party was a complete failure. Communism turned the entire russian people into alcoholic slackers incapable of accomplishing anything. I can see exactly where President Reagan got his russophobia from. Don't waste your time with this book. To quote the Sting song, "...the russians love their children, too." But you wouldn't know it from this book 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 My 3 year old spent a total of 7 minutes playing with this book before she asked to put a different book into her Leap Pad.  When I encourage her to use Pooh again, she absolutely refuses.  She loves her Pooh characters and loves her Leap Pad.  But this book?  It's never been touched again.  It seems to simple, and 3 year olds need a challenge 
 Ordered this item on Sept 28. They were supposed to ship it within 1 week. After 1 week I received an email, they said they needed 2 more weeks. Another email today (Nov 7), they think they can deliver it by November 27. That's 2 months after I placed my order. At this point, I am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year. Fortunately with Amazon, they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order, which is what I am going to do right now 
 My daughter is a senior in college. I thought this would be a cute gift. I was wrong. It is a poorly written book with no useful advice 
 THIS TOY DIDN'T EVEN LAST 3 MINUTES.  HE HAD THE STUFFING OUT IN 10 SECONDS FLAT 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 This book does not show any good resumes at all.Wasting my time and mone 
 I've read a few books by Margaret Starbird to see what evidence has been gathered to support some of the more far-fetched theories surrounding Mary Magdalene. I was disappointed to see that each outrageous claim that she made was poorly supported and neither proved nor implied anything factual. While I am a complete advocate of new interpretations of this biblical figure, I feel that Starbird has made a mockery of serious Historians who have done an amazing job revealing her true identity. If you are intending on doing any academic work on this subject, I reccomend that you start with a book by Susan Haskins or Karen King 
 I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The "graffiti" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again 
 We selected this book for our discussion group this month.  And I started reading it several days ago.  The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting.  The second half picked up with some tension and interest.  And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings.  I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story.  And the storyline followed the game 
 I got this from Dell with my laptop. For some reason Dell doesn't make their docking station anymore, so they just gave me this without telling me the brand and the model number.  I installed it with no problem, but then the video through its USB is so extremly slow. You will see about half second delay more your mouse pointer. Then while I tried connecting a serial port on the docking station, it couldn't transfer the data.  I tried installing a USB to parrelle port printer cable on the computer, some how the Targus drivers made my usb printing disable. It doesn't display any error messages at all. I had to test the cable on another Dell laptop to find out it was the docking station's proble 
 Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.  Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career 
 Whether you're planning to read through Crowley's Book of Thoth for the first time, or if you think you know every little thing Crowley was getting at with it, this book is going to be equally useless to you. Several of Crowley's diagrams from the Book of Thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly, but sadly that's the only good thing about this book.   The book is filled with a lot of fluff. Duquette tells many useless anecdotes of Crowley's and Harris' lives, and constantly excuses and defends Crowley's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper. Duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found Crowley's works, so perhaps its some sort of atonement. But the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with Crowley's character.  Through out the Book of Thoth Crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems. Having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid. Unfortunately Duquette doesn't do this. His background information is base and scarce. He does spend some time explaining about Thelema and Kabbalah, but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this, Duquette doesn't give nearly enough information to understand Crowley's works, and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere.  As for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on Crowley's work, Duquette outright fails. At times it seems as if Duquette doesn't even understand Crowley or the Book of Thoth and the associated tarot deck. I don't think the man even understands tarot in general (and Duquette's own tarot deck is evidence of this too). At his best, Duquette only manages to rephrase what Crowley had to say in the book of Thoth. Typically though a lot of what Crowley was getting at is complete lost in Duquette's work, a lot of it no doubt because Duquette never really understood Crowley at anything but a very base level.  Reading through the Book of Thoth, there are a few ways in which Duquette could have made his book better. Crowley's phonetic translation of the I Ching doesn't follow the current standard, and sometimes the differences are confusing, especially if the reader is not already familiar with the I Ching. A key showing Crowley's translation and the standard translation would've been helpful. Likewise Crowley rarely wrote on astrology, despite astrology being alluded to many times through the Book of Thoth, and what he did write is hard to find. A chapter explaining Crowley's views on astrology would've been great. If that wasn't possible, then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what Crowley was working with would have been helpful. However Duquette's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read.  Duquette's book isn't useful as a reference to Crowley's work. Duquette doesn't seem to understand Crowley most of the time, and fails to adequatley explain Crowley's ideas. Besides some new-agey nonsense, like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays, Duquette doesn't offer any new ideas or insights into Crowley's work. Except for a few nice diagrams (which are common enough and easy to find), there isn't anything worthwhile contained in this book. At least not anything you won't get out of reading Crowley's Book of Thoth 
 Joseph Ellis is a learned, competent Revolutionary era historian. While this book is a fine introduction to Washington's role in the Revolutionary War era and beyond, it doesn't approach the caliber of David McCullough's John Adams or Edmund Morris' The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography. He doesn't seem to understand Washington - he doesn't get us into his head, relying instead on historical narrative. Ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of Washington's character. Admittedly, part of the problem of interpreting Washington is that Washington manipulated his public image, acutely aware that it would endure to all generations. The Great W. was scrupulous about his private life. But rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding, Ellis attempts to paper it over. His prose style, attempting conversation, yet creaks with scholarly habit. I bought this book, relying on the stellar recommendations here on Amazon, but it seems I must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader 
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen 
 First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.  This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:            Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.    Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out 
 Don't waste your time or money.  What she wrote in the First Theme Gardens is enough.  If you can't find the first one then this is a good book, but as a REVISED and UPDATED Edition the changes were very subtle 
 Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever.. 
 Having read Frank's "What's the matter with Kansas?"---which I quite liked---I started this book.  I looked forward to reading a critique of the "Emperor's New Economic Paradigm": that the almighty *Free Market* is the answer to all of America's problems.   However, after struggling to stay awake through the first 50 pages, I cried "uncle".  Frank is not content to make a point but must go on to remake it again and again ad nauseum.  And to add injury to insult, the book's tiny, thin-line font is rather hard on the eyes even with my normal reading glasses 
 I looked forward to this book after reading the blurb here on Amazon. I started to read about the woman running from mysterious bad guys through the middle of nowhere. The creature that attacks her and the beautiful wolf,whom we later learn is a gorgeous fallen man/"shadowman", who saves her and then awakens damned and nude on her car... and then the plot was done. I mean it really went nowhere!  There is little to no character developement. Non-existant plot developement. A few secondary characters are thrown in with promise but are left vague and unentrancing. You never have a solid interest in seeing the couple get together. And the authors attempt at suspense is the shocking revelation that the bad guys name is actually satanic spelled backwards. I'm serious! LAME! If your new to this genre please don't start with this book 
 I had heard good things about this magazine and so ordered a sample.  It is a lovely magazine, beautiful photos and it is interesting reading about "other coasts" (besides east and west).  But, at least with the most recent issue, in every article about families or couples and their coastal homes the people were all caucasian.  Even the advertisements had only white people (save for one about vacationing in Mexico that had some cute Mexican children in it).  While I doubt this is intentional, I would encourage the publishers of this magazine to put their attention on this issue.  There are plenty of people of color living on the coast who have interesting homes and lives that readers would enjoy learning about 
 Richard Dawkins is a world-class evolutionary biologist and one of the best popular science writers working today.  His "The Blind Watchmaker" is, I think, the best layman's book on natural selection ever written; I re-read it every few years just to enjoy the clarity of his style.  "A Devil's Chaplain," then, is a book I really wanted to like.  I understood walking out of the bookstore that "Chaplain" would not, in the main, be about evolutionary biology.  And I have seen enough examples of scientists -- brilliant within their own areas of expertise -- who write commonplaces or even twaddle when off their home turf.  That caution did not prepare me for the spectacle of Dawkins's plunge into unselfconscious dogmatism and graceless bile in large sections of this book.  Portions of "A Devil's Chaplain" dealing with evolutionary biology are quite good.  Sections dealing with "memes" are less satisfactory.  I actually finished Dawkins's first essay on memes _less_ convinced that they are a viable analog to genes than when I went in.  In particular, Dawkins's  postlog on why science is not a meme was unconvincing, weak argumentation at best, hand-waving at worst.  Dawkins's opinions on social institutions and politics recall William F. Buckley's  quip that it would be preferable to be ruled by citizens drawn randomly from the Boston telephone book than by the members of Harvard's faculty.  Dawkins's disparagement of the concept of trial by jury (in favor of `more rational' trial by judge) misses the point of that institution in a particularly elephantine way.  His viewpoint is elitist in a distinctively cozy, English, university-don manner.  Dawkins seems so nauseated at the thought that some gaggle of dimwitted proles might sit in judgement of _him_ that he is oblivious to the notion that an individual judge -- albeit a credentialed professional and Dr. D's intellectual equal (more or less) -- might treat him unfairly.  And some of the notions Dawkins advances are just loopy.  For instance, at one point he imagines being in the presence of a genetically-engineered approximation of an australopithecene and "tearfully taking her hand in mine" -- as if the hominid in question were an actual australopithecene, not a laboratory-made chimera, and as if the poor creature were capable of understanding his emotion, let alone reciprocating it.  "A Devil's Chaplain" is an instant classic, but not of any sort that Richard Dawkins could have intended.  With it, he joins the list of brilliant specialists who missed their opportunity to leave intact the assumption that they were sages in a broad way, instead of solely in their fields of specialization 
 This book is just like watching the evening news you get lots of jingoism, and little in the way of factual documentation. Barkun's chapter on Black Helicopters for instance takes the most extreme views such as linking cattle mutilations to black helicopters and does nothing to address the topic of UN Military units operating domestically within the USA. Black Helicopters operating out of Fort Hood Texas are real, yet Barkun never bothers to tell his readers that Black Helicopters operated by the UN are real, and have even been involved in law enforcement activities here in the US. Shame on Mr. Barkun for his highly distorted take on historical events and people such as the Rockerfellers, the Council on Foreign Relations (which publically states they wish to destroy the US Constitutional Government and replace it with a UN Style world Government). If you want the truth listen to Alex Jones.. 
 But if anyone asked me what these stories were about I would not be able to tell them. I remember the titles and some of the details but not the stories. Way over my head. And I am a pretty well-read person so it's not that I'm just not a reader. I wouldn't recommend this really highly because her novels are so much better. Try The King's General, The House on the Strand 
 What a scam.  While some of the principles in this book are based on truth, it is scandalous that a doctor would abuse his role in order to make a profit. Most of the strategies he claims will give miraculous results are truly just a waste of money with a tiny grain of truth at the center.  While it's true one should get enough vitamins (centrum will do just fine) and use good products to care for skin (drugstore ones are generally just as effective, and in this case more-so), using his products & strategies can only help you by convincing you to do what you already know you should - keep your face & body clean & healthy.  His brand line is a waste of money & does not even reach the status of "ordinary" 
 While the book covers some interesting aspects of mid and high model rocketry, it is not as comprehensive as other books and dated given the advances in the hobby of the past years.  If you are looking for a book to complement your model rocketry library, this will be a useful addition.  If you are looking to take the step from basic model rocketry into mid or high power model rocketry, there are other books that better describe "how to".  
 I loved Operation Ivy immensly so I was so disappointed by how lame Rancid is. This album is pretty lame and its one of their best. After hearing Tim sing on this album I realized why they needed Jesse as lead singer in Op Iv. Now Tim is in that horrible "Transplant" band with the lame Blink 182 guy. Not to mention he's friends with that loser from GOOD CHARLOTTE!!! And the new Rancid music is sooooooo poesur. Ugggggghhhh. Although some of these songs are catchy they are all non-political and non-offensive. A lame excuse for punk rock, I probably would have liked Rancid back when I used to listen to Green Day. 
 the size of the trophy is about 4 cm (1 1/2 inch ) tall, the size of the trophy doesn't appear in the seller's description 
 Based on the ratings, I suspect kindhearted people think they SHOULD praise this film because of the likeability of its stars.  But from the heavyhanded appearance of "Death" to the self-conscious acting styles to the endless songs (you deserve a medal if you don't ever hit fast forward), this simply does not even approach the charm, wit and easy musicality of the Prairie Home Companion radio show.  Also, the DVD transfer seems a bit dark 
 I tested the product with both my desktop and laptop, and the recording from the microphone generates tons of static...it's simply not acceptable. ....just no way that I can use it to talk through voip... :(  
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original "ReAnimator" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks 
 Every day I drive long distances so I thought that getting this on CD would be worthwhile.  Unfortunately, the author narrates her book which I think is a big mistake.  She has a very distracting accent and reading style.  It doesn't help that she begins the first chapter by giving us a detailed description of the daily activities of her cat.  After tolerating about two and a half minutes of this, I skipped to the next track.  That was about 9/11.  I don't have any fear or anxieties about terrorism so I skipped to the next track.  The subject matter sounded interdesting but again, I just couldn't get past her accent.    I really think that unless authors are good speakers, they should leave the narrations to trained professionals. 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 This book is just so boring, I don't know why my English teacher is going nuts about this book.  All it is about is an insane old man hanging on to a fish for 3 days or 5 days I can't remember.  I know Ernest Hemingway is  recognized by many people the greatest American writer. But this book as an  intro to Ernest Hemingway for High School students, NO WAY!  Making HS  students reading this as their first Hemingway book is a BIG MISTAKE! Start  with something else, after reading this book we all praised god and sighed  in relieve after being tortured to read the boringest book we had ever  read.  There are better, way less boring books by Hemingway.  I read so of  the other books of his after I read "The Old man and the Sea" and  I am glad I did. I know all the Hemingway fans are all nuts about it 'cause  it is his last piece of work and maybe somehow tell us a little about  himself before he commited sucide.  But please TEACHERS, as much as you  like Hemingway, don't make your students read this book for Hemingway.  It  does more harm then good.  I reckon no one in my English class is ever  gonna pick up and read a Hemingway book again.  So please do the right  thing 
 This movie just misses being something special... what could it be?  Peter Sellers is my favorite actor but the accents he uses in this movie don't work.   Perhaps the biggest obstacle to viewing pleasure is Tom Bosley's role as an absentee father - his acting is stiff and pretentious.  When he says his lines, it's like he's reading them right off the script. Make-up!  Mr. Bosley's smoking jacket! Take ten! The teen-age girls are adorable, Gilbert's mother and mother's friend are right on the mark, as well.  But Paula Prentiss!  I kept wondering why Henry Orient would keep pursuing her - with her neurotic mannerisms and skinny old self.  Altogether this flick is mediocre at best 
 This was possibly the worst use of my money, EVER.  Learned nothing new.  Well, maybe I did learn that I'm already as good a leader as some of my peers, and a better leader than most since I found the "practices" in this short pamphlet (can hardly call it a book) to be no more than common sense 
 i had never heard of anne tyler before i started seeing this book's  hardcover edition all over town. four years later i saw the book again at my local library and decided to pick it up (the demure nape had always intruiged me). what a mistake. i found it redundant, to the point where at certain spots, after i had set the book down, i was positive i had picked it up 10, 15, 40 pages earlier at a passage i'd already read. i soon realized, indeed, i was on the correct page, it was just that a nearly-identical scene was again playing itself out on the page.   how many times does the reader have to experience Rebecca's regret, nasty step (and full) daughters, her doddering senior citizen charge or squeemishness at the touch of her once-true-love? it was the same disappointing non-event over and over.   and i thought this book was also a shameful depiction of one woman's sorry, horrible life. it felt as though she was a mute doormat. i suppose it could be considered a "real" story but Rebecca's lot in life seems to be romanticised. it's not romantic or wistful or nostalgic, it's just sad. 
 This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it 
 My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.  It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.  I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!  As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence 
 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 A tired attempt to re-run the ancient heresy of Gnosticism. May impress ignoramuses who know nothing of theology. I attended Fox's lectures in Western Australia a few years ago. They were an incoherent babble of scientific gobbledegook, historical nonsense and psychological trickery. I am not a Catholic but I don't wonder the Catholic Church unfrocked him 
 My 15-month old loves his big sisters' "10 Little Ladybugs", so I bought this bee book for him.  The buzzing sound only works half the time and the cut-out bees on the cover aren't on every page (as in other similar books).  A disappointment, for sure.  
 In a word, disappointing.  Reese sets out to document the machinations of the Catholic hierarchy, satisfactorily covering the structure and official mission of its various parts.  The energy he devoted to questioning Vatican officials is apparent, yet is also the book's shortfall.  As an insider, Reese writes what could easily pass for an authorized biography; the Pope could read this with nary a blush (was that the intent?).  Interspersed with the occasional slap on the wrist for good measure, the book seems to have only one source for information on how (in)efficiently the Vatican functions: the Vatican itself.  Missing is any analytical scrutiny, external sourcing, or simply a ounce of skepticism of anything emanating from Vatican lips.  Some utterances are downright banal: "...everyone agrees that the Vatican is better run and more efficient than the Italian bureaucracy."  It would be hard to contrive a more meaningless analysis.  Reese is an insider's insider; those looking for a documentary or expose can look elsewhere.  But if you want the sanitized version, I recommend calling the Vatican and avoiding the middleman 
 I have found Hibernate In Action to be an indispensible guide when developing Hibernate persistence solutions, so I was eagerly awaiting the release of its successor.  Most developers will want to use standard JPA as much as possible for portability reasons, and only use Hibernate where absolutely necessary to use features not supported by JPA.  However this book fails to cleanly separate discussion of JPA from Hibernate, meaning that if you take this approach to using JPA you end up wading through large sections of the 800+ pages of this weighty tome.  I have to agree with Ganeshji and C. Updike - this lack of any clean separation of JPA and Hibernate makes it difficult to get useful information out of the book.  This is a shame, as the writing is of a high standard - unfortunately the content is very poorly organised. 
 $.50 is half a buck too much.  This is not is hindsight.  I read it  long ago and it made no sense then.  Try Odom instead 
 I have been studying astrology for twenty years and practicing it for a few.  I bought this book based on the glowing recommendations here on Amazon.  I wish I had not.  The premise of the book is sound.  It is that, unless something is promised in the natal chart, then it will not manifest in the life of a client.  But the author almost immediately contradicts herself.  On page 42 she says: "We are not stuck with the natal promise of our chart.  There is always the potential to outgrow the more difficult aspects."  WHAT?  Does the natal promise matter or does it not?  Please make up your mind!  From there it just gets worse and worse.  The chapter called "The Natal Promise" is laughable and exemplary of the rest of this book.  The author reduces everything to childish, ridiculous generalizations.  For example, the entire section on "Success" is about the Nodes.  Apparently, at least if you follow her advice, you have no chance of success unless your North Node is in an angular house (1, 4, 7 or 10).  In the section "Violence/Rape," all she discusses are hard aspects between the Moon and Pluto.  Try telling my friend who was savagely raped and beaten that she must have imagined it happening to her since she has no aspect in her chart between the Moon and Pluto.    Not only is this book shoddily written and edited, as another reviewer mentioned, but there are some GLARING errors.  In the section on "Vocation," page 68, she claims that "Jackie Kennedy had her tenth-house Neptune in Scorpio, and she was a book editor."  Well, Neptune did not even enter Scorpio until 1956 so unless Jackie O. was about seven years old when JFK was shot, then this is completely impossible.  Finally, a large bulk of this book, maybe a third of it, is devoted to childish, cookbook interpretations which are vastly oversimplified.  But my biggest complaint comes with the author's system of making predictions itself.  It ultimately relies on eclipses, progressed house cusps and the position of the progressed Moon in order to pinpoint dates and times of events.  This, in my experience as an astrologer, simply doesn't work.  And as someone else noted, she makes no mention of Solar Arc Directions whatsoever.  The author's rambling narrative and anecdotes occasionally bring up an interesting observation here and there.  But based on all of her other glaring errors and omissions, it makes one wonder if her observations are even worth considering.  Ironically, she even promotes in the introduction to the book that astrologers develop a "personal method" in making predictions (in other words, she is suggesting that you may not want to use her method).  Honestly, I'm amazed that her method has worked for her, but if you are expecting it to work for you, then you are likely in for a big surprise.     This book was a huge waste of my time and I wish that I had not purchased it 
 This a wonderful book to read to children or to read yourself.  It tells the history of this Country of Ours in story form.  This makes the reading of it very fun and exiting.  The book also includes some wonderful drawings in color.  Don't miss.  It will make you proud to be an American 
 This is a fun film and one of the few from the period where Jet just seems to have some fun and go off. But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product. 
 I bought this book thinking it would be a good read before my husband and I started trying for a baby. The cover captions looked like there would be some great information inside. However, when I got the book and read the table of contents I immediately realized it was a book about infertility. I only give it 1 star not based on the content but on the misleading cover of the book. I'll have to pay better attention next time 
 I found useless this book. I returned it 
 Like the reviewer you will find below, I found the the first 75 pages boring.  It was all descriptive narrative and no real action--and describing the same thing over and over and over and over.  UNlike the reviewer below, however, I never found the remaining book as interesting as the first one by this author.  In my opinion we've got a one-trick pony, here 
 its good to be informed about the enemy(racist pieces of S@#%) other than that no real valu 
 What a difficult movie to sit through.  It went all over the place with very little character connection.  It had senseless violence, senseless nudity, and left you with nothing at the end.  I found it to be an excruciating 2.5 hours.  The sad thing is that I think Ragtime could have been really good and could have taught about social issues and history.   It could have changed peoples' understanding of prejudice, inequality, racial issues, women's history, etc. but it didn't teach or entertain. 
 We used this book about four years ago and found it very helpful in providing the basic information about schools for our oldest son.  So, when our youngest started pondering the college choice, we ordered this edition thinking it would again be helpful.  Were we wrong!!  This edition is very unreliable.  I am sure that Stanford would be pleased to know that although the class of 2009 had 20,195 applicants with only 2,426 admissions, their selectivity rating is 89!  And with a freshman class of 1,633 they have a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,858.  This is an obvious error, but how many of the other schools, maybe not as well known, have been misrepresented by this guide?  Princeton Review needs to send us a refund 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 I love 70's horror movies like the exorcist and The Changeling.  This movie is so stupid, I turned it off half way through.  It's poorly acted and not in the charming way that so many older movies are either.  I would suggest renting it before you buy.  I just don't know what other reviewers saw in this.  
 There is not enough cheese and crackers in this world to go along with the "whine" that Ms. Lamott serves up in Plan B.  I have loved her previous works and based on their merit, I pushed on into this book, beginning each new chapter with hope and ending in dissappointment until I finally had to toss it into the garbage.  It was tedious, from menopausal maladies to blaming George Bush for all the problems in her life.  And God Himself, or "Herself", as Ms. Lamott would say, seems to be a reflection of who SHE is and not the other way around.  Yes, God loves us just the way we are but He also loves us too much to leave us that way...except in her case apparently.  I wanted to like it and I am sorry to say that it fell way below my expectations.  Bummer 
 i dont speak english fluenty so i will write down a few things hoping that u understand me.First of all the writer tell us that he don't believe in miracles(so he is not a believer)and this seems to reflect to the whole book.BUT the most important thing with this book is that it is full of personal opinions and speculations.The important thing when you are dealing with the new testament is being documentary.German books(not all of them) that deal with new testament still are the most complete ones.  I have read so many books dealing with new testament and i am tired watching that every writer(usually with great studies and bla bla)has his own opinion.Writers could hold back their arrogance and focalize to facts(historical and archeological sources and information)

 "Journey to the West" is a literary masterpiece which has been loved in China for nearly half a millennium.  In contrast, "The Lost Empire" is a piece of meretricious rubbish which will hopefully soon be consigned to oblivion.  Its makers seem to assume, rightly or wrongly, that its audience will be unable to relate to a "foreign" story unless a white guy is inserted, however incongruously, into the action.  As if this were not bad enough, the idea of the "hero" comducting a romantic affair with Kuan Yin must be deeply offensive to many people of Chinese extraction.  Since Kuan Yin is someimes compared, in her role as compassionate mediator, to the Virgin Mary, one can only imagine the response had the situation been reversed.  This is an example of film-making at its very worst 
 The entire premise of this book is "If you hold the bible up to the light of the full-moon while standing on one leg, one can plainly see how scriptures and science are in harmony" While I can think of many colorful short phrases to describe this book while it ricochets of the wall into the trash can, the initials "B,S" comes to mind.   Schroeder wants the reader to believe that the book of Genesis makes reference to Einstein's theory of relativity! Supposedly, Einstein's time-dilation explains why the Creation "days" are actually long eons of time and that quantum mechanics can be used to explain other apparent contradictions between Genesis and the findings of modern science.  Never, I say again never have mankind witnessed the establishment of a scientific fact that came about as a result of biblical investigation.  These pseudo scientists lurks in the murky shadows of biblical nonsense until real science reviles some wonderful and enlighten truth about our world.  Then they pounce and yell "Eureka!!!", bible in hand, ready to defile and hijack true scientific findings.   By reinterpreting the bible to conform to reality is nothing short of intellectual dishonesty.  For it is written starting from Genesis that "The evening and the morning was the first DAY!!!"  The evening and the morning was the second DAY!!".... so on and so on" "Six DAYS you shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh DAY is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.  For in six DAYS the Lord made the heavens and the Earth and rested on the seventh DAY"......Exodus 20: 9, 11.  Hence 1 day = 24hrs    Wouldn't it be fun to see how "science in the bible" explains how dead people rise from the tome and rejoin the living, how blindness, leprosy, paralysis are healed just by a mere touch????????            This book makes a mockery out of science and a travesty to critical thinking.  Click your heels together three times Mr. Schroeder then return to reality. The rest of us are waiting for you.    In Reason.  
 I loved this smoker the first two times I used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it didn't work at all.  After examining all the parts, I noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points.  It was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but I was forced to pay the shipping!  I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill 
 With so many beautiful books about the Booth family already out of print, it's a pity that this new book is of such poor quality. Those interested in learning about John Wilkes Booth would do far better to read Michael W. Kauffman's exquisite new biography, "American Brutus," or Gene Smith's "American Gothic," a book which, like this one, focuses on the entire family, but with far greater success and eloquence. (American Gothic, published in 1992, is already out of print, but can still be purchased cheaply online)  In "Good Brother Bad Brother," James Cross Giblin draws heavily on Eleanor Ruggles' 1953 biography of Edwin Booth. This is exceedingly unfortunate: Ruggles's biography is chatty to the extreme, and her sources are sketchy at best and rarely footnoted. Again, a better insight into Edwin's character will be found by reading the latter part of "American Gothic." Another good Edwin source is "Between Actor and Critic: Selected Letters of Edwin Booth and William Winter," which offers a decent picture of the latter part of Edwin's life. This is also out of print, but still very much available used 
 I am a huge fan of EFT and am always eager to learn more, but this book was a complete zero for me.  I haven't been this disappointed in a book from amazon.com in a long time.  The authors are more concerned with self-promotion than helping people, which gets in the way of their communication.  The content is vague, diffused, and very limited.  I would recommend instead Gary Craig's free manual, or Energy Tapping by Fred Gallo 
 This book looks as if it went to publishing without editing.  I have read a lot psychology and find the subject interesting.  I am educated - professional engineer and attorney.  I usually understand what I am reading.  But this book forced me to re-read sentences and paragraphs because I could not understand what the authors were saying.  Often I just moved on.  Either the authors were not sure themselves or I just couldn't get it.  But two things were clear, the book is written almost exclusively in the passive voice with high-sounding amorphous words that seem to be intended to leave you either in awe or just completely frustrated.  It reads like a first draft that went straight to publishing.  My wife found reading it painful at best and she never made it through.  The authors also seemed little concerned about citing their authority.  Do they just make this stuff up?  I felt the advice was unreliable.  
 To be fair, the legends of Herakles, as they were originally written, have little to do with this movie, but maybe that's for the best.  Having grown up on Superman, Batman and the Justice League, I have a hard time calling a person like Herakles a hero.  In the original legends, he was a warrior, but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage.  He also wasn't, as far as I can tell, as strong as in this version. Therefore, interpretations of Herakles are, I think, to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend, but on where and why. Disney has attempted to take Herakles (or Hercules, in the Roman) and make it a story about a true hero, and a perfect one at that.  There's nothing I like more than perfect heroes.  They inspire me.  Conceptually, I like the idea. Instead of Herakles being the illegitimate son of Zeus and a mortal woman, he's conceived in love by Zeus and Hera and turned mortal by a potion.  Not bad.  As changes go, it works better than most. Herc meets Meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him (another deviation from the legend, and a very good improvement.)  Of course, because Hera is his mother in this version, she can't be Herc's enemy, so they make his opponent Hades; lord of the dead, which could be worse, as changes go.  I've never seen Hades as being all that bad of a guy, but that's how it goes.  Then there's the Hydra, which is, if anything, much larger and more powerful than it was originally, so that's good too.  Aside from this, however, I have to say I was disappointed with most of the changes. The titans, to start with, were underplayed considerably.  It might have been premature to mention that they were Zeus' predecessors, but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had, and a roughly-similar appearance.  Oceanus, for example, lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose, or Cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence, particularly since Hercules didn't beat the titans alone in the original stories, nor does it make sense that he should in this one (grabbing a whirlwind?  Come ON now.) I actually didn't mind Hades' used-car-salesman demeanor all that much, though I didn't see a reason why he should have flame-based powers when that's clearly Apollo's territory.  Further, I thought most of the Gods and Muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature. Why is this the case?  I think Disney made the mistake, in this film, of not just trying to make the legends clean, but FUN as well, and there's nothing fun about war.  I'm not saying they couldn't have made the concept work.  In fact, I'm saying they could have made it work if they'd toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect (Justice League style.) Still, for what it's worth, this is one of the few movies left in the world that isn't afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero, and for that it's worth at least one viewing.  Rent it from your local video store, in my opinion, before you make your decision 
 Sometimes mentioned as one of the "banned books of the bible", the Book of Jubilees covers the same ground as Genesis and part of Exodus. It's one of the books of the Pseudepigrapha, which means "writings with false superscription", according to the introduction. I found it boring and difficult to read. It shares a similarity with the Oahspe bible in one instance, where Abraham is instructed to kill Isaac by an evil spirit ("prince of the Mastema"), and he doesn't because he realises that it's a spirit and not God communicating with him. It includes fragments of old texts such as the Book of Noah and there's more reference to Enoch than in Genesis.  Overall, I would recommend it only to obsessive or completist students/scholars of the Old Testament 
 Yes, President Bush is a rebel.  He rebels against the people of the United States and the Constitution.  Here are just a few examples of his rebellious ways:  1.   He turned a record surplus into a record deficit.  2.   He cuts benefits to the poor in order to fund obscene tax cuts to the rich.  3.   He manipulated and cherry-picked intelligence data in order to rationalize starting an immoral and unjust war.  4.   He lied to the American people about the reasons for starting that war.  5.   He allowed America's real enemies to escape justice in order to pursue his own selfish and unrealistic goals.  6.   He refuses to acknowledge the reality of the consequences of America's (and the world's) dependence on fossil fuels.  7.   He defies the Constitution of the United States by ordering the illegal spying of Americans and the torture of prisoners who are being held indefinitely without being charged.  Nearly 150 years ago our fore-fathers fought a Civil War to stop the rebels in this country who rejected our Constitution.  Now we have a President in the White House who basks in his rebel status and thumbs his nose at those who dare to challenge him.  Meanwhile, authors like Fred Barnes praise his rebelliousness, and millions of Americans rejoice in their self-proclaimed righteousness because it happens to coincide with their president's, and millions more simply stand passively mute. 
 I bought this and felt let down.  The instuctions are confusing, have too many cross references, and assume a certain amount of skill.  This is definitely not what I would call straight forward.  I would absolutely not recommend this to a beginner as it can be overwhelming.  I ended up not using one bit of information from this book.  I also found the ideas to be either too stuffy or relaxed, I couldn't find a middle ground.  I found Window Style to be much more informativ 
 I'm a huge Buckthead fan, but I have to agree with someone else's review that I read, It's not for Buckethead fans! There's way too much D.J. going on and a lot of repetivness. Buckethead doesn't even seem to be on the  C.D. 
 I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased 
 I just love it.  Here's another non-scientist accusing a world-renowned scientist (Marija Gimbutas) of being dogmatic (not to mention dead wrong about half of what she - Marija -- has ever written).    And then what does Ruether do?  She dances out with dogmatic statements of her own.  As my mother would say, "It's the pot calling the kettle black!"  Take the following, for example:  "The major stimulus for this development (from the relative peace and equality of  the Neolithic to the Bronze-Age hell of war, slavery and poverty) came less from outside nomadic invaders and their horses and more from internal developments triggered by the accumulation of wealth" (p. 39).   How does Ruether - a theologian -- know with such certainty that "The major stimulus for this development came less from outside nomadic invaders and their horses and more from internal developments..."?  One wonders: does she know anything about the vast literature on this particular subject?  About the competing theories?  Apparently not; she dismisses the entire area of research with one blithe paragraph bristling with certainty.    And how is it that a theologian is so certain that these internal developments were "triggered by the accumulation of wealth"?    Ruether doesn't seem to want to get to the truth in this book.  It seems to me she wants to hide the truth.  A big part of her agenda: We hafta hide the Neolithic Goddess because this goddess will hurt women.  She says the Neolithic goddess "duplicates what I suspect is one of the key roots of the need of males to dominate females -- namely, it identifies women predominantly as the representatives of the `natural.'  If women, and women alone, personify the forces of nature in the cycles of birth and death, either they need to be dominated by men in order to control these forces of nature, or they are the primary gender that will somehow `save' us from the destructive effects of millennia of male domination of nature" (pp. 39-40).   On the contrary, there's no reason to believe that a strong Neolithic goddess meant women and only women personified nature, or that there were no male gods anywhere in the time/culture period.  Does Ruether have a time machine?  Did she go back and check?    I'm afraid Ruether's speaking old-speak.  Younger women today know that just because women give birth doesn't mean men see them as mere bodies walking around with no heads, abilities, capabilities, or important place in the larger world.  Ruether totally denies the Goddess of the relatively peaceful and healthy Neolithic and devotes almost her entire book to those goddesses that haunted the hellish Bronze and subsequent ages, all of which have been defined by war, conquest, subjugation, social ranking and poverty - right up to the present day.        It's distressing that many theologians these days assume they know enough about science to write books on the subject.   Please, Ms. Ruether: leave the science to the scientists and stick to your Bibles.     
 ...advocates the death of American servicemembers, is avile man, and spews hate and venom in everything he writes.  Loser.  He is a partisan hack who seeks to divide the nation into a bluestate/redstate antogonistic civil war.  When George W. Bush dies someday, please bear in mind that, unlike Ronald Reagan--a duly-elected president--Bush will not be entitled to a state funeral or placing flags at half staff. As an illegal usurper who seized power extraconstitutionally, Bush should be buried at sea, in a simple shroud, and returned to the sharks that spawned him. Reagan, for all of his faults, should at least be acknowledged as a former president." Ted Rall's Blog Tuesday, June 08, 2004 
 Why do I call this nu-anime?  Because its like nu-metal, its watered down anime made extremely stupid and annoying to appeal to the masses, just like nu-metal.  FLCL is overrated by a bunch of fat, zit-faced goth girls in high school who can't get laid, listen to nu-metal, play DDR, hate American cartoons for no good reason, and think Hayao Miyazaki is god. Male FLCL fans are pretty much the same but 100 pounds lighter. FLCL belongs in the "nu-anime" category, along with InuYasha, the Boondocks, Samurai Deeper Kyo, and the various anime s*** thats aired on Adult Swim.  Back to the show, there's nothing special about it, its basically like Excel Saga (at least that show was funny) but extremelly stupid and annoying (like SpongeBob). You basically have this retarted alien girl who hits everything with a guitar and can't play it for s***, she "spices" up the lives of everyone in the town it takes place in. The rest of it is a bunch of retarted pop-culture references mixed with "insane" scenes and a HORRIBLE J-pop soundtrack, yet there's legions of fickle Americans who think this is genious.   If you want to watch REAL anime, not this pop garbage, watch these instead:  Akira Armitage: OAV series Ghost in the Shell Doomed Megalopolis Ninja Scroll Hellsing Steamboy Astroboy Transformers Wicked City LaBlueGirl  Watching this show doesn't make you different from the jocks or preps, it makes you retarded 
 If you're looking for a car harness that will keep your dog safe in an accident, keep looking... This harness might work to prevent your dog from bouncing around the car and possibly distracting the driver (although I'm not even confident it would hold up for that use with a big, strong dog) but I seriously doubt it would hold up even in a mild collision. The dog is held in place using a few plastic buckles/snaps which are not even very strong-looking-- I have seen stronger snaps on regular dog collars. Plastic snaps like these would not hold up to the forces created in a collision. If you want a safety harness that will protect your dog in an accident, look for one that has actually been tested/rated similar to human car safety devices 
 Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.  The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This "problem" became an asset later.  The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.  It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.  In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.  Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.  If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this 
 When I started reading this book, I was pretty into it, but then I got REALLY bored. It just seemed to move too slowly for my taste. I got bored with the characters and decided to give up on it. Hopefully I will enjoy her other novel, although I'm not definite that I will purchase it.. 
 This paint brush globs out the paint, doesn't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint. We went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it. Not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you can't get the brush in it to suck the paint up.  I am so disappointed 
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 Get the other one by Dennis Ricthie for a C reference manual.  This one is very difficult to follow 
 We bought this TV after reading glowing reviews only to find out that the picture quality is poor when viewed from slight angles.  Also, after 13 months of use ours has now died.  Sound works but picture is gone.  Cycling power on/off might bring back a partial picture for a few minutes but then it is gone again.  Another expensive lesson 
 Brueggemann is as always a good writer and his commentary is easy to read and very interesting. Howevever, a major problem is that it is difficult to dicern what he actually is commenting. Is it the literary text or the historical events? When Brueggemann for instance discusses Samuel or David he mixes the logic so that you never now if he is talking about the character or the "real, historic" persons and their motives. As a result he tend to introduce explanations - motives, parties etc - that is not the explanations of the text or the so called narrator. It would have been better if he had distinguished between the analysis of the text and his suggestions about "what really happened".   
 If you want bad gourmet recipes, then this is your book. The basic information is poor at best, and the "fancy" gourmet recipes are not even good. When I begin to cook a meal, i'll look in the "joy of cooking", get disappointed, and go and find what I want on the internet. The recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century. This book should have stayed there. I'm sure your grandma loves it though! squid in ink sauce?! for real? c'mon 
 I won't mince words. If you are relatively new to Maya, do not buy this book! Even if you are an experienced user, I would imagine it would be a waste of money. Very early in the book, I found myself becoming quite frustrated while attempting the tutorials as steps are missing or are just flat out wrong! I'm relatively new to Maya, but even I can recognize mistakes in the text. I'm cutting my losses and not continuing with the book as see a losing battle ahead. If there are problems with the simple, introductory tutorials, I can only imagine the headaches involved with the more advanced tutorials. Given the glaring errors in the text, I seriously wonder whether or not anyone bothered to proofread it!  Save yourself some money and pass on this book. I would not buy newer versions either unless the authors take some time to do a major overhaul of the text 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 Disciple is a band that, unfortunately, seems unable to find its way to the top of any audience's favorites list. Too unpolished to reach the top of the Christian rock scene and too typical to gain success in more indie-oriented circles, Disciple is perpetually cursed to mediocrity.  Admittedly, this album is a step in the right direction, seeming an improved successor both to the recent, pop-oriented self-titled album and the older, rawer releases like By God and Back Again. The beats are fast and the guitar riffs faster in songs like "Dive", "Regime Change", and "Game On". Unfortunately, the songs never seem to go much farther than that, opting for paths beaten to dust ten years ago or more rather than newer sounds.  The lyrics have enough biblical allusions to satisfy the religious audience, and the riffs have the tired feel that make this exactly the type of release that "old-school" Christian rockers will love, complete with the sleep-inducing power ballad "No End at All". However, in a scene that is increasingly developing lyrical and musical depth, Scars Remain simply can't compete--it has nothing really new to offer. 
 This book is a place to start at best.  The main part of Middle Eastern cook that I find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices. This book calls for dried spices at times.  The dishes don't produce the food that I remember eating growing up with my family. The book is not a total loss, however.  The spinach pies are acceptable.  There are many other books out there that I would recommend first 
 Very disappointed in the contents of this book. I expected more information and patterns 
 If Shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play "Othello", he would remove Heaven and Earth crying out for justice. Be an actor in a play of Shakespeare it's difficult and only the best ones can do it, not mediocre actors with face of children. What's Martin Sheen doing here? He should be in better movies and in this trash, if you want a good "Othello" adaptation, get the movie with Kenneth Brannag and Laurence Fishburne, are good actors and a better movie 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here late 
 I HATE THE BEATLES. THEY ARE AMONGST MY MUSIC GUIDE TOP 20 WORST BANDS EVER. THEY ONLY MADE A FEW DECENT SONGS IN HEY JUDE, LET IT BE, AND BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST STINK! EVEN A MARK KNOPFLER CD WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS IS BETTER THAN THIS! LIKE I SAID, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES OR ZEPPELIN DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ABOUT, HUH!!! GOOD MUSIC IS REQUIRED DIRE STRAITS, GREEN DAY, FOREIGNER, GNR, METALLICA, AND NIRVANA. GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED. THE BEATLES SUCK!!!! 
  The book is misleading as a lot of the stuff she uses to make her food I don't consider to be scratch. I was disappointed in the book although some of it was good 
 I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
 Fox must be ashamed to what it did to MTM show. I cannot believe Americans treat this american treasure as rubbish. MTM show deserves a fine release as the previous MTM show Season 1. It's time to not to buy more FOX DVD's until they finally know we are the ones who pay and we are the ones who have the control.     Is it so hard to be a FOX Executive member? Please, give me a job. I have some wonderful ideas for a perefect release. Don't you wanna loose money? OK, what about a special limited edition DVD? (As Disney used to do; available only for a limited time)     But NO, those executive don't have enough grey cells to think about it.      As a foreigner I enjoyed the MTM show and consider it a masterpiece and an American symbol. That's why i don't understand how FOX treats it so bad. Please, all together now for the future release of all seasons. And 'remember, don't buy The best of Season 1. It's a crim 
 This books main failing is that it ends up with Pages of listings of the methods that you can use in Ant which is not really why one buys a book in my opinion.  The book feels padded and does not have the feeling of a reference text that a team would use; rather it is functional and dry.  However, it does cover all the major aspects of Ant so it's not a complete loss 
 Why would anyone bother to read this when there is the lonely planet guide available? This is in my opinion a vastly inferior guide when compared not just to lonely planet but to many of the others available, it lacks  organisation and detail 
 Ms Rogers the "Queen of Romance" definitely fell off the throne with this story.  I was so disappointed by the lack of passionate, intrigue, and interesting characters that usually populate Ms. Rogers  stories that I want my money back. Unlike previous heroes and heroines  Amalie and Holt are dull and flat.  The only semi-interesting character Kit  Silver is left hanging.  Plot development lacked imagination and the  characters are cardboard. If you want to read a good romance book try some  of Ms. Rogers earlier stories like Sweet Savage Love, at least you won't be  wasting your money 
 Received this as a gift this Christmas and must say I was disappointed all things considered.  I found it lovely to look at, but not much beyond that 
 Within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off. This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect.  This is my third (and final) bread machine. The first two were Breadman Ultimates. I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average, pretty much every morning.  The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. This was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond).  I bought an new Breadman Ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. This time I took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down, no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed, making the machine useless. Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman.  At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one.  Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect.  I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate:  1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much. 2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense. 3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs. 4) The programmability options are very limited:  - You can't control the knockdown time between risings. - You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings. - You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle. - When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones.  - And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a "safety feature" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion.  For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations.  At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology.   All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination.  A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution.  I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology. It's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 Shearing, a pianist of great sophistication, pokes along on this recording to accomodate Feinstein's overall lame - and occasionally expiring - delivery of the lyrics.  If this were Shearing and a quartet, without Feinstein, the results would have been Shearing's usual delicious product, I'm sure.  Why is a great talent like Shearing yoked to a mediocre lightweight 
 I read all Jonathan Kellerman books, but this one put me to sleep. I was disappointed. I also think he should resolve this love interest and get Robin back. Allison needs to go. His books were better with Robin. These issues get boring after awhile 
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 Gary Paulsen's,My Life in Dog Years, is about all the Dogs owned in his life. Gary owned the dogs since he was a toddler to a fully grown adult.One of the dogs Gary owned was a Great Dane called Caesar,he was gentle and gigantic.As you'll read this you will understand why these dogs became so special to him in many ways.This book also has funny moments like when Dirk,the tiny watchdog,Gary owned when he was a child bit someone's pants off because Gary was being bullied.Emotional moments are also very common in this book like when  some dogs Gary found were missing,abandon,and lost.Reading this book will be easy for the young ones because they will understand how Gary feels about his dogs.An Audience older than 14 wouldn't be as interested.Overall this book has some short stories, were a reader can't get lost.I would recommend this book for an audience under 14 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 This is not a book you can use to rigourously  learn the fundamentals of image processing.  It's a good reference book for the techniques, giving formulas and some hand waving to accompany them - little is motivated, ir doesn't flow, is more a compendium of techniques used in the field accompanied by some text just to make the formulas less dry : the format formula/paragraph is repeated throughout; everything is treated at the same level hence the disjointed structure that doesn't flow.  Low on rigourous analysis; may be good as a collection of magazine articles but fails as a textbook on fundamentals - reading this book you'll know the how but it won't help you grasp the why 
 I love Bentley Little - ordinarily - but this short story stinks!  Not too much more can be said about it.  Boy meets dead dad in closed mall, dead dad wants boy to kill mom, boy doesn't kill mom, that's about it.  Save your money on the 'real' novels, and if you haven't read it, start with 'The Ignored' for a book that is worth the money 
 This is just blasphemy.  As a devoted (ridiculously, I might add) fan of the first, and appreciator of the second, I gotta give this one my lowest rating.  Fans of the series will find little to enjoy about this made-for-video release.   Clearly, Warner is trying to squeeze every last drop out of the Major League franchise.. 
 My wife and I have now spent a good month "learning" with this book. In fact more than 10 minutes a day,  more like 30 minutes per session. We both speak other languages, so we can compare.  GOOD, nice thematic picture groups,  and you need to learn the words associated with them.  (We did.)  BAD, again, and again Ms. Kershul introduces words,  and grammar which do not fit into the "just mastered"  scheme of things.  IRRITATING to the extreme: Ms. Kershul gives her instructions in a mixture of English  and Italian in one sentence.  (We would have preferred one line of Italian ONLY,  followed by one line --say in italics--  providing the English translation, in many cases preferably, with an explanations "how this compares to what was done yesterday".)  BAD: In attempt to NOT introduce grammar, you are left high  and dry figuring out gender, declinations, and worse conjugations by yourself.  (We have not yet seen satisfactory forms summarizing 'things',  and we are half way through the book).  In anger, we finally went to the local library  and got a 70 years old Italian grammar for High Schools.  That did solve our problem and left us convinced that "new and improved" does not necessarily  provide a better learning experience.  Somewhat IRRITATING:  Ms Kershuls's choice of vocabulary seems to assume that 1. you wish to visit lots of relatives  (not an uncle, niece, grandson, cousin, grandparent, or daughter  is forgotten in the family tree),  2. you wish to order meals and "buy stuff" constantly (we assure you, that is the one thing Italians are very good at, understanding English when you want to  buy things or order a meal)  3. you wish to tell Italians that you are "American"  (as if our accents and clothing are not dead-give-aways)  4. you pray "catholic", "protestant", or "Hebrew".  (the Italians we know couldn't care less -- how about instead "politics", "music", "movies", "soccer"  and the "bella ragazza" over there)  In summary, we are ready now to look for a book which does not claim to be "easy, in 10 minutes a day",  but emphasizes grammar,  groups vocabulary (and discusses alternatives for each new word),   provides clearer indication of emphasis in the pronounciation (example: telEfono, versus incorrect tElefono) Teaches Italian as a language of "constructed" full sentences, rather than "single catch words". ------------------  Our final test,  No, we would not recommend this book to a friend 
 Not as great as I had hoped.  Too much of her later stuff, which is when she got worse 
 Per the editorial review:  "In his own writings, Paul draws from Mithraic vocabulary and symbolism."   That's interesting, considering the earliest Roman mention of Mithras was by Statius (ca. 80-92 AD) and modern scholarship places the earliest known Roman Mithraic bull-slaying monument to ca. 100 AD (see Richard Gordon, "The date and significance of CIMRM 598 [British Museum, Townley Collection]", JMS 2, 1977-8, 148-74) and Paul was dead by then.   If this author was using the outdated work of Cumont to develop this untenable theory - well, that's simply embarrassing.  The controversial theory of David Ulansey offers no earlier concrete evidence either as all he has to go on is the second hand (or made up) account of Plutarch who connects the Roman cult with some Cilician pirates ca. 62 BC.  But beyond this unsubstantiated literary reference the only concrete evidence for the Roman cult appears in the latter part of the 1st century AD...after Paul had "flourished."    
 The chefs asked to relate their biggest catastrophes seem to have misunderstood that direction. Instead, most of them have used this forum to impart their bottomless pits of wisdom, and stroke their own egos at the same time. Aside from a couple (trust me, only about two were real culinary catastrophes) of anecdotes, this book was  monotonous. The "catastrophes" consisted of chefs relating their travel experiences in France, "how-to" advice for starting your own restaurants, and other stories that have really nothing to do with culinary catastrophes. Most frequently the chefs would include a moral of the story at the end of his/her piece.   The only two worthwhile stories are from Tony Bourdain and the Two Hot Tamales.   Don't buy this book. Go to the bookstore and read the two stories I mentioned above. It will take about ten minutes and make you laugh. If you buy this book and read the whole thing, it will take you hours to read and in the end you will cry that you spent money on this literary catastrophe 
 The only Michael J. Fox film that is worse than "Bright Lights, Big City", is "Light of Day" with co-star Joan Jett. Fox gives a good performance considering, but I would call both of these films "duds". Every actor has to make a few appearances in bad films, to pay their dues, so to speak, to acquire name recognition within the industry. This film was made before Fox's career really starting taking off. He came off running good in "Back to the Future", but "Bright Lights, Big City" was nothing more than a stumbling block to his career, in my humble opinion. This film was not well written, poorly directed, distasefully done. It is boring and the subject matter goes way overboard into the drug scene. I felt it gloried a lot of disgusting things. I was not at all impressed. The acting was good, casting was good, good cinematography, but just a very poor screenplay to begin with, for which there is no resurrection. Not something I would recommend. There are many other movies to choose from that are entertaining, and well done. This is not one of them 
 Meshuggah was one of those bands that made music so different from everyone else, you had to believe they were from another planet. Every album that they released was with a determination to remain a musical journey and challenge at the same time. From the None EP to Catch 33, this band just got weirder and weirder with each release. Some of the material made you question whether Tomas Haake had eight arms, if Fredrick Throndel conjured up evil spirits to deliver his solos, or if Jens Kidman was in fact the reincarnation of satan himself.  Well, folks all of that comes to an end on this release. Meshuggah thought that they made a mistake on the sound of 2002 release Nothing. The notion of a mistake is something that comes with humans, not Meshuggah. I always saw Nothing as Meshuggah's extra terresterial release. It was the sound after the apocolypse. Unfortunately, the band and I did not seem to agree. With this re-release, Meshuggah's unique presence is merely a presence. Everything that was great on the first release is missing here for a little better guitar sound. Jens Kidman's in your face vocals took a back seat. Tomas Haake's blistering snare drum sound got pushed all the way to the trunk. In return, the drums are hardly audible at times and just downright non-apparent on some songs. Even this "improvement" in the guitar production makes what was such a dense record seem bland instead. The atmosphere of this re-release is completely missing from start to finish.   One last little qwarl that I had with the record was the DVD portion of the album. Let me ask the readers something, do you enjoy almost having a seizure when watching live dvd shows? Most concert DVDs that I purchase seemed forced on the idea that during the heavier sections of songs that the camera's focus should jump and transfer around. I, personally, just want to see with clarity the band doing what they do best. I've seen the band twice live and I must say they put on the most devastating live shows one's eyes will ever see. It is a treat to have these songs with great audio quality, and the music videos are very entertaining as well.   I wish I had more kind things to say for such an amazing band, but this release, for the most part, is VERY dissappointing. Meshuggah remains the pinnacle of the metal world in my eyes. Hopefully their next full length will be another stellar release in a long line of success. Until then, i'll stick to my 2002 copy of Nothing 
 These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much! 
 A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth 
 Even though this is the revised edition, I have been told by professionals in the children's book industry that the information I got from this book is out-of-date and incorrect 
 This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end. For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?   ...And many more! 
 Mark's clever as a wizard but just as cold.  For fans of technique only, those to whom concerns for the characters don't matter, but being post-modern and just plain edgy is as good as it gets.  Steve Vai plays more notes than Mozart, but never played a memorable tune.  Costello's so wound up in "being a writer" that he forgot to make his readers give a damn.  Maybe next time, because a good book's probably in there somewhere 
 Have had this less than two months and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times a week on slightly spritzed hair to tame the frizz.  The thing died!!  Did work great while it lasted....  Now trying a Conair, so keeping my fingers crossed 
 I was looking for the classic tale of Frog meets Princess and mistakenly picked up this book.  Dreadful.  First, although we have liked James Marshall's artwork elsewhere, there's nothing special here.  The drawings are simple and generally uninspired.  Second.  Who thought a rewrite with the princess slamming the frog against the wall was a good idea?!?  Not us.  In fact, my husband nixed the idea of reading this to our small children after he gave it a preliminary perusal.  From the book:  That made the princess very  angry. She picked up the frog, and  she threw him against the wall! But when he fell to the  floor; the frog was no longer  a frog.  Note that there is no explanation of why this outburst led to the witches spell being broken.  [Perhaps we should slam each other around to see if there's a prince or princess hiding within--lol]  Two Stars.  So-so art.  Not true to the original tale.  
 A sorry science fiction book (not a mystery novel in my judgement) not written by Ludlum but his name is on the cover to sell books (my viewpoint). The book takes advantage of todays terrorist threats and smallpox concerns to stir the readers interests but nothing in the book reflected the writings of Ludlum. I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, "The Paris Option" 
 I am a artist and bought this book for reference for painting bears. I discovered I could have taken better photos of bears at the zoo than what is in this book 
 CONCERNING THE DVD:  Yet another MGM quickie, containing the film in its correct 1.66:1 aspect ratio with some nicely restored video elements.  The footage from other films that was edited in looks poor. The 2.0 Mono soundtrack is in good shape. There are basic subtitles in French and Spanish, scene selections as well as a beat-up trailer.   CONCERNING THE FILM: (from my website, www.angelfire.com/film/eurowar)  The always-overrated David McCallum is one of the few good things in this low-budget World War II adventure piece, yet another quickie from Oakmont Films.   Sometime prior to D-Day - probably early '44 or '43 - a Mosquito Squadron is sent to bomb a V-1 rocket installation in France, when Squadron Leader Scott (David Buck) is shot down and presumed dead. His second-in-command, Quint Munroe (who just happens to be like a life-long brother to him) has to return to England and tell his beautiful blonde wife (Suzanne Neve) the sad news. As one would expect, Munroe and Mrs. Scott slowly fall in love. But when Munroe is chosen to lead a mission to bomb a new V-3 development center, things will chance quite a bit - because Scott is a prisoner held at the target fortress!   From start to finish, "Mosquito Squadron" is a total hack-job - literally. The story is filled with enough contrivances and clichés to drive any mildly serious critic mad. Let us take a brief look at a 1964 film entitled "633 Squadron". In said film, a squadron commander has a best friend shot down over Norway, and falls in love with his sister. Later on, he is assigned to bomb the fortress where his friend is being held. Sound familiar? And that's not all our title film steals! Virtually all of the aerial battle footage is directly lifted from "633 Squadron", while the new footage is comprised almost entirely of horrible-looking miniatures hanging from far-too-visible wires.   The writers have also directly copied another classic war film, "The Dam Busters". The feasibility of Munroe's mission revolves around a bouncing bomb, which will skip along the ground and roll into an open tunnel leading to the V-3 rockets. (I won't even mention how convenient it was to leave a big open tunnel to drop a bomb into). The real bouncing bomb (made famous in 1954's "The Dam Busters") was designed to skip on water to destroy Nazi dams - not the ground as is seen here! The idea of dropping a bouncing bomb on the ground is, simply, ludicrous and impossible. Introduction of this concept kills the storyline immediately.   The low budget shows up in every action sequence: the French resistance force is comprised of a half-dozen men in berets carrying Sten guns, and only a handful of German guards enforce security at the "fortress". The forests are obviously cheaply furnished soundstages, and a face-off with an imitation German "tank" is ludicrously shot. We never really see much of the German-held Chateau, and when we do it never looks as though we're inside some high-tech development center a la "Operation Crossbow". The scenes set in England fare somewhat better, with some excellent scenes set at airfields and a rather rowdy officer's club.   David McCallum and the cast of little-known English actors do a fair job, even though the no-frills script doesn't give them much to do. McCallum is a fair actor, nowhere near as great as his fans hail him to be, though. He was better suited for television than cinema, and that comes out in every scene. He often looks uncomfortable and awkward, but delivers his often banal dialog convincingly and with conviction. His scenes with Neve are often touching, even though audiences have seen this dozens of times before. There aren't any other actors worth mention among the ensemble, besides perhaps Charles Gray who would go on to play Blofeld in the James Bond film "Diamonds are Forever" a few years later.   Oakmont Productions financed a number of cheap British war films in the late 1960s and early 1970s: "Attack on the Iron Coast", "Hell Boats", "The Last Escape" and "The One Thousand Plane Raid" among them. These quickies were best suited for TV viewing instead of theatrical release, but United Artists picked them all up and put them on the big screen. Anyone expecting a classic here - or in any of the aforementioned pieces for that matter - is in for a big disappointment. Check out "633 Squadron" instead.  
 Fast, easy page-turner (I read it in one day) that gives interesting insight into what it may have been like growing up during the Cultural Revolution. Although it is insightful and terribly sad at times, it was way too underdeveloped and never reached its full potential. I wish the writer had gone much more in depth with the charachters and their anguish, love, fear,lives,passions and ambitions.  This was the first book I have read by this author and am curious about her other novels, only because of her positive reviews. However, this book wasn't a "must-read" at all- I would recommend it only if you have an interest in Maoist China and the Cultural Revolution, or a few spare hours to read an entire book.  
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay.  They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life.  After wearing them for less than a week, I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin.  There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes.  As you walk, it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable.  I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product.  
 This is a really strange soundtrack because it doesn't succeed in conveying the mood of the film at all. Quite a few of the tracks are upbeat, jazzy numbers and I have no idea where these were used in the movie. The fact that the NIN closer remix isn't here is annoying as it really does set the tone in the opening credits but I don't really care since I have that mix on the single anyway. The reason I bought this CD was for the Bach Air piece, which totally blew me away in the film and stuck in my head for ages. Basically I wanted to have that on CD without getting a whole Bach CD since I'm not into that kind of music generally....so I'm happy, even if this soundtrack as a whole is pretty slight. The score pieces are worthwhile and appropriately dark and I was pleasantly surprised by the Thelonius Monk contribution, since I've rarely listened to any jazz...All in all, there is some good stuff on here but it doesn't remind you of the movie at all, except for the Bach piece, which is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard 
 While this seemed like a good guide while planning the trip, in actual fact it was not terribly useful.  It's poorly organized, so trying to figure out, on the fly, if there is a decent restaurant near an attraction means flipping back to the index too many times.  The author also gave starred attraction prominence to a couple of places where she qualified it in the description with, it may take too long to get here for too little to do.  Hmmm.  Also the restaurant guidelines needed some sort of a noise index.  This is one of those books that assumes kids will only be happy in an atmosphere of Disneyland-like frenzy.  I like my kids to eat a normal variety of food (not chicken fingers or cheeseburgers only) in normal restaurants.  The two restaurants we tried from the book were so unbelievably loud with non-stop sensory stimulation we couldn't speak to one another.  After that I ducked into a bookstore and bought Fodor's Around NYC With Kids and packed this one permanently in the suitcase.  I want a guide that lets me know if a place can tolerate a crying baby -- I don't need the waiters always dressed in "character" doing floor shows to get my kids to eat 
 Well-a last a long-awaited update to the, despite some minor quibbles, excellent 1994 price-guide by N. Umphred.... But it doesn't take more than  a few minutes to discover that this is a serious letdown. This is basically  a photo-copy of Umphred's Book with all the excellent details an easily  readable format edited out? . This has apparently been compiled without  ANY real research, insight or interest for that matter in Jazz Vinyl  collecting. The only excuse for the release of this  text-book-example-of-cashing-in-on-other-peoples-reputation-and-work is the  unavailability of Umphred's edition. Owners of this previous edition should  stay way clear of this.. 
 I am a Nancy Drew fan...for over thirty years..as my mother was before me and my daughter after me.  This rewitten version is not up to the thrills and chills of the edition by Mildred Wirt Benson in the 1930's.  This  edition lacks the intrige of the first..it is more "up to date"  and P.C. than the first, but I suggest that anyone who loves Nancy and has  only read this book obtain a copy of the original that has been published  by Applewood Books..it even has the fantastic old illustrations 
 The book makes me think of garage grade cabinets. These are the low end of the scale but the color pictures look good. I would never buy these types of cabinets or make them for my home 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 I found the heroine (ZD) so flatly written that she could only come off as a selfish, flightly idiot. She never has a chance to be a real person nor to have any real character.  To anyone reading today, with any smattering of enlightenment, I believe Zulieka Dobson will be frustrating and annoying.  She's set up to make a mean-spirited point.  I suggest picking up Evelyn Waugh or Nancy Mitford to get some fine writing on the society of the between-war period and the English upper classes 
 JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT  THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT LIKE "THEY ROCK" OR "THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT" AREN'T EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS. IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC 
 If you've read one Gary Null book, you've read them all.  He is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject, but when I buy two books with different titles by Gary Null and find they are the same, I'm pretty annoyed.  His early books were taken directly from Herbert Sheldon's Natural Hygience material, which I assume must not have been copyrighted, and I felt ripped off then, in the 70's as I did recently when Amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books.  
 Both the book and the film is full of exaggeration, revenge and hatred towards Turkey and Turks. Only 30-40% of the story may be true which I am pretty sure would also be the same in many countries 36 years ago. All the rest is full of lies. But portraying one of the worlds most interesting and beautiful city like it was is a real shame and pitty. I am a Greek living in Athens who visits Istanbul and beaches at the south of Turkey with my family at least twice a year and know what I am talking about. I don't know anyone who was in jail but dealt with police a few times and everyone was always nice and very helpful especiallyy to foreigners. 
 I read The Big Nowhere in two sittings, having read The Black Dahlia, and LA Confidential.  Ellroy is an immensely talented writer with enormous literary gifts which it is cliche to say transcend the genre.  In The Big Nowhere he weaves fact and fiction, plot lines and characters in a classic noir rendering of LA law enforcement post-Dahlia.  But there are things that clunk and in my opinion mar the overall effect.  A small instance is the use of the Johnny Stompanato character--read the Wikipedia article on Mickey Cohen, and I think it is obvious what I mean.  At one point the Ellroy Stompanato says to Buzz Meeks, I suppose you'll intorduce me to Lana Turner.  Come on, it's a clunker.  But I think the fatal flaw in the argument that this is a masterpiece, was the Dr. Lesnick device, that serves as denoument.  It's not at all a bad idea, but it comes across like an exhausted writer trying to end the book rather than something more organic to the plot.  The episode was promising but ultimately preposterous, and I think unnecessary.    There was also an unnecessary loose end with the corrupt Irish cop and the Sleepy Lagoon Murder which is made incongruous by Meeks actions relative to the Ellis Loew invetigation.  I read Ellroy, despite his dystopic and misanthropic view of the world, or the period, because he is a brilliant writer.  But I think for all of his psychic energy, he could be more disciplined and actually write a masterpiece.  The Big Nowhere was not a masterpiece 
 Seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants.  So now it sits in my car fading in the sun.  Save your money 
 This is the worst sequel I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first one ,but did it have to be this cheesy and boring. They aged mia, got rid of michael, threw her together with some loser, and made up some bogus law about marriage. I was really disappointed 
 I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book.  At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.    Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one 
 While purporting to 'embrace objectivity and think critically', LeGault repeatedly fails to do either.  His gratuitous bashing of other countries based on single figures from surveys smacks of both sloppy thinking and chauvinism.  As an example, to substantiate his view that the US is unfairly maligned as crime-ridden, he quotes a report that Sweden, "the United Nations' perennial merit-badge winner", has double the assaults of the United States, 667 versus 313 per 100,000. Could this statistic, if it's real, result from differential rates of reporting crime?  Quite possibly. Would it be reasonable to mention also that many reports indicate that the US has a homicide rate that's roughly 5 times that of Sweden?  Probably, if you are a critical thinker and/or concerned about crime rates.  LeGault also uses an unreferenced survey that supposedly indicates that two-thirds of Canadians say the US is a negative influence in the world to justify a rant about the "myth and balderdash dished out by the country's legions of left-leaning scholars and pundits". How objective of him to conclude, "it is not enough to scream 'Hypocrites! Ingrates!'" As a Canadian, I suspect that we do try to maintain a balanced view of the contributions of the US, both positive and negative, on the world scene. LeGault's reasoning implies that that because Canada is "dependent on trade with the US", anything that hints at criticism of American foreign policy is unacceptable.  There may well be some value to this book, however, it will require a concerted effort by the reader to separate the valid arguments from many that appear to be invalid or based entirely on such emotionally loaded thinking 
 The premise behind this book is that by following the techniques advocated by the "Fools," you can pick stocks on your own and do better than the market as a whole and better than most professional mutual fund managers.  Think about it.  If this premise were true, then most of the professional mutual fund managers would be out of a job, replaced by anyone that could follow the "Fools" advice.  The book is principally a big advertisement for the Motley Fool's web-site (www.fool.com) and much of the content it references isn't even there any more.  For instance, the book references real world stock portfolios called the Rule-Breaker and Rule-Maker which you can supposedly see and follow for free on their web-site.  If you search google, you'll find a page on their web-site announcing that both have been discontinued.  I'm guessing it wasn't because of their stellar performance.  Fortunately, you can still *buy* the Motley Fool Rule Breakers Newsletter for $199.00 per year.  Whew!  The book also announces the creation of a new stock index, which the book calls the "NOW 50," but which the Fools renamed "Fool 50" after the book was published.  Today, if you go www.fool.com's stock index section, you'll find no reference to the index.  You can still find links to the old pages if you search google (fool.com "fool 50"), but not if you search on fool.com.  An index that lasted no more than 3 years!  Amazing!  Perhaps the best critique of the Fools is in Investing for Dummies (Fourth Edition) on pages 382-383:  "[O]nly one of their seven portfolios has actually performed better than the market averages--two of their portfolios were shuttered after poor performance (one of which plunged 50 percent during its short six-month existence)."  Fools indeed!  By the way:  "Investing for Dummies" is a great book full of sound investment advice.  Make sure you get the latest editions (the Fourth was just released and the Third is still on many store shelves) The companion title "Personal Finance for Dummies" is also full of advice worth hundreds of times its cover price. 
 This is a REALLY bad book.  I was very disappointed in the complete lack of authenticity of the recipes.  That they should be simplified is something I've come to expect, but that they should be so inauthentic is inexcusable in this day and age when Chinese ingredients are so widely available--in supermarkets, Chinatowns, or online.  Here are some examples:  In the section on ingredients, Ms. Liley includes (Vietnamese) rice paper wrappers (although the Chinese do in a very few cases use a type of rice paper wrapper, it bears no resemblance whatever to the hard, glassy Vietnamese kind); she states erroniously that Spring roll wrappers are made of rice flour (see Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's "The Dim Sum Dumpling Book" for the authentic recipe and method); and she labels as wonton wrappers, which are square and egg-based, potsticker/gyoza wrappers, which are round and water-based.  In the recipe for Pearl Balls (p.26), she lists short-grain rice instead of glutinous rice for the coating, and suggests that the rice be soaked for 30 minutes.  I have been making pearl balls since I was 16 years old, and you *must* use glutinous rice, because even short grain non-glutionous rice won't soften in the relatively short steaming.  Also, the rice needs at least 1.5 or 2 hours soaking.  Finally, Ms Liley in recipe after recipe suggests fish sauce (widely used in Vietnamese, Thai, and Filipino cooking, but never in mainstream Chinese) as, presumably, a substitute for light soy sauce, since most Chinese recipes specify light soy sauce (or a combination of light and dark soy sauces) for fish or seafood-based dishes.  The photos are exquisite, but what good are glamourous photos when the content is so falsified?  Better to take the extra money and buy Lo's dim sum book, or the book "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Yee (the text is excruciating, but the recipes are good and really work), or for those who really want to get into this in depth, the dim sum books by Wei-Chuan Publishing 
 When you find yourself double-checking the bookjacket to see if the author you have enjoyed in the past could really have written this, it is not a good sign.  I can't even get into the book. I have read Catherine Coulter before, and while she isn't my favorite romance novelist, I have had only enjoyable experiences thus far.  That ended when I picked up this book from the library.   The dialogue is awful. There is no flow, they just randomly say things out of their mouths. There is no context for it either, no reason given for anything they say. And since what they say is so unbelievably corny, trite, or odd, you really need some kind of frame to put it in for it to have any meaning. I gather from the reviews that this contains characters from her other books, so maybe the context is there.  The whole conversation about discipline in the beginning pages also has no context. I found myself trying to picture this and trying to figure out what in the heck she really meant by discipline. Did it mean what I think it meant? Or something else? It wasn't super clear.  The man's character gives you nothing to work with. He's a womanizer and yet, he spills out a story about avenging his housemaid's demise.  Then he immediately blurts out "Why did I say that?" Why indeed? When he is questioning it, I know I'm in trouble.    And what is up with the whole "big girl" repetition? First, a big girl in my mind is someone with larger proportions--not necessarily someone tall. The "big girl" is gorgeous, but we have no idea why because the descriptions he pants about her don't describe anything. Just picture a goddess. There ya go. Got it?  Good.    Unfortunately I'm not going to make it to the whole "point" of this book, something about a treasure. I cannot, simply cannot get past these pages.  
 Kendermore was the most boring and pointless book I ever read it had no story whatsoever and one of my friend who had read tons of draonlance books before and loved the now stopped reading the because of Kendermore I love  dragonlance but Kendermore had no poin 
 How many stories can intrigue in Catholic Church spawn?  Berry tries to imitate Dan Brown (which is also, admittedly, his own basic style) but he really falls flat with this work.  Stock characters: a moderate dying pope, a somewhat secret liberal investigating priest, a conservative Catholic powerful priest/villan who is willing to murder to achieve his aims.  It all culminates in a real religious "truth" that shows that the powerful interests in the Church have really been working against the true will of God (in this case through various Marian appearances) for decades.    Not to be a spoiler, but the ultimate "secret" wasn't all that exciting either.  My own personal views are pretty much in line with Berry's so this is far from a political statement.  It just wasn't that much from a thriller perspective.  This one can be given a pass.  The lackluster plot sinks this one 
 I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD GIVE ME A VENUE TO SEARCH FOR SAMPLES OF PRODUCTS, BUT IT'S THINGS YOU CAN GET FOR A $1 OR $2. MOSTLY IT IS NEWSLETTERS AND BOOKLETS OR FREE -INFORMATION- ON PRODUCTS.I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$ IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!! 
 Without the strong leading performances of Donald Pleasance or Jaime Lee Curtis (only in this for about 10 minutes) this makes it the worst Halloween film to date. Much has been said about Halloween 4-6. I loved Halloween 4 & 5 and 6 was just okay however Danielle Harris should have been in that one as well. The series picked up again with Halloween: H20 but took another fall with this cheap piece of trash that was just looking to make a quick buck. I would watch Halloween III which doesn't even have the Michael Myers character in it as long as it meant I wouldn't have to be subjected to this again. The actors (acting) were terrible, the plot and storyline was severely weak, and the entire film as a whole just seemed fake and pointless. It's really a shame when a franchise has to be ruined with something like this (I felt the same with Jason X which is set in space). Lame. I'm pretending this one never happened. 
 This book looked adorable, so I borrowed it from our library and pre-read it, before sharing it with my 4 year old daughter.  Good thing I did!  At the end the little girls says she is allowed to say things she really doesn't mean (which is I am sorry) - what a horrible lesson to teach!!  "Remember kids, you can get out of anything if you fake remorse and lie to your loved ones!"  Parents be forewarned...it's not a book on morals and may even negate what you are trying to teach.  
 I bought the camera in May of 2006, as a graduation gift for my son.  He loved the style and compactness.  He experienced focus/zoom problems after 1 use.  Unfortunately he didn't start to use the gift for 2 months or I might have been able to return to Amazon for a refund.  Contacting Fufifilm has been overly cumbersome. Their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive (LONG WAITS).  They have had the toy camera (AS THIS IS BEING WRITTEN)for over a week and when I called yesterday for status, they told me that the camera "hasn't been diagnosed yet".  I expect it will be, once their 90 day warranty expires, which will limit Fujifilm's liability to the 1 repair.  I have a mean case of buyer's remorse.  I might as well have taken the ~$235.00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street.  If you own one and it doesn't require repairs, you might like it.  If it ever requires repairs, you might feel as I that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera.  Save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty, a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty.  You may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired.  I bought it in May of 2006....I feel like I lost it in July of 2006.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THE Z1 LESS THEN 1 STAR, I WOULD HAVE.  THAT'S WHAT IT DESERVES!   !&%$$##444EN FUJIFIL 
 My brother quoted a line out of Anchorman that immediately caused my wife to put it at the top of our Netflix list. We couldn't pass up the opportunity to see Steve Carrell screw up the news like he did in Bruce Almighty.   Anchorman has a plot, but does anyone care?  It's mostly about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) playing a 70s overconfident anchorman whose macho buddy-verse consisting of Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), and Champ Kind (David Koechner) is disrupted by the promotion of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) into their news ranks.  Mostly.  Anchorman is all over the place.  It pokes fun at news shows, like how they all hate each other like 50s gangs (and imagines them duking it out with bats in alleys).  It jokes about how the intelligence requirements to become a weatherman (Brick has an IQ of 48 and is "what some people call mentally retarded.") It mocks 70s fashion (Look at those shoes! That moustache! Those slacks!).  It painfully wrangles with the struggle of equality in the workplace.  Sometimes it's about the love between a man and a woman...and sometimes it's about the love between a man and his dog.  Anchorman's a lot of things, not all of them funny.  In fact, Carrell is far funnier than Ferrell, and he has a lot less lines.  Ferrell infuses Burgundy with a vague accent that he drops in and out of.  He says all his lines like a kid play-acting in front of his high school class.  Being funny takes a lot of work, but it shouldn't look like it: Ferrell seems constipated for most of the movie.  That leaves poor Applegate to shoulder the burden, bless her heart...but she's the straightwoman, so there's not a lot she can do to help.  It's hard to say a comedy is bad. Just about every movie can be funny, even unintentionally, and a judgment on quality humor is extremely subjective. I have to be honest, though: Anchorman feels lazy.  It doesn't really have a plot, the acting is terrible, and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal, bloody deaths.  I mean, jazz flute is funny and all, but after awhile you need to put the flute down and tell a joke or something.  The ending doesn't even make any sense (and it's clear, after watching what was cut, that they cut a major plot point).   I love Carrell though.  His lines alone make the film worth watching.  And now that I've seen it...  "I love lamp." 
 As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to "period" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating.  "Northanger Abbey" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works.  The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic.  Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood.  Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other.  (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture.  Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance.  
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 Well, here goes. Kates previous books were interesting and I could see this being a series as big as Jordans "Wheel of Time" But it seems that she has decided to try (unsuccesfully) to gather all the loose ends in this story so that she can have a finale in the next book. There is so much information in this book it was very hard to keep afloat. Sorry but this was a sad and lackluster book, hard to read and digest 
 I always thought of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, which I haven't seen, and the movie producer from WAG THE DOG, which I love. Or RAIN MAN, another fine film. But hey, the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it. Hoffman became Lenny Bruce. Bruce's material was great at times and awful at others. Nowadays, of course, none of it would be shocking. The film shows us Bruce's faults, unedited, presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses. But still, something is missing. Something crucial. I don't know what. I only know this film could have been so much better.  
 I bought this book for the buddhism section because of another review I read. I have to say I was very dissapointed. It contains almost nothing on buddhism, just a bunch of arbitrary forms and excercises with very little explanation on how this is supposed to increase your chi, and improve your metal clarity. I felt like i might as well be reading a book on  voodoo.  But what really put me off of this book was the section on Wushu qigong. I fail to understand the merrits of conditioning such parts of the anatomy as the solar plexis, throat, armpits, and yes, groin. Here is an excerpt;  p.256 Section 8, Groin Conditioning  Step 4. Pulling. Use both hands and grab a hold of the base of the penis, pull up and circle from right to left, 30-50 times; thenleft to right 30-50 times. Then pull forward and release 30-50 times. Next massage the dantion area until it is hot.   Step 5. Hitting with the edge of your palms and bamboo stick bundles...  I am not kidding. This is an actual excerpt. It then goes on to say that once you have conditioned your groin sufficiently you should start hitting your groin with a bamboo stick. Wow! Maybe they are not aware of the invention of the cup.   It could be that there is some information of real value in this book, but after reading this, and some of the other equally silly stuff, I couldn't see the point of wasting more time reading further 
 Phoebe Hoban's BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art is one of the few biographies of the painter whose brief career (1980-1988) coincided with the disgusting obsession with profit of the Eighties' art world. There is little here about his work itself, and in order to understand why Basquiat is so important you'll need a collection of his pictures.  The two big themes of the book are drugs and lots of sex with myriad women and men. I had the impression (like many, I assume) that Basquiat's sinking into drug addiction happened only after his corrupting fame, but Hoban reveals that he had been seriously abusing drugs since the age of fifteen. Basquiat's making an income by selling his body is also exhaustively treated, as are his relationships with Klaus Nomi, Rene Richards, Suzzane Mallouk, and others. The reader notices that a lot of things are being left out. It is obvious, and Hoban herself makes an allusion at one point, that Basquiat was somewhat well-read, but Hoban never talks about his intellectual activities or, with the exception of Cy Twombly, his discovery of his artistic predecessors.  After recounting Basquiat's death, there are two final chapters. The first describes the fights over his estate over the following decade. Hoban has Vrej Baghoomian coming out looking like quite the scumbag, and she describes the case of the several Basquiat forgeries. The chapter ends with a chilling visit to Basquiat's mother, now left extremely poor and mentally fragile even though she was entitled to fifty percent of all proceeds. The final chapter finally focuses on Basquiat's art itself, its themes and the painter's techniques. However, it isn't as substantial as other presentations of Basquiat's work.  If you love Basquiat's painting and really could care less who the man was, Hoban's biography has little appeal and that is why I have rated it rather low. I think that the book would be most attractive to those seeking to understand Basquiat in a historical context along with the 1980s art scene as a whole. That the work is very well-sourced makes it a useful guide to further research 
 Michael Gerber's concepts are excellent but this book is simply too confusing for the average small business owner.  Requires a consultant to help the reader implement what is in this book.  Wets the owner's appetite for what the business could become 
 I don't know if I just got an old/bad copy of the set, but for one thing, the episodes are misnumbered and out of order. More perplexing, however, is that some of the audio track is missing. For example, in ep. 1.08 (dunno what # it is on the DVDs), Apophis has no voice at all, even though his script is still shown on the CC. (DVD has no english subtitles, but the TV's captions work). He can be heard if it is switched to the Spanish or French audio track, but not in English 
 Am I the only one who in reading the reflections section began to feel that I had dropped in on the last days of the semester of a political science class and was therefore somewhat lost by many of the references? I actually majored in political science as an undergrad, but that was 20 some years ago. I don't remember what it means when you say Hegelian. And the fact that I remember studying Hegel puts me a slight advantage over let's say, biology majors. A sentence or two defining his terms would have helped a lot. I ended up just putting the book down with only 10-15 pages left. I never do that.  So, while parts of the reflection section were over my head, the insipid celebrity chasing of the bulk of the book was so condescending. Did Levy or the editors feel that we need to read about famous people, otherwise we are bored? In fact, it is the opposite. I really don't care that Woody Allen likes to play clarinet. He didn't tell us what we don't already know about these people. Or what we care about.  
 I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the Playstation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun, and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails. What they didn't say was that it's almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller, which is what you really need to do. For anything but shooting, all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour's play time, I had to take a break to rest my aching joints.  In case you haven't seen it, the G-Con2 gun has a teeny-weeny directional pad on the back of it, and it's this that you are expected to use to move yourself around. Now, if you try holding the gun in a standard "aiming" style, you'll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it. You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it, but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs. And they don't sit still waiting to be shot! So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time. And guess what? It's impossible. Bravo, Capcom. Oh, sorry, they didn't stop there, but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe. To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad, along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time. And be able to pull the trigger. But even that's the end of it - if you want still more pain, try using sniper mode!   As you may have realised, the control scheme completely spoiled the gameplay for me. I'm not fumble-handed by any means, but you would need to be an octopus to manage all this. Which is a shame, because a free-roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea. And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well. The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive. Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle, which means you don't have to worry about movement at all - hooray! The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T-Rex are probably the most fun in the game. The rest is ruined by the controls, which make your life hell. I'll tell you something else too - most levels have a TIME LIMIT!! In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers, this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero - so if you don't rush through the stage, it's game over for you. Kind of negates the joy of free-roaming, doesn't it? You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B, killing everything that moves...might as well be on rails. I don't know why this stupid condition was added, as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game.  It's a real waste of potential, but it's only fitting that Dino Stalker was a miserable failure after release. If you buy it, you have only yourself to blame. I managed to finish it - the final stage in the volcanic pit was actually pretty good fun, but this and the other bosses towards the end were endurance tests that caused me agonising hand cramps to get through. Save yourself - I made it through so that I could come here and tell you that you don't have to. Could have been a great game, but it all went wrong due to the impossible way you are expected to be able to use the gun. 
 This album exemplifies the relentless self-absorption and boredom of performance art.  I would never voluntarily buy anything else produced by this man.  It is artless, stupid and monotonic.  Did I forget to mention self-pitying and annoying?  If you want to ruin your day, buy this CD and listen to it first thing in the morning 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 Okay I admit, they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends. Heres my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera, most of the scenes were blurry, every now and again the focus was clear, I mean c'mon, when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing.Okay enough of that, now for the pros of the film. The make-up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince, the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel. Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds, at least you can say you saw it. Rent if you can, if not, buy used 
 This book is a nihilistic, incoherent work, and I dare anyone who reads this review to argue to the contrary.  Admiration for this book is humbuggery in action.  The emperor has no clothes 
 This is one of the worst children's games I ever played.  There are caterpillars to move around, but they don't really go anywhere, and it's so simple that even my 3 year old is completely bored with it.  Buy any other game but this one 
 congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades 
 Another Christian who think that liberal platitudes straight out of The New Republic are some how mandated by the faith.  Too bad 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility.  As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world.  These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom.  Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is.  At least truth in advertising is in effect here 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 I always find it amazing and ironic that there are textbooks teaching you how to think for yourself.  A bit ironic, don't you think? 
 This would be an excellent and thorough book were it not nine years old. The information on cost of living is useless because so much has changed 
 Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).  Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same. The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book. This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore 
 Firstly, it took two poeple to write this uninspiring book? Nowhere on the back does it state this is a Christian Chick Lit book.   Basically I cannot finish this book because the character is such a dork. One of the authors graduated from Baylor, so that explains the Christian theme, but come on! Drinking is not a sin! I guess my Catholic alcohol infused upbringng just can't relate to teetotaling Baptist types. I'll pass, now hand me a glass of wine... I'm moving on to read Smashed instead 
 The higher than average rating on the All Music Guide should have given me a clue; after all, the rock critic mafia only bestows high marks on uncompromising (read unmelodic) work, eschewing the hits that we mere mortals seem to enjoy.  Dancing about architecture, anyone?  I cannot recall a single memorable tune on this album which, aside from that Gothic Archies EP/coaster, is the only Merritt album I have ever returned.  One or two listens is all it takes to discern magic from tedium.  I left Eban & Charley at the listening post, won't even touch Pieces of April and am now officially worried about 'I'.  Has the well run dry 
 Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings "Lips of an Angel" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus!  
 Having lived in Istanbul for 4 years, I was more interested in finding out more about the Byzantium history since the rest of it (post 1453); I have studied immensely through out my school years. Unfortunately, Freely did not exceed or even meet my expectations, the book was more like a tourist guide and from what I gather from the reviews, most of the people who gave it a good rating are foreigners who went to Istanbul for vacation and sightseeing..  The historical facts consist mostly of some dates and mere numbers regarding population, mosques and some prominent sultans. There was no satisfactory story telling about the life outside the palace in which it is claimed that 26 different ethnicities were living side by side. Commoners, gypsies, peasants, jugglers, tumblers, thieves, dwarves, horses, elephants were some of the inhabitants that gave Istanbul her true color.  As in several books written with a similar approach, the "harem" in the Topkapi Palace is a whole chapter by itself, yet, the entire chapter is devoted to totally irrelevant history of such and such sultan died and the son became the new sultan and then he was replaced by the next one and so on...  The only plus in this book are the sketches of some arthictectural marvels in the last pages which you do not have to buy the book to be fascinated!  
 Love is blind, so they say.  Love is also deaf, judging from the reviews I read before purchasing this record. His debut was a masterpiece, the best album I ever bought. I'll always buy his new album as I know how talented Gough is, the brilliance he's capable of displaying.  One Plus One Is One is a semi back to basics record, an attempt to return to the beauty and simplicity of Hour of the Bewilderbeast, while still retaining the production values of Fed the Fish.  Gough has always been a quirky and eccentric artist, but that used to lend to his genius. On this album I find it hard to listen to some of the tracks without cringing: Year of the Rat (chorus), Holy Grail (children's choir), The Blossoms (that bloody flute), and these are just off the top of my head. The thing is though, if you take away the more over the top aspects of this record, this could have been an excellent album.   Many of the tracks seem to have a formulaic passage of flute and piano together, meandering away, going nowhere in particular and not particularly pleasing on the ear.  It sounds uninspired, insincere, and all the more disappointing for the promise shown at some point on nearly every track. Unfortunately there's always something that spoils it. Some may find 1+1=1 cute and endearing but I find it contrived and kitsch.            Having said that, it's a vast improvement from the self abusing guitar solo's and over production of his previous effort.  But from such a talented artist, I expect more. And so should you. 
 This is a deep and complex book. And unless you're really committed I wouldn't reccomend getting into this. 
 This book is great if you have one of the old machines that non one seels any more, but it's worthless forthe owner of a new TiVo. The author obviously knows what he's talking aboiut, but it doesn't matter any more. I sent this back and bought the Von Hagen book, which had the Series @ and tall of the old Series 1 info 
 I received this in Christmas, the 2nd time I cooked pork chop with it (the type with bones attached), I washed it right after I cooked the food, scratches were found. I never used any utensils to scratch it. I couldn't believe any wok would easily scratch like this one. It's a piece of junk. The bonus bamboo streamer is useless really. The only thing in that set I think is the most reliable is the bamboo spatula. 
 I waste my time to read this book which I borrowed from library. Anyone who trade more than six months will find nothing valuable in the book. I am surprised that John Wiley & Sons, which has a lot good books on trading and finace,  would publish this book 
 I like Sissy and Marissa but holy cow, this movie moved at a snails pace. I almost fell asleep waiting for the gun shot.  The story is so typical girl with two kids looking for some sap to help her out so she picks a naive high school grad.  pulls some smooth sex moves on the poor kid and gets his pee-pee all in a whirl and he becomes king kong and wants to protect her from her "horrible" estranged hubby, and play daddy to her brats. Its a no win situation, legally he's an "adult" so mom and dad can't forbid him from diddling with the tramp and unfortunatly he's in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets killed for no good reason.  And she ends up going back to her estranged hubbby and thinks what he did to get her back was soooo romantic.  The world is full of dumb c--ts and even dumber men.  Don't bother with this one 
 I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review.  This book was "recommended" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read.  The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her.  It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading.  This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people?  I agree that whatever "splash" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters.  It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting 
 Writers like Arundhati Roy love to write about conflicts.... the left in general loves the idea of a class struggle... because that is how the society in the West was for many years and still is in certain ways.. India has never been about that.. what one sees in India at every turn is reconciliation.. the amazingly accommodating nature of India enabling us to accept people from all religions, from all backgrounds etc. I believe that the essential nature of India is love... sadly, very few people recognize this and this book is the result.. shallow and abusive... We no longer seem to have the awe and respect for beauty and greatness... the "everyone and everything is equal" philosophy has destroyed our understanding of the world.  As Adi Shankara says, we are all equal but only when our mind evolves to the stage where we can conceive of the world in that fashion.  A materialistic loony who has plastic surgery every six months is not equal to Adi Shankara no matter what anyone might say.  As they say in my hometown,  Kahan Raja Bhoj, Kahan Gangoo Telli 
 Based on the reviews of this book I decided to buy it! To my absolute shock, I dont understand who wrote these great reviews??? They were probably written by the publisher or author of this book. What a waste of time and money. Being a designer myself, i ve got every possible book on interior design, and furniture styles that are out on the market. Based on the price of this book, and good reveiws, I figured it would be a great addition to my collection of books and references. Its poorly printed, very bad paper quality, no detailed shots of the furniture pieces, and not worth the price whatsoever. I mean if the publisher is charging this price, then the least they could do is print it on good paper and have clearer pictures. I am extremely dissapointed and returning the book asap. If u enjoy throwing your money away on a small book with poorly printed pictures(aside from the info, which is fine)then this is the book to buy . But if you are looking for details of furniture, including the background and history, and worth every penny, then i suggest you buy (Furniture: World Styles From Classical to Contemporary by Judith Miller  
 This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.  
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 I don't even understand why Peter Heller wrote this book. First of all, his descriptive skills are awful. How he could fail to give the reader a sense of what the Gorge is really like is beyond me. Ian Baker's book does a much better job. Secondly, he was a hack commercial journalist scabbing along on a legendary expedition. I give him credit for pulling no punches regarding the kayakers' feelings about him. After slogging through this underwhelming book, I bought the DVD that the kayakers shot. Much more bang for the buck. Peter Heller needs to learn a lesson that my 7th grade English teacher taught me: Show me, don't tell me 
 This book was completely not what I expected. I am a Senior in High School and I was a part of a reading group for class that chose to read this book and we were all very suprised at what the book turned out to be. We expected to read a book that wasn't all just about sexual urges and fantasies. This book had almost no purpose to it and appeared to only be written porn. I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 The author has provided a fascinating look at history and has nicely integrated sexuality and spirituality.  She also makes excellent points that reflect both the problems and solutions of today's culture.   Unfortunately, her premise is based upon the sacred prostitute as an ideal  archetype of the feminine essence, which limits the value and capacity of  the feminine to her willingness to prostitute herself, sacred or not.  The  author forms words like a feminist, but I'm hard-pressed to believe that  true feminism would attempt to narrow the female potential to a role of  simply beauty, sensuality, and a single-minded willingness to please the  male. I'm afraid the author's enthusiasm for her concept has blinded her to  the limitations of the sacred prostitute as an adequate archetype to  express the multifacetted potential of the feminine spirit 
 I am very disappointed in this purchase.  The only reason that I bought this book was to receive the NEW Scantron test!  The Scantron test that arrived with the book was the OLD test.  All information at the Amazon site said that the new test was included.  That information was in error 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 Redcoats is a book for the historian or academician but not the general reader. Brumwell has one point to make, more or less, that the English soldier in North America adapted to the style of fighting needed during the French-Indian War and was effective. This does not require an entire book and does not make for an interesting one. Every page contains several footnotes which usually don't explain anything further and could better be placed at the end. I had to work to finish the book. But possibly I'm being unfair in that I was looking for a book to build on my understanding of the war and not such an esoteric treatment of one part of it 
 What Prince made so special in the 80ties was his abbillity to create innovative music and at the same time appeal to a big audience. Diamond and Pearls appealed to the crowd, considering the 2 million copies it saled, but there is nothing new or exiting to be found on it. Prince even becomes a trendfollower by introducing rap in his music (Jughead) And offcourse there is "Gett off", a nice funk tune, but like all tracks on this cd, very mainstream. Many of the singles that were pulled from this album became great hits (Diamonds and Pearls, Cream, Money Don't Matter 2Night), but they are also amoungst his most uneventfull songs. It shows that being a commercial hit does not equal quality. Only "Willing and Able" and "Strollin'" are showing a tiny glimpse of Prince's true talent and his willingness to experiment with his music. Prince made over 30 albums in his career (I'm proud owner of all of them) and I'm sorry to say this album belongs in the bottomhalf of his catalogue. It was one of his biggest commercial successes and the album sold millions of coppies, but it is also very "middle of the road". It misses spontanity and originality. What is left is a well produced R&B album (perhaps even overproduced), with a handfull of good songs. But non will leave a lasting impression or define Prince's talent. If you seek to be introduced to Prince music get Purple Rain, Sign Of The Times or Lovesexy instead.   
 It is amazing that a writer with the skill to craft Hyperion, after that crafts a book like Ilium and Olympus.  The good thing about Ilium and Olympus is the amount of ideas mr. Simmons has in his story. Combining Homer's Iliad with literary robots from Jupiter and 'Gods' on Mars' Olympos that use quantum and nanotechnology, what could be cooler? Even in his worst books Simmons has more ideas, literature and vivid imagination than most average science fiction writers have in their life.   However, the execution of this book is plain horrific, especially with Hyperion in my mind, that that in my opinion is one of the best science fiction books ever written. The biggest problem in my regard is the lack of motive. Characters in the book just have no motive to do the things they do.   * Spoiler alert *  Some examples of events for which no motives is given.  - Professor Hockenberry stays with the Greek troops while they are loosing, he can be hit and die every minute, they don't like him or accept him and he can choose to teleport and have sex with the most beautiful woman of earth. Why did he want to stay?  - Why did Prospero send Harman on a senseless thousands mile walk when his race badly needed him. Just for the submarine, after which he almost died and about which he could do nothing?  - Why did the evil monsters with almost eternal power that even could wreck the whole solar system just go away, even without putting up a fight. "Because it was rumored that the silent one was comming"? Give me a break.  - Why was Ilium transported to the future?  - Why was Moira revived and why did she ever went to sleep anyway? She could virtually live forever with the hospitums and she didn't need a body anyway. Again no reason.  - Why did Setebos remove all humans from the old earth and put them in a tachyon beam in current earth?  - Why, after aeons of their lifestiles do Harman and Ada want to start a family and suddenly have current day ethics?  - Why would robots be programmed to love poetry and need centuries for studying only one writer.   * End Spoiler Alert *  Besides not having motives the characters are very shallow. You have no idea what goes on in the mind of the Gods or in the heroes like Achilles. They never feel fear, nor are enthusiastic about anything. They just do stuff because they do or because it is written by Homer. All the Gods act the same, all the "ancient" people act the same, all the "new" people except for a mild variation Harman act the same.   Furthermore, there is no real danger. Mr. Simmons fell into the trap of putting lead characters in infinite danger, but always be saved in the last second. Yuck.   Then there is the issue of style. To make future beings probable they talk this pseudo-science all the time. Sentences are filled with "nano", "quantum", "brane" so much that it is clear that mr. Simmons tries to show off that he knows something about these scientific concepts. While I have the feeling he doesn't, really. Furthermore, these beings communicate with others of which they know they cannot know anything about these concepts, but just keep on talking the same way. And all characters do that. Plain ridiculous.   Also the literary reference, Simmon's trademark, is done really badly here. The references (mostly Shakespeare) go nowhere, he even throws in a mediocre poem of his wife. It all seems very forced and totally irrelevant. What a shame.  And don't let me even start on the anti-Islam and anti-gay references that come out of nowhere. Why?!?  To conclude, I really cannot recommend this book. If you just want to be shortly amused and don't care about quality you can read it. If you want to read some good science fiction I'd recommend to read Hyperion and possibly Endymion from the same writer. Those are terrific, great, splendid. The Ilium / Olympos is unworthy to be even in those books' shadow.  Please, PLEASE, mr. Simmons, start writing high quality Science Fiction again 
 I bought this because my two and half year old nephew has enjoyed Hola Jalapeno for many months and I thought I'd try something new.  He loves to be read to but this one just won't keep his interest.  I'll keep trying.  Maybe when he's a bit older 
 Breton and Villegas make the case that Latin ballplayers are exploited and then, in the overwhelming majority of cases, tossed away by major league teams.  Miguel Tejada was one of those who, it turned out, wasn't just  cheap filler for an organization's minor league chain, but instead broke  through to the majors.  This surprised the A's organization which  originally ranked him below other Dominicans who have since faded and  returned to island obscurity or the life of an undocumented alien in New  York City.  Unfortunately, the author's case is buried by some truly  stilted prose in a narrative that wanders all over the map without giving  Tejada himself much more life in the book than as a paradigm for the  author's argument.  I happen to know already a fair amount about Latin  ballplayers so this book brought me neither increased insight into them as  a group or to Tejada as an individual 
 These earings were ok quality,but were really small.  They would be better suited for a child 
 If you've looked at this book and you think it's complete - you're right - it's completely wrong.  Many of the songs have incorrect tab and chord listings.  I have compared many of the songs in the book to how Harrison plays them in the Concert for Bangladesh and the chords are definitely wrong. If you're looking for George Harrison guitar tablature that is correct don't buy this one 
 I also saw this on Oprah and was excited. Was a let down...I was hoping it would be more Christian based and not so superficial.  I would recommend "300 Questions Every LDS Couple Should Ask Before Marriage-- Alder.  It's for mormons but most of the questions are christian based if your looking for something with that slant 
 This book has some very good advice about knowing when to speak up and knowing when to be silent when your daughter is expressing herself.  It is also frought with some very bad advice about allowing "experimentation" in your daughters life.  I was confused about how one section deals with teaching girls that their self worth is not tied up in their bodies, then giving dads the advice to allow a daughter to wear provocative clothing.  I quote, "wearing sexy clothing is a normal adolescent behavior".  Some daughters might be all the better for allowing boys to ogle them, but mine better keep the receipt.  I say no thank you to most of the advice given in this book.  Dad isn't meant to be a passive listener and enabler.  Sometimes, Dad is supposed to put his foot down and say that some things are unnacceptable 
 One here should pay attention to the fact that out of 224 pages only about 88 pages were authored by Livermore, the remaining part is Richard Smitten's commentary.   Livermore wrote seven chapters:   "Challenge of Speculation", "When Does a Stock Act Right?", "Follow the Leaders", "Money in the Hand", "The Pivotal Point", "The Million Dollar Blunder", "Three Million Dollar Profit" and Appendix: "The Secret Market Key". These chapters are an interesting read, more of a general, anecdotal trading advice than anything dangerously or revealingly specific; more of a reflection than a battle song. Then again, why would a "loner, famously tight-lipped operator" would wanna make you an animal on Wall Street? At the very core of Livermore's trading strategy was the "Pivotal Point" (trend reversal). All his trading (whether it was short or long) boiled down to the recognition and timed entry or exit at the Pivotal Point . The problem is that you will have to accept only the following explanation as to what the Pivotal Point is: "A change in basic market direction- the perfect psychological time at the beginning of a new move. It is a major change in the basic trend." There is no calculation, algorithm, further delineation given, you get a nice, tidy, utterly useless definition. Clearly, you are not gonna make millions with this "secret".  As for the "Secret Key": it is a written form of simply recorded prices. Livermore was not a "chartist", so he scribbled pages after pages filled with prices arranged in six columns. Here a look at the simplest chart worth 30 odd pages of scribbles. Surely it is easier to see resistance, support, trend reversal graphically, then following columns of numbers.   Richard Smitten wrote the "Commentary":  This part is a mixed bag. He is using a more useful and structured description of the Livermore method, using highlights, current stock charts and quotes. For awhile you truly appreciate his efforts. But when he ends up repeating the very same things an average of FIVE times, advertising his future book (with "Current Reviews"!) and website, you will start having the uneasy feeling about being cheated and your reading time abused. The same goes for the pictures of Livermore and his family; while they are interesting, they have nothing to do with titled purpose of the book. (Why did Mrs. Livermore shoot poor lil' Jesse? Why did Jesse shoot the dog? Oh, well, please read my next book on these... 
 The most painfully slow book I've read in years.  I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour.  The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written.  The major subplots are "what's for dinner tonight," and "what will the plumber work on next."  The dialogue is artificial and irritating.  It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories.  Using words like "modicum" and "greasy spoon" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.  I want my $7.00 back 
      After using Dr.Dyer's aaah meditation CD for a month, I decided that I wanted to learn more this meditation. Therefore, I bought the book Manifest Your Destiny.  The book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  There are many things that disturb me about this book.        Dr. Dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  One of the bible quotes he uses is "Is it not written in your law `I have said, You are gods?'" (John 10:34)  This is the passage to which Jesus referred when He said this to the Pharisees who were attempting to charge Him with blasphemy: " God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? ... I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High."  (Psalms 82:1,2,6). The unjust judges of Israel (i.e., the Pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  They were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Dr. Dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   Scripture cannot be broken.        Jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are God's other laws.  A true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure God's Word for his own purpose.  Neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about God's Word and actually expect to know God's and come into a relationship with Him.  Dr. Dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. The fact of the matter is that according to Jesus the door to God's kingdom is narrow (Luke 13:24).   There are no shortcuts.       Lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  This appears to be a main theme of Dr. Dyer's book.  Those who seek God first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a "gift" from Him.  We do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust God and put Him first in our lives.  Dr. Dyer seems to miss the point. 
 In this recording, Janos Starker proves what true musicians around the globe already know: technique is definitely not everything.  These performances are so bland and dry, but you'll never hear him make a mistake.  I'd really rather listen to someone who plays with expression but who makes little errors anyday over Janos.  I know he's really highly esteemed in the cello world, but he really oughtta stay away from Baroque.  These performances are about as gripping as a Slip-`N-Slide.  Add to it that he plays all the music like it's Ravel or Brahms (i like both of them, but way different style); the vibrato machine is constantly on - TURN IT OFF! ARE YOU TRYING TO SOUND LIKE A BEL CANTO OPERA SINGER?, tuning is A440, clanky bright PIANO for accompaniment, no one playing continuo - the guy OBVIOUSLY doesn't give a flying fig about authenticity, or the composer's intentions.  To sum it up, if you want a recording that sounds like the Suzuki Cello School tapes with way less expression and an even hokier sounding piano, buy this recording.  Everyone else, beware 
 I'm not a big fan of the Apostle Paul in many ways, though I've come to value him and his works more highly in the last decade.  It is clear to any student of church history that Paul and the people he trained and taught, and his followers, are the primary reason that Christianity is a major Western religion today.  It is more than likely that without Paul, Christianity would have remained a small offshoot of Judaism for centuries and might never have flowered as it did.  And Cannon makes this clear.  But I found the book very disappointing.  Starting with a highly imaginative history of Paul's life before he became a scholar in Judaism and an arm of the Temple, Cannon has him attending Greek schools of philosophy, and thoroughly enjoying a wide range of female companionship.  When Cannon sends Paul to Jerusalem, it comes about because of the machinations of his mother in a struggle with his father over Paul's future.  (His father being a tentmaker and merchant, who taught Paul the tentmaking by which he earned his bread later in life.)  In Jerusalem, a lot of time is spent on Paul's efforts to become someone important in the Temple, leading to the stoning and martyrdom of Stephen.  Paul's journey to Emmaus is a result of his further political machinations.   Cannon's descriptions of Paul's thinking about faith and God are rather matter-of-fact, very logical, and rather pedestrian.     While Cannon does describe the miracle on that journey to Emmaus, and Paul joining the Christian community, much of the book is taken up with Paul's alleged political struggles in the early church against Peter and James, whom Cannon calls the "Judaizers".  While Cannon rightly attributes the taking of the message to the Gentiles to Paul, he spends what I think an inordinate number of pages dwelling on what he says are the internal political struggles of the early church, especially whether Gentiles should be required to follow Jewish laws.  Cannon attributes the victory of non-Judaizers over the Judaizers entirely to Paul.  He never mentions Peter's vision of the animals being let down in the net, which was, in scripture, God's way of telling Peter that Gentiles did not need to follow Jewish law (or be circumcised, which was the really big sticking point for Gentile converts).  In scripture, this is a major event, and in scripture, as a result of his vision, Peter changed his thinking entirely over the conversion of and welcome to Gentiles, but Cannon doesn't give that vision even one word.  In spending so much time on these internal political battles (which may or may not have occurred), Cannon leaves little space for faith, awe and wonder.  I would not recommend this book. 
 While the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written, I found the story itself uninteresting and sexist.  I would not recommend this book. 
 A bunch of great guitarists dealing with John Coltrane's complex harmonies. Quite every jazz player considers Coltrane as one of the most rappresentative and influential musician in the world; I love all the musicians playing in this album, they all have the harmony knowledge to play on the intricate Coltrane's chord changes, BUT...it seems they never listened to his songs, to his sounds, to the magic athmosphere he was able to create on his albums. That dreamy sensation is the main thing lacking here in my opinion. Playing in a Coltrane tribute is NOT ONLY playing over Coltrane chords! Here it's like  some good guitar players practising...where's the Tribute?? Besides, in Giant Steps (soloist: Greh Howe) why mix a kind of Hendrix's Foxy Lady in the main theme??? I would have expected something more, considering skill of such guitarsits.  Maybe a too commercial project 
 The authors skillfully elide several hundred words in the midst of their selection from Thomas Jefferson's "Notes on the State of Virginia" in a fashion that substantially alters the text. Anyone who is determined to use this book as an instructional work would do well to carefully examine the contents before making a final decision 
 The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" & "Fanny & Alexander," von Trier's "The Kingdom," Fassbinder's "Berlin Alexanderplatz," Kusturica's "Underground," and Petersen's "Das Boot," The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making "issue films," but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.   This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price 
 "Mao had done 2 things that mattered, he said. He had battled Chiang Kaishek for years and finally chased him off to that little island of Taiwan. And in the long war of resistance he had asked the Japanese to return to their ancestral home and had fought his way into the Forbidden City." Mao also (once he had the influence to do so) helped old acquaintances get local party jobs and was a writer of sorts, as well as an avid reader (of what God only knows as he obviously didn't seem to learn much from all the supposedly scholarly books he is said to have consumed). Mao's writings, however, left much to be desired, even in Mao's own opinion. When Stalin asked him in 1950 which of Mao's writings ought be published in Russia Mao demurred, responding that his works published by local publishing houses in China contained "a mass of errors and misrepresentations" & needed further review first. Stalin was no great theorist either, of course, but it seems that the author of this book has swallowed a helping of Stalin's own progranda regarding such issues. Hence Stalin not only gets most of the credit for supporting Chinese Communists (through the Soviet controlled Communist International), but is further credited with being a "founding father of the Soviet Revolution" (notwithstanding this to be a gross exaggeration on 2 fronts: 1---that he wasn't that involved & 2---that it was no revolution even, but a coup d'etat actually). And while Stalin's early collectivization drive did cause "widespread suffering" in the author's characterization he seems to think that the reason for this was that "many officials moved to fast." Interestingly, this is the only (albeit indirect) mention by the author of Stalin's self-inflicted famine while the author pointedly relates how Mao's version (particularly between 1960-61) cost at least 20 million lives. And last, but not least, the author informs us that Stalin was "the guide and inspiration to his people in the terrible years of the German invasion." You get the point now? On other "fronts:" The Korean War was induced by Stalin & wound up because of his death so that this subject is all but ignored in this book is not so surprising either. Likewise, Khrushchev & Mao's sparring contest leading to the Sino-Soviet rift, and armed clashes between their countries in 1969 is also ignored. Also ignored in this admittedly slim book is how Mao went from being a nobody to leading the Chinese Communist Party. Apparently such issues as these are too pregnant with inconvenient history or are not particularly interesting to Mr. Spence; who instead dispenses with heck of a lot of ink regaling us with details of Mao's family life---4 marriages resulting in 10 births. So we learn such important stuff as which child studied where or who of the 10 survived into adulthood. We are also treated to a litany of people that Mao could have gotten more accurate information from, but didn't, as he became more and more "divorced from reality"; as if Mao & his entourage had little clue what was really going on in the country. Yeah, that's what happened. Sometimes it's worth reading such a slim volume as this one; for instance, to get an idea of the story before moving on to more substancial works, but regarding this book I suggest you attempt a more coherent work instead and ignore Mr. Spence's "Mao." (Aside: I read and reviewed this book while in China myself.) Cheers!  
 "Nuclear Axis" is the third book by this author (a British missile engineer) on the theme of Axis secret weapons.  Henshall began his research by visiting the remains of German missile bases in Northern France, but more recently has employed more traditional archival sources (e.g. ENIGMA decrypts).  His general themes are 1) that the German V-weapons were originally intended for nuclear payloads; 2) both Germany and Japan were more advanced in nuclear weapons research than orthodox history allows; 3) that there was a high level of cooperation between the German and Japanese programs.  These are radical views indeed, demanding hard evidence to back them up.  That evidence is just not there.  Henshall actually retracts some of the most interesting claims in his earlier books (e.g. his "missile silos" west of Cherbourg turn out to be unfinished emplacements for old battleship guns!).  The new evidence in this book is ambiguous at best.  For instance, decoded messages show that the Japanese requested shipments of zirconium and beryllium from Germany.  Henshall goes on at length about the uses of these elements in nuclear bombs and reactors, but never explores the non-nuclear uses they might have had in 1945.  There is no evidence of the large facilities that would have been necessary for any serious A-bomb program anywhere in Germany or Japan.  Finally, in the real world, there is no evidence for real collaboration between the four known Axis nuclear weapon programs (German Army, German Post Office, Japanese Army, and Japanese Navy).  In totalitarian states, the political power to be gained by producing the magic weapon was too tempting to the various empire-builders for the kind of collaboration Henshall posits.  I only gave the book two stars because it does have some interesting drawings of V-weapon bases that are hard to find today.  For a serious academic study of the V-weapons, find a copy of Dieter Holsken's "V-Missiles of the Third Reich" 
 I use to think it was a cool movie when I first saw it a few times but then I started to get sick of it. The kids in the movie started to get noisy and annoying and I just wanted to turn off the TV. It's not a bad movie but it comes on HBO every once in awhile and that what gets annoying about it. 
 So, before the other reviewers jump all over me and accuse me of all manner of personal deficiencies, let me state for the record that I am over 40, remember the Cold War very clearly, am not a PC leftist, and am perfectly capable of enjoying wacky farce.  That said, this movie just didn't work for me. The premise was good, but the jokes were only occasionally funny - most of them were lazy and feeble and just fell flat. And except for Cagney, the actors were too shrill and strident. Everyone was straining SO HARD to get it across that "Hey, folks, this is REALLY FUNNY STUFF here, can't you see us sweat?" Comedy needs to appear effortless. This movie is wearisome.  Okay, let the motive-sniffing and ad hominem remarks begin 
 I rented this movie at blockbuster when I thought it would be good but it sucked. I mean i bought the foreigner and that sucked as well. This movie was barely advertised he just comes up with more and more crap to sell. His older movies rocked meanwhile, this movie sucked out loud 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 'Mimic Sentimel' is the result of mixing two kind of films -- look how Marvin, a patient confined in a room, watching through a camera the people living in the opposite apartment, AND how he gets invloved with a series of death by the killing human-bugs.  While spending time taking photos of the outside, Marvin and his sister Rosie come to think they have witnessed a murder, and call the police.  The standard plot device means that the cop would not believe in the story, or at least remain sceptical, and the thrill continues.  In this movie, inspted of that, the cop starts to have a date with Marvin's mom (Amanda Plummer).  Do you think we need this kind of plot development?  Anyway, after while the story strays into the alley, another girl comes into the room, named Carmen, and the two become Nancy Drew-like amateur detectives, and there is a strange man nicknamed 'The Garbageman' (Lance Henriksen, 'AVP' and many others).  But you don't see Grace Kelly here, nor Hitchcock's assured hand as director.  The film suffers from a very disjointed script, which doesn't know how to scare, or even amuse us.  The bad construction of the filmed shots only lead to the confused impression on our side -- actually, we don't know exactly whether some of the characters are killed or not, or how got killed.  The bad acting from the leads only lessen the scare, and first of all, you don't see the lethal bug itself very much.  The only good thing is the photography that captured the creepy mood of the backyard of a decayed apartment.  But the film is another disappointment from Dimention Films that once gave us 'Scream.'  And someone please send e-mail address of Tarantino to Amanda Plummer, who was in the epoch-making 'Pulp Fiction.' (You remember that terrific diner scene, don't you?)              
 I was disapointed by this book. The author ideas are very intersting and deserve 5 stars. However, every chapter starts with very few pages of text then continues with a copy/past of NTSB reports. The book has about 500 pages more than 400 arn't original work but just publicly available accident reports 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 SUMMARY: Film Students are making a movie called Urban Legends, and when they start working, they all start getting killed off one by one.  IN MY OPINION: I HATED THIS MOVIE! This movie rips off alot of horror movies such as Scream 3. This is John Ottman's debut and in my opinion he ruined his career with this peice of junk. I liked the original, I thought it was awesome, but this movie talks about making a horror movie instead of Urban Legends. Oh yeah, I don't mean to spoil it for you guys who are gonna watch it, but this is a movie in a movie which is so stupid. Oh yeah, and Jennifer Morrison sucks in her role, but there is good acting. But either way the movie is not good.  OVERALL: I warn you, if your still gonna watch it. Some people do like this movie, and you might too, but if your a horror movie lover, you'd be disapointed with the horrifyingly bad sequel to the B+ original.   Sincerly, J 
 This is a new low, even for our feminazi-drenched anti-culture.  The whole message of this whore of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being superficial, arrogant, shallow and slutty are positive attributes, desirable & healthy, and that by contrast, having true strength of character, integrity, honor and modesty are for 'losers.'  In other words, looking and behaving like a skank tramp = "empowerment."  That term has been SO misued over the last 30 years (and particularly the last 10), that it ceases to have any truth to it whatsoever.  Barbie used to epitomize what it meant to be feminine, a lady, and fulfilled -- with a husband, a home and children.  Now that standard has been completely perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this -- exchanging true values (being a good wife and mother) for false ones (materialism and promiscuity).  Even Barbie's face has been uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner and collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out Bratz dolls.  Realize -- this is a WAR on our children's souls!  Mattel should be ashamed of themselves, to the hilt.  This is child abuse, pure and simple.  Any mother who allows their child to get one of these monstrosities should be jailed for neglect and have her tubes tied 
 I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it. I own ALL of them, and so when I stood in line all night Saturday (and through Sunday morning, 8am), I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB: Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii. I bought an entire set of controllers, anticipating the mini-game fun with all my friends. (We're huge SMB fans, all of us. It always makes an appearance at our parties.)  But now I'm really angry. They completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s), hitting Monkey Target worst of all. I can honestly say I don't care that there are 50 freakin mini-games, because now Monkey Target is completely worthless. Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items, increasingly difficult levels, magnets, velcro, double bonuses, wind speed and direction, and the all-import ramp run-off you have... a cannon, one level, no wind or wind direction, no bonuses, and no special items.  Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level? Monkey squash -- no joy there. A lot of the controls for the mini-games are terrible. And so on, so forth. The new mini games suck almost unilaterally, but gosh darn, there are 50 of them! But volume does not make up for lack of quality.  I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB: Banana Blitz are nice. The graphics are beautiful and fun. But the best part of the game for me and my friends, is now gone and dead. None of the reviews I'd read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this, and if they had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $50 plus tax.  If Sega people are reading this: BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET. That's what people play at parties when they're slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers, and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 When I ripped these CD's and put them on my computer and listened to them, my heart sank.    First, the sound is so incredibly loud, in comparison to other CD's, that one has turn down the stereo significantly to even carry on a conversation.  That led me to run the files through what is called a wave editor, which shows the digital files in a viewable format.  What I saw confirmed what I heard.  All the tracks were recorded at zero decibles, the maximum any digital sound file can have.  If it is louder than that, the sound is clipped and there can be modest to significant distortion.  I may be getting too technical for you guys, but in the old days we had a VU meter and the sound could crest into the red (above 0db) and be OK--not with digital music.  Above 0db, and the file portions are simply not heard.  80% of the music in each track file are at 0db.  To simplify this for you the quiet portions of each track and the louder portions of each track are compressed so each approaches or exceeds 0db.  What I saw were sounds tha instead of peaking or approaching 0db were well above that value.  So instead of a good zig zag file pattern, one sees a big blot of red.  When I went back and listened to the sections that were above 0db, you could hear noticeable clipping and distortion.  Lowering the volume using any digital sound editor certainly makes the CD set more listienable, but does not remove the distortion and clipping.  High compression mastering at 0db is now a mistake that some CD mastering plants are doing.  I'm not sure why.  Audioslave and Red hot chili peppers are two other examples of artists doing this to make the sound appear to be punchier.  From a sound standpoint, this set sucks.  Rip the Capitol vinyl versions or buy the Japanese versions, both of which will give you a more honest sound of the greatest rock group ever.  I am so disappointed in this set.  
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 "MacArthur's Undercover War" has all the makings of a great modern World War II book:  seldom heard-of commando raids in the Pacific, daring esponiage, and a larger-than-life character in the famous and controversial Douglas MacArthur.  Yet a few obvious errors and a lack of solid citations has left me to question a great deal of material in this book (as another reviewer warned.)  First off, for readers eager to dive into the MacArthur controversy, this book will be a disappointment.  Breuer has nothing but praise for MacArthur although he does acknowledge the commander's prima donna demeanor.  Indeed, you will not see in this book a citation of the "Dugout Doug" poem that was undoubtedly uttered by so many GIs on Corregidor and Bataan in 1942.  One error (or maybe a slip of the author's organization) in the book nearly caused my to shelve it without completing the work.  While discussing the early battles between Japanese-American forces, the author places the battle of Midway after the struggle on Guadalcanal! In reality, the great turning point at Midway occured in the summer of 1942, while the Guadalcanal battle wrapped up a year later in 1943. I was quite stunned upon reading Breuer's account of Midway, and I looked over the pages again to make certain that I did not skip any dates that the author inserted in the text.  There was none.  In the chapter titled "The Great Manila Bay Silver Heist,"  the last year mentioned before Breuer explains Midway is 1943.  Then Breuer continues onward to mention how the battle of Midway opened on June 7 without mentioning the year, seemingly implying to any reader that he is still discussing 1943.  In another error I noticed, Breuer describes the B-29 "Flying Fortress."  This again is misleading, since the B-17 was the official "Flying Fortress," while the mammoth B-29 was the "Super Fortress."  Such errors would certainly force any knowledgeable reader to question an author's credibility.  The good news is that "MacArthur's Undercover War" is an entertaining book; a great book for anyone looking for a "shoot 'em up" tale that may or may not be fiction.  For educational purposes, however, readers should look elsewhere 
 The typesetting makes this book unpleasant to read. However, it is the writing style that makes the reading a frustrating experience: The author throws you piles of technical terms without clearly explaining their meaning, or the relation to and difference from related acronyms. It might be a book for you only if you are already a telecom expert. Otherwise, you would probably find yourself in a similar situation to mine--hoping someone can help you with tons of questions you cannot find answers for from this book 
 Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen, Bernie Leadon, Steve Young, the Woodys and even Burrito Deluxe?  Seems that whoever compiled this recording chose to do the usual thing that Nashville unfortunately is so well-known for - ignore and delete the stellar contributions of those who helped to propel Americana music or Alt-Country, namely those California Country Rocking boys who influenced the Marty Stuarts, the Jim Lauderdales, Dwight Yoakams, and so many others - and who by the way are still recording today - yet have been left off this album.  Vince Gill and his Notorious Cherry Bombs contribute a song called "Wait A Minute" but it sure isn't the same song written by his old friend Herb Pedersen, who was instrumental in taking the young, former replacement for Craig Lee Fuller in Pure Prarie League one step further on the way to Country superstardom.  Shame on You! - gosh, you could have included Rascal Flats and no one would have noticed the difference.  Oh yeah, there's a Dirt Band recording here. Not complaining, but up until recently the Nittys made Nashville their home, not L.A., Bakersfield, or Woody Creek. But that doesn't explain why Steve Young ("Seven Bridges Road") or Bernie Leadon who do live in the "home" of "country" music were excluded.  REMEMBER KIDDIES - if it weren't for two albums - "Sweetheart of the Rodeo" by the McGuinn-Chris Hillman-Gram Parsons-Kevin Kelley Byrds or the Burritos wonderful first album "Gilded Palace of Sin" Americana or Alt-Country might never have gotten an audience. You'd never be hearing this kind of music, nor this album. Ralph Emery and the original Nashville purists had done their utmost to prevent Country Rock (the precursor of Americana music) from being a viable music force - and sadly, those today who should appreciate what Hillman, Parsons, Clarence White, Gene Clark, the Dirt Band and so many others did can only throw a bone to Jeff Hanna and company, and to Emmylou. Forget the rest, they're as ignored as if "Drug Store Truck Driving Man" Emery was still running the show.  
 these clubs are a waste of money.  The graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75.  My 8 iron broke the first time i hit it.  The bag is falling apart.  Save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs.  U can get some clone clubs that will last years and u'll play twice as better for just a tad more 
 I really wanted to like this book, but was immediately put off by Lisa's "holy-roller" mother trying to get Catholic girl Amy to sign a "statement of faith" to assure her salvation. Yikes!!  I could see where an ill-informed fundamentalist character would do this, but shame on "Amy" for leaving her Catholic roots and joining a "mega-church".  She could have found a deeper faith in the ancient Church instead of leaving it on what appears to be a whim!  After this, it was hard to like her character...I'm sure that the evangelical publisher would not have liked a main character remaining Catholic, but, sorry to inform some of you, it's the same Jesus that died on the Cross that we believe in too. We also worship the risen Christ, most just choose to display a Christ on the Cross as a reminder of how we got our redemption!  Robin, write a sequel where Amy gets involved in the Charismatic Catholic Renewel and that will re-establish her as a true French girl and a faith-filled Christian!  
 Horror fans,don't be fooled! Notice how most if not all the good reviews on this page are written by reviewers who only have one review in the catalog. That normally is a tell tale signal that it was reviewed by someone who was involved with making the film. That must be the case here because the movie I watched was so aweful that no armcheer reviewer in there right mind would give this piece of trash anything more than the one star they are forced to give here at amazon. This is the type of flick that makes any respectible horror fan cringe with anger & makes you wish that you had the little bit of money these folks had to make this mess 'cause anybody with half a brain and a chunk of imagination could have come up with somthing ten times better. There are plenty of backwoods horror films (both low-budget straight to dvd and big screen) that are light years better than this useless waste of time,$ and space. It isn't even a "SO BAD IT'S GOOD" goof-fest. This is just a sad insult to horror fans so don't be fooled by the phony good reviews. 
 It took a great deal of determination to finish but not any joy.  
 Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT.  as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'.  it's just an okay album 
 Mind you, I didn't buy this book, but I did give it a very thorough looking through during a two hour visit to Borders.  I went through this entire book, looking at the artists that I like, including R&B and a little bit of hip hop. I cannot speak for their reviews for other genres, but for the ones I read about the actual albums I own... the reviews are extremely flawed. Almost every review I read, I disagreed with.   Erykah Badu's album, Baduizm, was given a mere 3/5 stars. This album is now considered a classic, yet it is supposedly musically equivalent to Janet's 'Damita Jo' and worse than Toni Braxton's 'More Tha A Woman?!' And Erykah's terrible live album is also 3/5 stars? Jill Scott's classic albums are only considered 3 star material, too? TLC's 'Crazysexycool' is, too? Missy Elliott's best album is her first, 'Da Real World' is her worst and 'This Is Not A Test' is her second best?!!! I could go on and on...  It is nice to spark up conversation between your music buddies, I guess. The book is a very entertaining read and the writing/critiquing can be admired, but as far as using this as a guide for albums to buy and not buy... 2 thumbs down 
 I consider myself a high intermediate to low advanced exerciser. I was reading some of the reviews for this workout, and thought to give it a try. I was very dissapointed after doing it, because it did not challenge me at all. I had expected so much more from this routine, that I thought it is a kind of joke, when Ana Caban said she's done at the end. I would rather recommand the 10 Min. Solution Pilates with Lara Hudson. If you do the whole hour of this, then you really get a great workout. I hope I can sell this DVD soon. I would only recommand it to someone, who is at a beginner level with doing Pilates. It gives a good view of all the main pilates exercises 
 L&M were so much more than what this represents....and I won't even discuss the Angry Eyes issue. L&M were also more than a pop/radio group that I have seen mentioned here. They had many songs which featured more of a jazz feel. I would highly recommend you only buy their studio releases as there were not that many. A greatest hits release just does not do them justice 
 Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book.  The book is put together by gathering some data mining concepts padded with tons of buzzwords to "teach" you about data mining.  It really fails to teach you anything and it really succeeds to confuse the hell out of the reader.  The language used on this book is the poorest I have ever seen in my entire life.  The people how wrote this book and the publishers who published it should be ashamed of themselves.  It is a shame that I had to pay for this piece of work because I have to read it for a course I am taking and I really dread opening it every week.  
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 This is first Microsoft Press book that I can't recommend to anyone. The author is probably well versed in the technology but his ability to fully explain to the average reader is lacking. Chapter 2 should have expanded to explain the strength and weakness of each of the Authentication, Encryption, and Data Integrity processes. If you don't understand the security issues that each of these processes deals with you will be lost very quickly. Each Microsoft operating has different levels of support and setting for setting up a wireless client configuration - the book blows past this. I have found more information on the Cisco site 
 I thought I'd enjoy this humorous short story collection, but My Date with Satan read like an amateur comic routine at a comedy club.  The author tried too hard to be witty and clever at times and said attempts often backfired.  I rolled my eyes while I read this book more times than I care to remember.  The only story that I liked was "Rats Eat Cats."  That was the only story that had some earnest humor.  As an avid short-fiction reader, My Date with Satan lack the ingredients needed in this stuff genre to hook readers.  This book was not for me.. 
 the vocals on here are horrible, sounds like a cheap danzig impression. the music is ok but the lyrics are just as bad as the vocals, stupid lyrics like i wish i could make out with her. amy sue is a terrible song. this album would be alot better with a different vocalist and with different lyrics. dont waste your money on this. 
 I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-( 
 How are we supposed to feel at the end of this movie?  Good, that the Nigerian patients survived?  I don't think so.  The most important aspect of this story is really quite simple:  Lt. Waters disobeyed direct orders and sacrificed the lives of four SeALS.  More than $5,000,000 in assets lost because his character had an emotional crisis?  That's a steep price to pay.  In the really real world, a deserved court martial would be awaiting Lt. Waters upon his return home.  Besides all of this, the military tactics, or lack thereof, in this movie must have been 'developed' by a blind monkey.  JoJo the Idiot Circus Boy must have been the military consultant.  I can only hope that a sequel is made, with the end result being Lt. Waters hanging from a yard arm! 
  The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.   The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.   
 A brainless, predictable soap opera with some of the most laughably bad dialogue I have ever heard.  This is easily the most embarrasing "serious" film I have seen and is argued to be one of the worst films of all time (the film "won" several Razzies, including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay).  Adrian Lyne -- whose credits as a director alternate between the interesting and the unpleasant/sleazy -- directs this movie as if it were a shampoo commercial.  A woman (Demi Moore) and her whiny, annoying husband (Razzie recipient Woody Harrelson, who unfortunately disappoints) are in a state of financial crisis.  Because the couple is, well, spoiled and none-too-bright, they go to Las Vegas with the intention of winning money in order to buy their dream house.  Their plan fails, and I personally did not care because neither character is especially sympathetic.  Along comes Robert Redford, who offers them 1 million dollars in return for sex with Moore.  Then, the marriage collapses in emotional turmoil and numerous bad scenes play out (including a curious one in which a classroom of immigrants learning English from Moore miraculously understand English all of a sudden and laugh at a bunch of jokes told by Redford).   The story is trashy and sleazy, and there's not one sympathetic character in the bunch.  The seasoned Redford has some good moments, but even he cannot save the picture.  Overall, this is a Razzie "classic," to say the least, and it contains one of the most laughably bad lines I've ever heard in a film: "I really wanted you to have that hippo."  (note: If you are now wondering how a hippo ties into the film, I advise you to not bother giving it any thought) 
 My printing problems began two months after warranty expiration. I tried every troubleshoot I could find, three times. What a beautiful machine. It does everything very well. It even looks great sitting there on the desk. But what if it stops printing, then what good is it? I finally gave up and bought something else 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 This book is indeed passionate. Too passionate for those who really want to learn about and understand the situation in the Middle East. In the first few pages we are told about little Jewish babies slaughtered in their cribs as Arabs from Pakistan to Morocco celebrated!  Come on!  First, Pakistanis are not Arabs! Neither is their neighbor Afghanistan or its neighbor Iran.  The Arab world starts in Iraq. Indeed, the languages of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan are ALL Indo-European -- meaning they are closer to English than to Arabic. It is out of this fantasy of a geography that this book is written to perpetuate myths and calm Zionist guilt about the Palestinian Nakba (dispossession and ethnic cleansing).  Second, I am not sure where this new blood libel (killing babies in cribs) against Palestinians is coming from (the ratio of deaths in the current Intifada is still 3 to 1 Palestinian to Israeli civilians with higher percentage of children on the Palestinian side.  This book potentially perpetuates more anti-Semitism than a more historically honest description of the situation of the middle east.  Its point about Israel's right to exist is trivial. Israel is a fact of life in the Middle East. It does exist. The question should be does Palestine has a right to exist as a neighbor to Israel, where Palestinians can live in peace without Israeli checkpoints, one-ton bombs and sniping settlers? 
 This is not the kind of book that you want to keep on your bookshelf for future reference. It comes with relatively poor index, examples, and structure. It's always hard to find useful information from this book when you want to find something for reference. I'll go for other Verilog books 
   So the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks. It really does. I'm not sure who their military consultant was, but if Samuel L. has Specialist pins on his collars, you don't call him Sargeant. Women aren't allowed in the Rangers (Nunez), not my rules ladies, Colonel Styles looks a little young to be a colonel (even for the Army), the Army doesn't issue tiger stripe BDU's (Mueller), the list goes on and on. This may not seem that important, but if you're gonna make a movie about the Army, you could at least get some very BASIC (soory, could't resist) things correct.      Yes, it's true that there are many twists and turns in this 'plot', but all that really means, at least in this case, is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay. Hey, if we tell the same story a couple different ways, it makes the story really interesting, right? Not so much. Oh, and that scene where "Specialist" West is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape? Wow, who decided that was a good idea? I don't want to ruin the ending for you, because there's no point in even seeing this movie, and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the 'finale' long before it makes its belated arrival. By the way, how do you follow someone in an Army Humvee w/out them knowing? Seriously. Please spend these 90 or minutes talking with your kid's, reading a book, excercising, writing a review... I dunno, something worthy of your precious time. You've been warned.  By the way, Connie Nielsen looks hot w/ short red hair 
 I have a 19 year old son that has been on stimulants since age 5.  The stimulants work but we're always searching for a better, easier and cheaper solution.  We've tried all types of naturals treatments and biofeedback but they did not work.  I was hoping that Lawlis' book offered some new insights into ADD and it's causes and treatment.  However, I was disappointed to read the same old suggestions about nutrition, diet, biofeedback, etc.  I don't disagree that some people benefit from these treatments but Dr. Lawlis didn't present any new ideas.  
 Poor John Searle. He'll cling to freewill mysticism no matter how much empirical evidence renders the concept nonsensical. He goes to great lengths to describe the evolutionary and biophysical aspects of brain functions but then throws it all out the window by invoking some vague notion of emergence as if it can somehow displace large-scale neuronal activity. So how does an interconnected system of neurons generate freewill and hence destiny-controllability? Searle has no answer. He basically just says it pops out of nowhere. Neurons require activation, at what point do they start magically activating themselves spontaneously to generate freewill? The answer is they do not and the sum body of neurological research bears this out. Herein lies the critical issue. Without freewill humans become nothing more than highest-order primates and the concept of "ethics" and "moral choice" are totally negated. "Choices" now become complex neurocognitive reactions. Human beings become no more responsible for their behavior than any other biological organism. The moral concept of "individual responsibility" is displaced by the causality of complex genetic and environmental variables which determine the patterns of human social behavior. Freewill advocates like Searle are deeply afraid of these implications. Searle is disturbed by the notion that he can no longer hold others morally accountable for their unwanted behaviors. Conservative economists can no longer blame the poor for being poor because they aren't using their freewill to become economically productive. And, of course, the religious community becomes apoplectic at the thought of not being able to morally condemn the heathens. Searle's pontifications under the guise of intellectualism are nothing more than an attempt to cover up his fear of his own total lack of destiny-controllability. Even the word "free" itself is an absurdity. There is nothing in the known universe that conforms to the concept of being "free". All known phenomena have causal relations to other myriad events and just because an abstruse phenomena lacks a detailed explanation does not mean it has become "free" from causal relationships. Searle is afraid that without the concept of freewill society will degenerate into some sort of anarchic hell. Searle along with the other philosophical preists of freewill are on the verge of extinction. It is only a matter of time before developments in neuroscience render the concept of freewill in league with the concept of a flat earth, probably within the next 50 years. Get used to it John you have no choice, literally. 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 I don't understand why they would have a stuffed animal like this. I don't like it at all. It's so disgusting how every minute I try to play with it but all it does is the Nana dog nusing her puppies! THERE IS NO SENSE IN GETTING THIS! Take my advice cause I am a kid at the age of 14 and even when I was 10 I hated it. Don't get it please 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 I bought this book based on the other reviewers comments and read through the whole book.  I usually have an open mind, but this was a tough read for me.  Of all of the fantasies in the book, I only aligned with at most one of them -- or a few brief parts of 2 or 3.  The author seems to be fixated on the relationship between sons and monthers; with the father being the competition for the mother's attention (in the son's view).  Anyway, that's the author's explanation for most of the chapters.    I'm not going to debate the author's point, which on the surface would seem to imply that a single-monther household with only one son would be "ideal", but both the author and I agree that this would not be "ideal".    Anyway, enough of that and on to the book.  The author has gathered up numerous letters from men that were submitted.  The submittal process was fairly random: if readers saw a request at the end of her previous book for women, or in brief blurbs in a couple of print advertisements.  So it seems that the people who would see these requests for input are a small subset of the population, and of those only a small fraction would actually write a letter.  So if you take this book as a conpendum of fantasies from a fringe of society, then you'll start reading the book with the correct mindset.  I'm a little unsure as to how to comment on this book, but I felt compelled to do so because the other reviewers left out something that I would appreciate knowing.  So here's a summary of the book:  1. sons love their mothers, and feel "separated" from them. 2. fathers compete for mothers' affections (i.e. son goes to his room at night and father goes in with mother). 3. the chapters are grouped "sort of" by subject area.  But there is no clear reason to the ordering of the chapters. 4. there appears to be little editing of the letters composing the chapters.  The author even says that she was hesitant to edit the letters.   5. the format of each chapter is usualy a couple of letters, then some commentary, then a couple more letters. 6. the author attempts to portray the letters as a broad swath of society, however from the letters it appears that many of the men writing over 18 have failed marriages or previous marriages (and are on #2 or #3).  In counting up the letters, the divorce rate amongst the letter writers is significantly higher than the US national average (currently at 40% per capita according to divorcereform.org) for those letter writers above 18. The author's own statistics on this in the beginning of the book are misleading because she counts remarried the same as married (this, not divorced).   On the whole, I didn't get much out of this book.  I was expecting something that would put some of my fantasies in context, or give me cool ideas for some fantasies to fantasize about.  But in the end I had trouble relating to this book and chunked it 
 I read the book in a little over two hours.  In the title, Sterling says he is "envisioning the next fifty years."  In fact the book is little about the next fifty years as it is Sterling's own thoughts about the past fifty years.  In the introduction to the book he presents his "seven novel aspects of the twenty-first century."  He does this using a character from Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'; Jaques, who is best know for his famous lecture, which begins with: "all the world's a stage" and ends with "Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."  It would have been more appropriate if Sterling had used Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing.'  Sterling tells us he is both a Science Fiction writer and a Futurologist.  I know a Futurologist when I see one, and Sterling is no Futurologist 
 One day when it was 100 degrees outside, I used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  When I came out and got into my car, it was hotter than I could have ever imagined.  It hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  It looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  I came home, took it off, and threw it out.  I was not satisfied at all 
 This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from.  The first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of "600x." Do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x, the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good.   The finder is useless; a 6x30 is barely adequate, and this is not even that big.  Finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration.  the 1 1/4" size of the eyepiece is creditable, but too high a mignification for this scope.  And the field of view is in doubt, and don't even think of using the barlow.  Buy this scope, and after a few outings, it will most likely sit in the attic.  The review immediately before mine is correct. This is no way to get started in astronomy.  In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope. Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.   Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on this website), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.  For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope. 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 Anyone who knows me would tell you I truly enjoy reading.  I am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours. It took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book. The story just could not keep my interest.  I felt no real affinity to any of the characters.  I have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters.  She writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more.  In the case of this novel I just didn't feel it.  Her other novels will not leave you dissapointed. Ugly ways is not a good example of the Ansa's true talent as a writer.  If you have not done so try her other novels.  I guarantee you will come away wanting to read more 
 After reading A Brief History of Time I decided that I wanted to learn more about Stephen Hawkings himself and how he became who he is today. I picked up this book written by Kitty Ferguson, which is claimed to be a biography and started reading it. After about twenty pages she was done talking about his life and started talking about his theories. This was disappointing to me because I thought the book was a biography.   As I continued reading I became somewhat confused while she told about Hawkings discoveries. The explanations were little or none in trying to get the reader to understand the ideas. It did not help that there were very few small illustrations that were in the book to go along with her explanations. If there were highly detailed color illustrations such as those in A Brief History In Time, it might have been much easier to understand.  I did enjoy the beginning of the book where Kitty goes into detail about the beginning of Hawkings life but I feel like it was just an overview of how he became who he is today. I would not recommend this book, instead I would recommend A Brief History In Time because it is much easier to understand because it has great illustrations and is not so mathematical 
 A one star rating is way too high for this CD 
 I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better. 
 This CD compiles Rhinoceros's second and third albums into one completely unnecessary release. Their second alb (Satin Chickens) was a very weak rehash of their debut; their third alb (Better Times Are Coming) featured a stripped-down band with only a few of the original members left and bears almost no resemblence to the original group's music. Forget this CD and get their fine first one and you'll have everything you need by this band. 
 First, I just want to say that Asma does an admirable job of explaining complex ideas in accessible language.  I just want to amplify the concerns of a previous reviewer who noted Asma's mischaracterizations of the later evolutions of Buddhism. Asma subscribes to a view that is no longer prevalent among Buddhist scholars that Mahayana Buddhism is a perversion of the Buddha's intent, and that the doctrine of emptiness is mystical mumbo jumbo about the ineffable nature of the absolute.   While there may be some Buddhists out there who teach emptiness in this way, it is not representative of traditional Mahayana teachings. In fact, the reliance on reason and investigation are essential to the Mahayana path, and emptiness is a doctrine that expresses Buddhist selflessness in a more systematic and far-reaching way.  The portrayal of the Buddha as a kind of transhistorical figure, with mystical elements in his life story, is also not unique to the Mahayana. The Pali scriptures that Asma primarily relies on are full of such references. Thus, his description of the Buddha's teachings, while intelligent and fun to read, is nonetheless partial and biased.  For a more complete picture of the teachings of the Buddha in the Pali scriptures, you should check out "In the Buddha's Words," edited by Bhikkhu Bodhi 
 This guy cheered when 9-11 happened. Don't buy anything of his.  Knight Ridder Newspapers Oct. 14, 2004 03:08 PM  If Osama bin Laden ever buys a rap album, he'll probably start with a CD by KRS-One. The hip-hop anarchist has declared his solidarity with al-Qaida by asserting that he and other African-Americans "cheered when 9-11 happened," reports the New York Daily News. The rapper, real name Kris Parker, defiled the memory of those who died in the terrorist attacks as he spouted off at a recent New Yorker Festival panel discussion. advertisement   "I say that proudly," the Boogie Down Productions founder went on, insisting that, before the attack, security guards kept Blacks out of the World Trade Center "because of the way we talk and dress. "So when the planes hit the building, we were like, 'Mmmm - justice.' " The atrocity of 9-11 "doesn't affect us the hip-hop community," he said. "9-11 happened to them, not us," he added, explaining that by "them" he meant "the rich ... those who are oppressing us. RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio stations." Parker also sneered at efforts by other rappers to get young people to vote. "Voting in a corrupt society adds more corruption," he added. "America has to commit suicide if the world is to be a better place. 
 This has got to be the most S*~^est Movie ever. It completeley ruined the Friday the 13th Series! Jason did not have Hair and was deformed as a Child  He was on a Boat for most of the Movie, and appeared in New York at the End!  Why the Hell did Jason turn back into a Boy at the End, when he Melted in the Toxic Waste  Jason's Face is just F$"#ing Stupid at the End. I mean Seriously. He looks like Zippy from F$"#ing Rainbow. Why did they even make it? 
 I need a copy of this story for my 4 year old daughter to stress the fact that she shouldn't cry unless something is truly wrong.  In doing my due diligence and trying to see how this book appeared on the inside I found that although text will appear no full illustrations will show.  Ergo I have no idea whether or not this book will be effective.  Needless to say I'm buying another version.  Shame on Pied Piper Paperbacks for not allowing parents to screen thei material for appropriatness 
 The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks 
 I did not like this craphead book at all. I was not excited to pick it up and could not find myself getting hooked in its non-existant story line. The characters were unrealistic and undeveloped. Is"Kit" a good guy or a bad guy? You just can't root for him throughout the story because he is just an unfinished sketch on a chewed up piece of paper. 
 I read this book a while ago (I was a self employed exec recruiter for fifteen years) and it still stands out as one of the silliest. The amount of information either a Manager or another headhunter will glean from this material is negligible. The pages discussing her "schedule" in which she shows us all how hard she works are so laughably self-important that you should skim them in the bookstore for humor's sake. 
 You would think things would be a paradise in S. Africa if you listened to the Danny Glovers and other Black racists in the world.   So, why is S. Africa degenerating even with all the outpouring of money and business given to them once they became Politically Correct?   Hmmmm.   Mandela was a terrorist.   He could have been a free man if only he renounced violence and he choose not to - what does that tell you?   Look at the pictures of the Church Street bombings which he signed off for.   What a whitewash of History.   Disgusting 
 No mention of Anthony Braxton?  Evan Parker?  Sam Rivers?   These are people who developed new extended techniques for saxophone and cannot be ignored in a book as comprehensive as this one purports to be.  Ornette in the list of people that (Charles) Parker moved to tenor?  (I am aware that Ornette has played tenor, but come on folks, Ornette is most known for his alto playing.  He probably has recorded his trumpet more than he has on tenor.)  Dismisses Sun Ra as a "space cadet"?  Sorry, we cannot take Mr. Segall seriously 
 My cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces. However, she can not even use the gift.  You need to buy the Totally Beadifully Jewelry Maker to use this kit.  No where in the online description of this toy on Amazon does it tell you this.  Toy is being returned b/c we don't have the bead maker 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
  Shame on this guy for not stepping out of his own skin and having a little sympathy for his pregant wife. I couldn't even finish this book. It reminded me of some guys I play softball with..totally hung up on themselves, avoiding their wives and children, drinking Budweiser and getting away with it. Of all the ignorance. Who prints this crap? File this one under Dumb People Who Write Books. 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 I thought Silicon Valley was for smart people. A Stanford professor and a retired Cisco executive have managed to write one of the most indecipherable business tombs in recent memory. I was asked to review this book for graduate school and I found it mostly incoherent business babble. "Billiard Ball Management." "Shallowly Rooted Strategic Vectors." "Kinetic Structures Prevail." What kinds of business leaders talk like that today? I often find the best business books package challenging business problems with no non-sense solutions. Save your money. This book is a tower of babble

 Mona Charen cites nearly every example of demagoguery committed by social liberals from 1960 to 1996.  She didn't miss one.  She bashes liberal views of the Great Society of LBJ, the anti-war protests of the 60's, the welfare state, Clarence Thomas' and Robert Bork's nominations, and the crime wave that quieted in the 90's.  Unfortunately, Charen forgets the similar pandering and hypocrisy that has occurred by social conservatives during that same period, an omission that greatly detracts from her thesis.  Another failing is that she attaches exclusive causeology  of NYC's decrease in crime in the 1990's to Guiliani's get-tough policies, and conveniently forgets the complexities of improved economics, changing demographics and the "abortion factor" (as expounded by Leavitt in Freakonomics) as potential contributors.    She glibly assigns culpability to liberals for any number of social ills including unwed mothers, homelessness, violent crime, racial tension and conceiveably ring-around-the-collar.  Her references are numerous, but her arguments are not careful enough for a scholarly work, so the book serves only as red meat for the angry masses screaming about the same old problems of government waste associated with liberal government bureaucracy.  Charen conveniently avoids the huge government waste associated with the current so-called "conservative" government of GWB and the Republican House and Republican Senate.  Charen forgets to cite the Medicare Part D program as the largest social spending  program (inflation adjusted) in history.  She forgets to mention that GWB signed into law a bill written by fellow "conservative" Republicans that represented the largest farm subsidies (inflation adjusted) in history.  Charen neglects to mention that the current "conservative" government has rushed us into a war that will cost half a trillion dollars and has already lasted longer than WWI, WWII and the US Civil War; and Bush did this despite protests by previous Republican cabinet advisors and diplomats.     At the end of the day, this conservative prefers a government that wastes billions of my tax money on unnecessary and counter-productive social programs over one that spends trillions on unnecessary war and mayhem 
 These Benchmark Atlas books are not any better then the Free Atlas you can get from your insurance companies. I bought and returned all of them for the western states.   I was hoping to get more detailed (back roads, etc) maps, also GPS coordinates etc. No in these, Not worth the cost of shipping 
 That this dismal collection of stories comes from a former Pulitzer winner is most disheartening.  The problem is not the novel premise of using tabloid headlines to launch stories, rather, it is the complete lack of insight and imagination that is at work here.  Oh, some of the pieces are clever, milking their conceits for some easy laughs, but never does this come close to the true vision of Butler's prizewinning A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain.  While trying to bring love and understanding to these misunderstood souls, Butler manages only feeble insights, the worst of which, as in "Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover," descend into cheapness.  The best story in the collection, "Jealous Husband Returns in the Form of Parrot," is a rehashing of "Love," a story from Good Scent.  Even worse, Butler's prose, usually not a problem, clunks over attempts at the various dialects ranging from a Britisher on the Titanic to the Alabaman searching for her spaceman.  Hopefully, this book was an attempt to cash in, but if not, Butler has betrayed the promise of possibly great write 
 As a believer in UFOs and much of the paranormal, I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to outré subjects that fall outside the mainstream of public opinion.  With almost no knowledge of Commander X, I was certainly prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt and hear him out.  In a matter of minutes, however, the only thing Commander X convinced me of was the fact that he is way out there on the lunatic fringe.  This is the kind of guy that makes all ufologists, including the most serious, scientifically rigorous of researchers, look like fools to the average man or woman.  What do we know about the guy?  Only that he claims to be a retired military intelligence official who was one of the early participants in remote viewing tests.  We don't know his name, nor do we get to see his face in this particular video - ostensibly because government agents are hot on his trail looking to take him out.  I'm more inclined to believe he remains anonymous because some guys in white coats are looking for him.  There is supposedly a small studio audience with him, along with unknown persons watching via a closed circuit Internet broadcast.  Is there even such a thing as a closed circuit Internet broadcast?    You do have to give the guy some credit for coming up with such a huge number of crazy ideas and attempting to connect them all together - despite the fact that some of them contradict one another.  He leads off with an attack on the supposed New World Order, bemoaning the fact that this secret organization has now gained extreme power through puppets such as President George W. Bush, both American political parties, the UN, and basically everyone who has ever said or done anything that even remotely affects the lives of others.  Commander X claims that the NWO is behind basically everything, sowing the seeds of a military theocracy in the United States.  Ted Bundy, the Son of Sam, and the Columbine killers?  All victims of secret governmental mind control.  Islamic terrorists?  Merely government agents creating the conditions for a fascist state that would deny all Americans their freedom.  He goes on to make ever more laughable charges about the secret government and mind control before moving on to UFOs.  According to Commander X, not only did the Nazis have contact with an alien race, their extraterrestrial allies helped the Nazi elite escape to secret bases in Antarctica and South America along with their own working UFOs - and this secret Nazi power base continues to have a huge effect on world governments, especially those in South America.  Byrd's expedition to Antarctica in 1946, he tells us, was actually a secret military operation against Nazi underground bases, a mission that failed badly.  The alien threat, we are told, saw the NWO shift into high gear, as aliens are the only threat the NWO cannot contain or corrupt.  That is why they are always leaking information to the public about them.  The American government itself, we learn, has had a number of secret deals with the aliens but have been betrayed time and time again.  That's why it's hastening its efforts to discover alien artifacts - including those buried somewhere in Iraq (see, it wasn't about oil at all).    Basically, every "fact" Commander X makes public is more outrageous and laughable than the last: cell phones used for mind control, the removal of human souls to be replaced by alien essences, etc.  It just goes on and on.  After 90 minutes of this rambling "lecture," I would be hard pressed to believe this guy if he told me two and two are four.    The production value of the presentation is less than impressive, as well.  Alongside his hidden face and electronically modified voice, you get a slideshow of historical as well as weird, meaningless images.  Early on, there's also some obvious canned applause - along with intermittent coughs apparently intended to prove that he does indeed have an audience.  He doesn't.  The kicker comes toward the end, though, when someone off-camera whispers in his ear that the broadcast may have been detected and its secret location identified.  It's a perfectly appropriate ending for such a farcical presentation 
 I got this book based on the overall good rating it got and the fact that I like romantic supsense type of books. This one, however, didn't make the mark. The romance portion was barely there and seemed far-fetched. And I wasn't the least bit afraid while reading this book. No good suspense factor for me. I also found that I could put this book down for long periods of time and not be compelled to pick it up again. All in all, I found it to be a waste of my time...I don't think I would try to read another book by this author again 
 I bought this book because I already knew what Jose had to say, but wanted to hear what Jessica had say. The 1st half of the book she said absolutely nothing except repeat how she would catch Jose cheating, they would fight, break up, and get back together again. In fact she just repeats this throughout the whole book. How many times can you read the same story before you get bored?? You really get to the point where you just want to slap her and knock some sense into her for being so stupid.  I really dont know why I kept reading this book. I kept hoping something eventfull would happen, but it never really did. I wouldnt recommend this book unless you want to hear an ex-wifes story about how her husband cheats on her and abuses her in a never ending cycle of 230+ page 
 I have just finished reading Ender's Shadow, the first of the Bean quartet novels and I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed the original book. There's something about the way Card presents characters that captures you into reading the book non-stop. So you can imagine my disappointment when I started reading Xenocide.  Judging from the other reviews, I realized that Xenocide is a kind of a book that you either love as you loved Ender's Game (and everyone loves that one) or hate it because of the way it progresses, portrays characters and overall plot involved.  Frankly, I think I'm in the later category. I was so tired of reading this book that I couldn't force myself to finish it.  Not only the characters were completely unbelieavable, but I thought trying to mix cultures and jump from one to another every chapter was quite pointless. I admit, it was daring on Card's part to try to attempt it, but he just couldn't handle it, I think. The same way as he couldn't handle brining too much fiction into sci-fi realm. Some of the plot twists were completely outrageous even for sci-fi standards. And mixing so many philosophical topics in under-300 pages book is simply wrong. You can't expect to try to find a solution to life, death, soul, humanity and everythign else he tried to mention using nothing but a bunch of unbeliavable 'wanna-be' genius characters. And to add to all this disappointment is the sheer normality of Ender Wiggin. It's as if he's in this book just to remind us that it's part of the series. He really was not needed in this novel at all.   In conclusion, I thought the book lacked progression, pace, presentation and believable characters. Overall, it was a pretty poor novel, but I guess every writer gets one of those once in a while (some more so than others).  It's worth reading, but don't feel like you're betraying the series if you suddenly have an urge to throw the book away. it just happens to be poorly written. 
 For those people who didn't make it through the book, here is a (perhaps oversimplified) summary.  Assumption 1 : Machines function algorithmically. The human brain functions at least partly non-algorithmically   Assumption 2 : There are some mathematical problems that can not be solved by algorithms f.i. proving the correctness of a self-referring statement.   Conclusion from 1 and 2 : Humans are able to solve problems that machines will never be able to solve.  Assumption 3 : Intelligence means being able to solve every possible problem.  Conclusion : Humans are intelligent, machines will never be intelligent.  My thoughts on this :  assumption 1 : Non-algorithmically ? There is not a shred of evidence of non-algorithmic thinking in humans. There are on the other hand plenty of mechanisms taking place in the brain that are clearly algorithmic (like vision, pattern recognition etc.)  assumption 2 :  Apparently Penrose believes that humans are able to solve these problems. I am not so sure. I challenge you to answer the next question correctly : Will you answer "no" to this question ? It cannot be answered correctly. It is in the nature of the problem itself. The problems Penrose mentions are of the same nature.  assumption 3 : We don't know the nature of consciousness. We have no understanding of what intelligence implies. Penrose believes it implies that an intelligent creature is able to solve EVERY problem. Therefore, if there is one problem a machine can not solve, the machine is not intelligent. So the only thing Penrose has to do to prove his point is ask a question that has no correct answers : ask the machine to overcome the incompleteness theorem of G?del, or to answer the above question correctly. (and ignore the fact that people cannot answer it correctly either).  I have enjoyed the book in a way ... while seeking arguments to demolish Penrose's theory. 
 I read all of David's books and was very moved..however Richard's seemed to hit alot of the same incidents..in either case I can't believe no one ever spoke up to help..I do feel David's books were better written .. I feel bad anyone would have to go through life as they did.. I wouldn't pass this book as I feel it almost reads the same as David' 
 This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.  Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror 
 I can see very little reason for the Dalai Lama to write a book on science.  He is out of his league in writing this book.  He does not at all understand his subject matter.  His points on the convergence of modern physics and Buddhist philosophy are irrelevant.  First, any similarities between modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and Buddhist philosophy are purely coincidental, and are not reflective of any deep truth.  We arrive at scientific knowledge through a process of hypothesization and experimentation, the hypotheses being rigidly defined and definitely falsifiable.  Buddhist philosophy does not contain this same element of falsifiability, its grounding in the empirical world being loose and open to interpretation.  One cannot describe an objective procedure to rigorously falsify a Buddhist claim.  Further, these claims are not rigidly defined, and widely open to interpretation, unlike the claims of modern physics, which result in a single answer to a calculation (although in practice one will end up making subjective approximations, but there is a procedure for estimating the error incurred in these approximations).  Second, it is not at all surprising that one can draw some superficial parallels between physics and Buddhism, because the body of Buddhist thought is large enough and equivocal enough that one could point to similarities no matter what physics' worldview is.  I do not understand the Dalai Lama's request that research in the subject of consciousness include internal examination.  The definition of the nature of this internal examination is unclear, and procedure for carrying it out are not described.  His suggestions are useless to scientists without being made more clear.  His claims on what science is and is not capable of achieving or understanding are based on insufficient knowledge.  Even respected, established scientists who make claims on what science cannot achieve have historically been proven incorrect many times over.  I commend the Dalai Lama's interest in science.  Further, I am amazed at his open-mindedness in writing, "if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."  He proved true to his word in renouncing certain Buddhist beliefs about the physical workings of the universe.  However, his understanding of the method and teachings of science proved superficial when he argued that because science has not conclusively proven it completely understands the beginning of the universe or the origin of life, this leaves room for supernatural influence to have caused the universe to exist, or for new souls to inherit old ones through reincarnation.  Science treats questions of the supernatural (defined as those things beyond nature, in other words those things that can not be observed) as fundamentally unanswerable and uninteresting, but the Dalai Lama does not seem to understand this attitude.  The Dalai Lama has discussed science with many leading researchers and philosophers of science, such as David Bohm and Arthur Zajonc.  I have no doubt that these he is well-informed, and that these men have done their best to impart their knowledge.  But the gap between Western and Eastern thought in this case may be too wide to be easily bridged, and the responsibility lies in another man to do it.  It may be that no one alive has a truly deep understanding of both Buddhist philosophy and the philosophy of science.  Finally, I also applaud the Dalai Lama's calls for collaboration, and his attempts to spread some introductory knowledge of Buddhist thought.  But the task of creating productive dialogues between scientists and Buddhists is an overwhelming one, involving not only language barriers, but barriers involving fundamental modes of thought.  This book is not equal to the challenge, but I think the Dalai Lama's initial efforts are at least a step in the right direction 
 I am very disappointed in the quality of this CD. 24 hits on this CD. But sound quality is poor and CD is not fluid. Kind of skippy 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  It doesn't provide the real world facts about making an indie film as other books do.  It reads like an introductory textbook that skates over all the issues, but never really tells you the things you want to know about how to finance, cast, and sell an indie.  Don't waste your money here 
 I am a long time fan of le Carre - have read and loved all his books - until this one. I just could not summon the interest to finish it. Yes, I'm sort of curious about why this guy's wife was killed, but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there. I was on vacation and had nothing else to do, yet still, I could not wade through this mind-numbing book. I got about half way through - did I quit reading too soon? Did it suddenly pick up after that?  If you're new to John le Carre, start with an earlier book - seriously. Because he's a wonderful writer, really

 This book wants to make you a Christian, it tells you that Mo is bad and Jesus is good. It's very unfair as it trumpets the merits of Jesus while saying Mo was cruel and self-indulgent.  ..but it makes no mention of Jesus's bad points and the nasty bits in the New testament where for instance Jesus encourages the beating of slaves (Luke 12:47) and the bit where Jesus tells you to burn unbelievers (John 15:6, Matthew 13:41-42).  Dr Gabriel obviously loves Jesus and hates Muhammad but for all Muhammad's faults he wasn't dumb enough to curse a fig-tree for not bearing fruit while it was out of season (Matthew 21:18-19, Mark 11:13-14).  Dr Gabriel also tells you with relish that Muhammad stole from trade caravans by going on ghazi raids on enemy merchants but he fails to point out that Jesus broke the law by stealing corn on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23), and he encouraged his disciples to take a horse without asking permission (Matthew 21).  The point i'm trying to make (rather laboriously) is that neither Jesus or Mo were perfect and that both men did some awful things in their times and great suffering has often resulted from their respective legacies and folks like Dr Gabriel don't help us understand things by selectively reading the bible and quran and dissing one guy while extolling the merits of the other.   this really is a stupid and infantile book ...does this guy really have a PhD? 
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 This was a great toy.  I would drive it around the fish tank, pretty easy to control and lasted 5-10 minutes on a charge.  Unfortunately something happened with my charging base after about 20-30 uses (few months), and it stopped working.  Not sure what happened 
 I wish I hadn't wasted seven years of my life reading this absurd book. Initially, it even prompted me to join the Trappist Order which resulted in serious psychological damage that I am STILL working through. I'll say this  though; there should definitely be a screenplay because while the book does  not effectively translate from the page I can see how Kurt Russel could  bring to life so many of these saints to the big screen. I'd pay to see  that flick, wouldn't you? Anyway, dont' read this book unless you have some  sort of serious complex involving a deep desire for some self-flaggelation 
 My friends and I just read this as part of our new "Fashion-Group Book Club"...I didn't dislike it as much as they did, but it does give one reason to marvel at how much completely unspectacular writing and recycled bollocks make it to publication.  It even came to us recommended so I'm surprised at how just-not-good it is.  Even the pictures, the best part, are all ones I swear I've seen a million times before.  So, if you're looking for photos of Kate, I remember a book that came out on her in the nineties, a lot more expensive of course, but that one was excellent.  "Model of Imperfection": not recommended 
 Before you accept any information in this book at face value, double-check it with another source (preditorsandeditors is a great source).  Some of the agents in this book are scam artists.  The fact that the author (who, as another reviewer pointed out, comes across as smug and obnoxious), either didn't know who he was recommending, or didn't care, should be enough to steer people away from this book

 Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return

 This albums sucks so bad. There is only one true reviw on the page the one that says this ablums gay is right this album is gay. G-Unit is way better then ja rule or murder inc. He needs to stop saying s**t like whats his name no one care what his name is. There is usually one song i like on ja rules albums, this time it is wonderful ft. R. Kelly & Ashnti. This song is pretty good Kelly does outstanding, not much Ashanti but he uses her too much, needs to get another r&b female (he can't). Ja Rule does a little better then usual on this song. Overall this album is 1/10 
 The year: 1965. The cast: Peter Sellers. Peter O'Toole. Woody Allen. Ursula Andress. The soundtrack: Burt Bacharach. Tom Jones. Dionne Warwick. Manfred Mann. The movie: Believe it or not -- terrible. Really... as in unwatchable (other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits.) Painfully unfunny slapstick routines, actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards, and no plot to speak of. Not even fun to watch for 60's camp value like The Party or Casino Royale... I had to turn it off at about the halfway mark. Grade: Incomplete  Safest bet: Get the soundtrack, skip the movie... 
 I threw this away, and these are all the mistakes I remember.  On one picture in Fuschia's catch 'em all, it shows Weedle instead of Gyrados.  You get 30 safari balls, not 20.  This stupidity says it has every area, but I've found areas it doesn't list!  There are much more than 3 islands! There are 7!  They spelt "Explosion" "Exposion."  If you gave this 5, 4, or 3-and-a-half, give it a 1 
 wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a "punk" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this "nu-emo" trend is.  now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure.  all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi.  bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened 
 I liked David Cross more when he was the violinist for King Crimson in the 1970's.  His comedy pales in comparison to his progressive rock credentials.  Hopefully, David will call up Robert Fripp and get it together with Crimson again.. 
 Sounds like every other I'm such a sensitive sad male garbage that is flooding corporate radio stations. Boo hoo.  The bravado of these people to take a beautiful song (all is full of love) and puke on it.  It really makes me sick to my stomach 
 The premise is intriguing: the Allies have lost WWII, the US has been partitioned, and Nazi atrocities continue in the US and Africa. But Dick spends far too much time developing the backstory through tedious dialogue, and on explaining the factional infighting among German leaders, neither of which advances the plot or tells us about his characters. I also found the use of the I-Ching to reveal the characters' psychology and to create mood to be ineffective and unconvincing, more a reflection of the Alan Watts-style mysticism of the Beats than an outgrowth of anything in Japanese culture; i.e., just a plot device, and a poorly chosen one.  I imagine the admiring portrayal of Japan and of the Japanese characters was brave for its time, but it nonetheless is inflected with a slight contempt: while German science has developed sophisticated plastics, the Japanese continue to make do with wood. But Dick was scarily prescient with his Japanese characters' odd obsession with Americana, such as Mickey Mouse watches; I'd be curious to know to what extent this had begun even in the 50s.  Overall, very disappointing; it doesn't approach my favorite Dick novel, "A Scanner Darkly", a real masterpiece 
 i'm sorry but this is one of the weakest biographies i have ever read (and yes, i have read more than one). the writing is very poor, it reminds me of a grade 8 essay where you can easily see the way the facts have been jotted down in point form and then strung together to form sentences and paragraphs. i feel like half the time the author was simplky reciting a stat or tidbit jotted down on a cocktail napkin.  hendrix never comes alive in this book, you never get a feel for who the man was or where his genius came from and took him. it all feels very quick and breezy, little commentary or insight and more just a retelling of facts long since comitted to the annals of rock legend.  i daresay that the author would have done well to read the few cover stories on jimi put out over the years by britain's mojo magazine. these manage, in their few short pages, to tell the same story in a far deeper and more meaningful way.  when one compares this with - for example - neil young's biography 'shakey' by jimmy mcdonough, one can immediately see the difference between a well written biog and a poorly written one. icons are always a tough creature to dissect, there are layers and layers of worship and legend to get through to get to the real facts and paint a glimpse of the real person. but this also involves good writing; a biographer cannot simply write as a journalist, reciting facts and taking a time-out from any sort of personal insight or commentary. ultimately a good biographer seeks to explore the individual, to journey through their life and vividly assemble and comment on the facts, events, rumours, heresay, and legends that create that persona.  that is rarely done in this biog. this is a safe, conservative, backseat look at an artist who was rarely anything other than a complex genius who truly needs to be looked at with a critical as well as factual eye to fully understand.  not so the case here. skiiiiiiiiip it.   
 I also bought this book because of high praise here. After going through it several times, I am forced to conclude that it has been of no help at all in planning my visit to SE Asia.  
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 I bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when I replaced my Palm m105 with an HP IPAQ. The palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and I used in nearly every day.  After my positive experience I expected my new IR keyboard to function the same way.  What a dissapointment! I can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me. I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys.  The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The "mouse" arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys. Finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard (unlike the stowaway). I will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search 
 This book is filled with baseball cards.  If you want to get the price of a card you can open this book right up and find it 
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 "The Girls Guide to NASCAR" would have been a great book if  segments such as the "girlfriends" tidbits were ommitted; some female race fans are older than 16.  The question that refers to "the possiblity of a driver taking notice" assumes that every female is in the hunt for a man when she is inside the garage area.  I truly hope this is not the case.  I have read another guide of this type which was just as informative without the high-school, teenie bopper focus.  Not every girl is a Kasey Kahne fan just waiting for him to notice........My wife bought this book hoping for an insider's view, which she got.  But it wasn't the kind of inside information she was looking for.       
 I must say I find very suspicious all of those brief, five-star anonymous reader reviews below, all supposedly from different parts of the country but all praising the book with the exact same language: "a classic", "insightful" and even comparing it to the classic by Octavio Paz 'A Labyrinth of Solitude.' The 'Labyrinth of Solitude' this book is NOT. I approached this book--and the work of Stavans in general--based on the blurbs by writers and authors of such high reputation as Henry Louis Gates, Gregory Barrasa and others but I am sorely dissapointed. I'm happy if Stavans can exist as a 'Hispanic' (rather than a Latino) in the 'hyphens' Americans tend to create to label non-whites, but language is not the only force shaping cultures. This books seems to shine only if you forget the historic forces that have forced millions of Latinos to be labeled with the hyphens of compound identities. His posturing on a number of important issues--bilingual education, Latino sexuality, affirmative action--is more often than not biased and superficial, and worse of all, feels like the posturing of an academic unconcerned with the fate and the condition of Latinos in general. This makes you realize that there is no such thing as a 'Hispanic condition.' A thought-provoking but ultimately confused and superficial book. Strictly to please white 'Hispanic' academics. Read or reread 'The Labyrinth of Solitude' by Octavio Paz and 'Massacre of the Dreamers' by Ana Castillo for more compelling reading on the 'Latino Condition. 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 When a historian deliberately sets out to idolize a conqueror, no matter how great, he or she has himself or herself to blame for being disbelieved.  I don't know any modern biographer of Alexander except William Tarn who took such a one-sided attitude to this man.  This book even claims that now an "accurate, balanced, and convincing" biographty is possible (implying you know which book meets this high standard).  I beg to differ.  It really bothers me when a historian refuses to face reality.  Though I am an admirer of the great king, I think Rogers's whole perspective is wrong.  He seems to think that Alexander did what he did in order to create a sort of commonwealth for all "sons of Zeus" - including the Persians, the Indians, etc. - all for their benefit.  Even worse, Rogers compares Alexander with Truman and Churchill, because Truman atomic bombed Japan and Churchill made a mistake in World War I which cost some innocent lives.  Leaving aside his comparison of Alexander with Mozart for the moment - he makes this comparison because Mozart also "disturbs our rest" - I don't see how a fair-minded person, let alone a historian, can say such things.  Had Japan not been atomic bombed, Japan would not have surrendered, and an invasion of mainland Japan had been estimated to cost a million GIs - dead - and who knows how many more Japanese lives?  As for Churchill, it is one thing to make a tactical error, but quite another to kill people as the aggressor.  It is clear that Rogers does not even care to look objective.  It is a wonder that he doesn't compare Alexander with George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Theresa.  The assertion, which Rogers repeatedly makes, that Alexander was no Hitler or Stalin is, on the face of it, quite correct.  But it that saying much for the blood-soaked invader?  Hitler and Stalin are quite plainly the worst mass-murderers in all history.  So I'm not sure what Rogers is really aiming to prove here, except that no comparison is too extreme for him to support that particular viewpoint which he holds.  Clearly, Alexander's homosexuality is something Rogers is uncomfortable with.  So he adds this bombshell after all the rationalizing: "Yet the umambiguous evidence that sex was central to their [Alexander with Hephaeistion] relationship is conspicuously absent."  One needs to be a lawyer to parse this sentence, but I can think of no easier way for a historian to weasel out of this fact about Alexander than such a precise statement.  You want to know what is "unambiguous evidence," what "central" means, and above all what Rogers means by "sex."  Robin Lane Fox and Peter Green certainly believed Alexander's relationship with Hephaeistion was sexual.  Paul Cartledge also.  Indeed most reputable biographers admitted as much.  Tarn, for obvious reasons, did not.  But then I suppose no amount of evidence would seem "unambiguous" enough for Rogers - short of a baby!  Even then Rogers would doubt such a baby would prove anything, DNA testing not yet available then to establish paternity.  Can I blame Rogers?  It wasn't so long ago that a well-known public figure claimed he didn't have a sexual relationship (just "an inappropriate relationship") with his intern because, as it turned out, he had defined "sex" as full intercourse only.  I suppose there are some things two men can't do with each other no matter how hard they try (like making a baby).  I hope you have an idea by now the premises from which Rogers attempts to argue throughout this book.  The trouble with Alexander is that there are different ways to look at the facts, and the facts themselves are often hard to come by.  Rogers's claim to "accuracy, balance, and conviction" is not as simple as the "ABC" which these words happen to stand for, when it comes to so elusive a figure.  The very ancient nature of the saga is a problem, for we must rely on the veracity and the resources of the ancient historians, like Arrian, who themselves wrote long after the events.  But it does startle me when a writer takes an interpretation which differs so much from the ones I know from the biographies written by A. R. Burn, Lane Fox, Green, Paul Cartledge (the recent addition) and especially A. B. Bosworth - all highly reputable historians of Alexander and specialists of ancient Greece.  I may be wrong, but I smell something fishy about this book.    
 This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him.  Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring.  However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.  If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better.  Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior 
 I bought this book because I wanted to look into the mind of Damien Echols.  I suppose I did accomplish this to some extent because his writing is honest, if adolescent.  Damien reveals himself as not a monster, not a hero, but as a somewhat self centered and bitter suburban boy-man.  His life experiences after his arrest are so limited that he depends on the somewhat trite events of his childhood and teen years as the basis of his world view.  His religious search, ending in Buddism, is questionable in that his supposedly deep spiritual voyage ends in yet another unconvincing conversion.  He is no longer the 19 year old black-wearing suburban "magick" deadbanger at the end of the book, he has been transformed into a white (prison) uniformed vegetarian Buddist of 30.  And yet, a distinct narcissistic overtone spoils any genuine belief that he might have transcended a youth that he so despises.  Do I know Damien better after reading this book?  Yes, but I'm not sure that I like him 
 I bought this book to update my self on Java EE 5. However when I come to Chapter 9 and I try to run Jboss session bean samples it seems that things have changed since the moment they wrote the book. And I'm sure specification of EJB3 and JBOss will change until final realease.  I wrote to the authors but I never had an answer to my questions, so it did the experiencie a little bit more frustrating.   I learnt not to buy books of things under development!, 
  If you want to know the truth about the time and people portrayed in this book try reading Lost Astronaut or one of dozens of other books written by the astronauts and the people closest to them at the time. There are many many excellent books. I have had the pleasure to read most of them. THIS IS A MOVIE at best and a LIE at worst. I hope Tom made lots of money.   
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 I watched Kramer vs. Kramer and came away laughing during most of the movie. I have never seen people take themselves so seriously, trapped in a land of esoteric garble.   Hoffman's character, Ted, needs to grow some balls, and learn how to make coffee, as he is over the age of 40. Streep's character needs to refill her Prozac script and start reading Sylvia Plath, maybe that would make her somewhat interesting.  Sex is out of the question with such a placid, dull woman: just go to the morgue, it would have more passionate hunks of humanity, and probably smarter, too.  The most hilarious line was in the coutroom when Streep's character said:   " Ted was unable to deal with my feelings and this lowered my self-esteem. I've worked very hard to be a whole human being. And I don't think I should be punished for that."  Woe is me! How is this idiotic woman being punished! Being forced to move from the Upper West side to the Upper East side or maybe the real punishment was switching from Espresso to Maxwell House coffee? Oh, The Humanity of it ALL!!!!  And the child doesn't need his parents: he needs six to ten years of special ed. 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 The problem with this book was that the secondary female character of Avalon overshadowed the more demure and sweet younfg Jessica totally. The whole relationhip build up with Jessica and Dash never amounted to anything, and her relationship with the man of her dreams was also a final epilgoue in the last five pages of the book. Another female characcter in Sasha, and some stuff straight out oa Harelquin romance, made this book really tedious.   I was looking for something a lot more intense. And I never did understand why Jessica gave her boyfriend the boot.  she really was not interesting at all.  For those who like spanking, great, otherwise, yawn 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 Joseph Nye keeps repeating himself: multilateralism by global American charm attack. That is simply a stupid assumption. And it is untrue of American history in foreign relations. Nye still owes some answers to European scholars of International Relations who criticized his idea. In fact that is no personal multilateral approach.. 
 This is all around a pretty mediocre, uninspired exposition of quantum field theory.  More recent works by Weinberg and Peskin & Schroder, for example, are far more coherent and elegant 
 I began reading this book quite a few years ago but elected to stop after forty pages.  It is aimless, vile, and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Be warned: this is one you'll be ashamed to put in the garage sale...if you don't decide to just set it up in flames and put it out of its misery first 
 Babies don't scare me except when I have to change a dirty diaper.  The storyline of "It's Alive" simply did not interest me and I found myself bored, bored and bored.  I don't think this storyline works very well and as a result I think the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie.  If you want to make this into some kind of a politically motivated flick as a reviewer mentioned above, that is fine, but that's the only way anyone would be able to read any interest into this plot because the actual movie itself for entertainment purposes is sadly inept 
 im sure ill here alot from this review but everyone giving this movie 5 stars i dont see how or why.have you people just been introduced to the movie world?this movie is awful between the bad acting and the annoying music playing during talking scenes its flat out frustrating.rusty james brother in this movie acts like a mental case for you peole that havent seen this he dies in the end (i just saved you an hour and a half of your life cause now you wont have to waste it on this crappy movie).between the bad music the bad acting and the plot/storyline going all over the place in this movie its seriously like being on a bad acid trip.what a waste of money and time on this one.ill donate mine to goodwill or the garbage can..not worthy of my movie collection 
 I hate it when good bands go bad. I heard the 1st track on the radio a few days ago and said to myself is that Crossfade? Then sure enough it was I was like cool they have a new cd out. It's been out sence August ('06) and didn't even know that should've clued me in but I figured it was Crossfade their last cd rocked this one should too, boy was I wrong. Washing the world away is the only song that kind of sounds like the pervious cd which I'm sure is why it was on the air. I'm majorly dissapointed the song Colors on the last cd was really awesome then they go and ruin it with some wussy crap, the air waves are already full of that. Maybe the next cd they'll go back to what made them and stop trying to be like everyone else 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 Richard, there must be more info in all the research that you did.  I thought you would pick up where Anthony Sommers left off.  Hoovers faults were taken rather lightly instead of showing what an evil person he was-probably the most flagrant violator of civil rights this country has ever seen.  I do give you credit for the fact you did bring up-if you didn't tow his line , you were ostrasized.  His crime fighting skills were vastly overrated 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 The fourth edition of this book has a slightly different title than the fifth edition. Amazon has not made this distinction clearly on the title section of this page. Just look at the title at the top of this page and then compare it with the photo of the book's cover.   Fourth ed. -Applied Linear Regression Models Fifth ed. - Applied Linear Statistical Model 
 Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music. 
 West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.  The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.  At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.  The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.  On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.  There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.  Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.  As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention. 
 This text and CD set gives a decent practical introduction to Italian, with clear and manageable grammar information. I would estimate that it is equivalent to a college semester of a language, if you learn this text well.  CDs give very clear and lovely examples of Italian conversational speech. One can follow along in the text; this is very helpful.  The format of the text, however, makes it somewhat difficult to review, and there isn't even a vocabulary list at the end of each chapter! This is a serious flaw.  I would prefer also extensive review exercises at the end of the chapter.  Instead, there are only small practice sessions embedded in the the text. I would like this format--it makes it seem manageable--if only there were also review sections at the end 
 The only thing I can think to say about this book of poems is that they are TERRIBLE.  I've never heard so may nasty words - I mean really nasty, sex words, that do not belong in decent books.  I feel ashamed to have read them, and cannot recommend this book to anyone 
 I don't really get how this book got more than one star! The writing in this book was very weak compared to other romance authors out there. The sentences were short. The paragraphs were short. The descriptions of the people were short. Maybe it's just this book that Jo Beverley wrote that was boring, but I don't recommend this one 
 At least that's what my wife said after seeing Sass on the Canadian Idol final. I'd have to agree. Sass is a buttsmack, worse yet a squalling buttsmack who can't hold a tune. Lay off the smokes Sass!!!  By the way, some may say my cat makes better music hacking up a hairball. That's the truth!!! 
 I didn't buy the CD...I couldn't make it past the samples. I loved Constantine on Idol. I didn't think he was the best there, but I thought he was near the top. Performance wise though, this guy can perform on stage...I just love him. This music though, not impressed. I understand why he would want to promote his original band, but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own. He did so good on Idol and had so many fans. Granted, I'm sure some will buy this CD just because they are a fan. And I'm sure that there are some that will love it. I'm not one of them though. I really wanted to like it, but I just can't. That said though, I would really like to see the Constantine from Idol make his own CD. Now that one I would buy 
 An earlier version of this book, was my favorite, most referenced Oracle DBA book. I purchased the new edition without a thought.. unfortunately. Book has minimal revision to allow it to be republished, with all the out dated stuff left in. Any other Oracle 9i book will be a better purchase 
 Hardly.  I'm not sure what the definitive source on risk managment for software projects is, but this isn't it.  Not even a good primer.  
 The lonely planet london had some good walking tours, but for the most part, terribly out-dated in terms of prices for museums/attractions and also many stores/restaurants/internet spots have since closed.  The maps are decent 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 this book wastes alot of pages just for margin. not an easy to read book. the whole semester, we only covered 5 chaps, alot of material is not useful for undergraduates. 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 I like Sam Elliott movies very much. This one was BAD!!! A lot of Bad Language. Every couple of words. It should be rated R. I think instead of PG 
 The author had a BRILLIANT idea writing this book, however she couldn't accomplish and develop a chain of reasoning. She is PROLIX and way too boring. The reading has to be dragged.   This is not a book, this is her personal JOURNAL, which I suppose it's much easier to write than a book.  She vomits words and texts in these pages, and the reader has to SCAN through them, trying to find something worthy to read. You can spot very FEW interesting things about her experience. It's exausting, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.   She couldn't organize her experiences and consequent feeling into wise words. So, if you plan to buy this book to get some advice from the author, just drop it! She won't help you at all. She is just gonna give you obvious phrases like "I comtemplated the nirvana and longed for Zoloft". Give me a break!!!   Be wise, and NOT BUYING THIS BOOK will be the right choice. Because, buying is all about choices 
 There is absolutely no development of the Trilogy concept here, and as such it is only character filler and not that coherent as a novel.  Asimov knew what would sell, and he wrote some great stuff, but to be honest I thing he wrote WAY too much.  THis is too much.  Not recommended 
 While this unit may be as accurate as described, I nonetheless had to return it because it was an extremely uncomfortable, annoyingly intrusive fit on my wrist. 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 "Laconic" may be a favorable description of a Western hero, but it should not apply to the book which tells that hero's story.  This is a poor effort by an otherwise talented writer.  The big gunfight is a poor rip-off of the OK Corral tale, the characters are not well developed, and the book ends with a thud.  The only good thing about the short chapters and wide spacing is that the reader has wasted less time with this hollow core of what should have been a good story.  Read "Ride the Dark Trail" to see what a Western should be 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 Classic Pud here.  I'm guessing he did this on purpose, just to flaunt something, not sure what.  Literally Cut, Paste, Spell Check, Get 1,000,000 check.  End of story 
 I bought this for my 3 year old son. He was not intersted in all the talking by "Laurie Dash". Too many jokes that aren't funny or related to the hero and not enough action to keep a young child interested. The "There goes a...firefighter/hero/police officer...series is much better. There is a host but also lots of action to keep a young childs attention 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 How bad is it when you hate the lead heroine? You don't care about the hero. The author admitts to change facts about the historical events she puts in the book. The villain becomes the hero and you realize the only people you like in the story are Future King of England and his wife? Welcome to the horrible Warrior's Song.  The heroine Chandra is suppose to come off as a warrior/lady but she comes off as a spoiled brat. Her constant whining and disreguarding anything anyone tries to tell her gets old fast. She more then once goes against any sound advice (common sense) getting herself into dangerous and stupid situations that your sadden that she lives. There's nothing heroic or likable about Chandra.   Jerval is written as coming in to save her from the villain (who by the end of the book is supposely the hero of the story despite him raping one of her ladies in the beginning of the story) Jerval isn't written well enough for you to care about him.  There's nothing herotic about rape and letting the villain become one is disgusting.  Catherine Coulter admitts at the end she nixed the part of the Crusades which I hate. If your going to write about a historical event such as the Crusades in particular a well known battles, with well know people keep it factual. Don't change it or speed it up. What's the point of the story if your change the facts?  That brings me to the two only charactors that held my interest were (oddly enough) Prince Edward (future King of England) and his Princess. Truly those were the only two keeping me going.  In fact when Edward was facing death was I the only one wishing it was Chandra and she would die? The ending makes no sense. You don't ever get the feeling of romance, love or even like between the charactors.  Don't waste your time or money on this book.        
 No kidding!!  The shipping charge on these batteries was over $6.00.  Amazon doesn't itemize the shipping charges on your order, so if you order multiple items, you won't know that you're being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late! 
 This toy did keep my child's attention for a while, however it broke on the second use.  One of the blue panels snapped and then the next day the other side did as well.  I was able to return it to JCPenneys without a problem, but we did not buy another one.  
 Home Lands is an interesting collection of vignettes of Jewish communities and families. But this book is thin in its assertion that a new, strong Judiasm is unfolding across the world. Tye uses very few communities to illustrate his point, and ultimately, the book becomes contrived. Because the stories themselves were not groundbreaking enough or entertaining enough to stand on their own, Tye tries desperately to sew them together with his thesis, which might be interesting if one could believe that a handful of communities represent all the world's Jews. To be frank, this book is dwarfed by a multitude of books on the subject that are backed by much more research 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 Let's all send her a letter of thanks for trying to kill all the men in our lives with high cholesterol, saturated fat and hardened arteries, way to go Rache!....Two thumbs WAY down 
 This pillow was hard as a rock and very uncomfortable. you might as well lay on your bed without any pillows if you are going to lay with this flat, uncomfortable, hard plank of a wood of a pillow. 
 The book is AMAZING!  The CD is HORRIBLE!  Stick to reading the book yourself.  I have over 45 audio books...and this was like listen to a bad commercial.  I had to turn it off. There is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading.  They don't even state who the narrator is!  I recommend the book to anyone.  The content is life changing 
 Reads like an 880-page Disney press release.  Who cares?  Obviously, in a transparent effort to get the toothpaste back into the tube, the Disney Co. hopes to erase a decade or so worth of damaging publicity by hand-picking a stenographer to re-establish the Disney myth.  The agenda is clear, and the result is an amatuerish, bloated, over-written and overwrought cover job.  Not serious journalism and not worth your time 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 This movie was awful.  I kept watching it because I thought eventually it was going to get better but it never did.  The plot:  two men abandon their wives and children to find themselves, but really all they are doing is chasing young women in the tropics. They carry on a "three-some" relationship with one woman.  One guy continues travelling, the other finally goes home to his family but in all his arrogance suggests to his wife she's lucky to have him home for as long as he stays. Do not waste your time - you will wish you had the two hours of your life back 
 Any band that releases an album with a song titled "Rock You Tonight" should be banned from ever recording ever again.  I wish that rule would have been in place during Firehouse's hayday.  Thank goodness people were sick of this stale brand of Rock and quickly switch to more substantial listening choices.  
 This CD is not bad but it is not great.  Call it what you want; EMO, punk, alternate; it does not travel over any new ground.  It has been done before and better by a host of bands. I don;t know what the story is on these EMO bands, but it is kind of like a [soda taste] test. So many of them are so similar that you can't tell the difference.  The Sex Pistols did this years ago and a lot better!  At least they were original!  [....]  If you truly want something new and different, look elsewhere 
 I recently bought this DVD together with "Master Drummer Series: Thione Diop Teaches Djembe and Dunun Rhythms of Senegal", as they both had great reviews. I'm a beginner and I was looking for a DVD that would teach me some different rythms, preferrably in an easy "play along" way.   If that is what you too are looking for then I would really recommend you to skip this DVD and go with Thione Diop's DVD!! The "Remembering How to Drum: Djembe Technique" was a big dissapointment and I can't understand how it has gotten such good reviews (even if there is just eight reviews) - are you friends of the producer??  
 From the reviews, I was expecting more.  The word "discipline" was used so often without giving a clear definition or clear steps of how to obtain it.  A lot of the meaning of this book was lost in ramblings about their authors own lives, families, and innate discipline.  Mostly the emphasis was on maintaining a strict schedule and talking to yourself in your head to trick yourself into doing something.  Yes, positive affirmation can go a long way to training the mind to achieve your goals, but this approach was unscientific and childish.  Save your money 
 I did not find this book as helpful as I was hoping. First, and most importantly, I needed more examples. There was only one and it was a service organization and I needed to see an example of a manufacturing organization where the target customer was not so geographically limited. Also, I found that the way the book is organized was difficult. I felt the book was more oriented toward helping someone sort out their thoughts and feelings about starting a business than it was focused on actually structuring and writing a business plan. What I actually need are the hard, factual mechanics of writing a business plan and I did not find it to my satisfaction in this book 
 Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews.  I was almost in tears I was so bored.  It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie!  I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable.  Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible.  The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog.  When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable.  Boy were we wrong.  This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Don't waste your time 
 I'm writing this review not to jump on the reviewing bandwagon, but as a musical person and a songwriter.  God, what an atrocity. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this but whatever it was i'm glad they didn't go on to make anymore of it. Mediocre, bland and instantly forgettable are the 3 things that come to mind when i think of this album. After purchasing their debut album, Designing a Nervous Breakdown, i was instantly hooked on the trading of male and female vocals and the kooky keyboard hooks. Simply genius that album is, and i'll love it for years to come.  As for this one, do yourself a favor and everyone else within a 100 mile radius. Don't listen to it 
 that a book about real estate (creating FINANCIAL independence no less), both residential and COMMERCIAL, and covers no math, no numbers.  How can a book even propose to teach you about real estate and not tell you how to evaluate it?  Real estate, or any investment for that matter, is ALL about the numbers. The numbers it does include are so basic, anyone who tried to buy an apartment complex or commercial property using them would be slaughtered 
 Ah, Pierre, you lusty Frenchman, where do you go wrong? Actually the main character Pierre is an American in the early 19th century who is well-off leading an easy life, until suddenly a mysterious woman crosses his path, who happens to be his sister, that he has rather strong feelings for, not to mention the creepy way he calls his mother sister in the early part of the book. Overly dramatic, it reads as if Melville made it up as he wrote, since so many crucial facts and events are suddenly mentioned with no foreshadowing or even hint of them. It does have a brief amusing chapter that attacks critics as people who praise medicore writers that risk nothing. Melville desperately wants Pierre to be like Shakespeare's Hamlet, butt alas, Pierre is much too flat and shallow for that. Aside from Melville Scholars, this novel isn't worth serious reading and skimming a few chapters would demonstrate it's many problems. Go for "Moby-Dick" or "Bartleby the Scrivner" for a real sense of Melville's writing 
 Although I agree with Mr. Arnold's ultimate conclusion and found his demographic research useful, it should be apparent now that the increase in the DJIA, which the author asserted "must happen," has not materialized.  Where has all the money gone?  Another new bubble has been created- this time in real estate.  I suggest digging your financial foxhole now 
 In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents.  The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.  There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle:  no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of  WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason) 
 Someone gave me this  book when I became pregnant with my  first child  at  age 34.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  This book does absolutely NOTHING to settle the mind of a woman of "advanced maternal age." Get "What to Expect When You're Expecting" instead.  It's gentle and encouraging and most of the info  applies to expectant moms of all ages 
 Here's the thing -- I wanted to learn the story of Isolde and that is why I picked up this book in the first place.  I have read one other Miles book (I, Elizabeth) and that wasn't very impressive but I thought I'd give Isolde a try.  It was painful!  Miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly.  Her characters are very poorly developed.  Also, the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking, 'Wait!  Where the heck did that come from?'  After reading this book, I couldn't decide if I was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak, unskilled writing.  
 I was thoroughly disappointed in this book, which I found to be a dull recitation of facts.  The author has little interest in the artistic side of Rodgers, which is--I presume--the reason why we would want to know more about him in the first place.  I have a huge shelf of musical theater books, but this one isn't going to end up there 
 This guy is hyped by DG to gain entracne into Chinese market. Either he does not know the reportoir, or he is faking.  I give minus five, that is -5, for listening experience and -100 for spending money. Stay away from this dude. DG is trying to make money of a bogus guy.  Sound is no good when playing by CSO under outgoing Barenboim is worthless 
 This product is not worth the money.  It does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money.  Beware of products that only make money for the inventor 
 The metal side arms that the drawer slides down on were binding and need some lubrication. Somewhat flimsy. I do not expect it to last long. Nice concept, but I wish they had used better materials 
 Jim Hightower has become another spokesman for the unhappy left. This limousine liberal who lives in Texas and poses blue collar, is now complaining about "trailer trash rednecks" who have taken his country from him. Since when was this Hightower's country? Yet so many misguided people are giving this book four or five star reviews. Why does this even deserve one star? Just like all the other liberal socialists, Hightower complains about dog-eat-dog economic corporations, the religious right, and capitalism. He has decided not to support Bush in the war on terrorism against Osama bin Laden, Zarkawi and his evil thugs. How dare he do such a thing.  And second, who has stolen this country. NO ONE! I am sick of people saying that Bush stole the election. Rubbish! Bush may have not won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but he won the electoral vote. Gore may have won the popular vote but he did not win the electoral vote. The presidential candidate who wins the electoral vote wins the election. That is what our founding fathers decided. Bush did not steal the election.   And about the Republican-controlled Congress. Congress is ruled by Republicans not because they stole their way there. But because they were elected by the people. The American people decided to elect Republicans in Congress. There is no way that the Republicans have stolen the government. It's nonsense!   Please take my advice and don't waste your money on this trashy book. Go to college and get an education in political science. I would only buy this book if I wanted something to destroy. But I would not buy this book because I am not giving Jim Hightower one cent of my money. And also because this book is not worth one cent of my money.   
 I don't think you can really write a book to teach someone to be funny.  Fortunately the author does not even attempt that task.  Judy talks a lot on the structure of jokes and setting up punch lines.  I guess I have a hard time buying into this cookie cutter approach of humor.  I have not yet read her latest book so I can't speak to that but I would not recommend buying this book 
 It's hard not to love the idea of this book, just as it is easy to hate marred execution. A fascinating botch job, but still a botch.  As seems to be the case with the authors of many social histories, Kuh is so enamored with the fact that he got to this idea first--and it is a "why-didn't-I-think-of-that? one--that he inserts his story into the mix; in this case, he'd like to see a parallel to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist--but he ain't Joyce, and clearly isn't much of a cook. He's a great hypocrite, however: I found it hilarious that a guy critiquing culinary elitism continuously throws out french dishes without translating or providing an explanation of the dish. You will be amazed at how little discussion of food there is in here.  I won't dwell on the grammatical errors or preening prose--other reviews have--but I will say that the most dishearterning aspect of the book is the author's inability to get over himself, which severely limits his coverage. Clearly, he's not good enough of a writer or thinker to understand his own bias--because he fetishizes the past; makes his time in the kitchen (60s and 70s) to be the most important era in food history (of course!); and then tries to act like a distant, objective journalist for the present, treating it like clinical, lifeless business. This supposed distance kills the book's intent: instead of tracing the evolution of the American restaurant, he ends up lionizing the past and trashing the last twenty years of professional cooking, which get few pages and absolutely no discussion about the food produced. It's remarkable, given all that has transpired in the last 15 years, that he spends no energy on the fact that America is the culinary center of the world, yet can come back to talk about Henri Soule again and again.  The book you're looking for has not been written yet 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 Just finished this read and I am still wondering why.  It started out well enough; the story idea was original and interesting, but I should have figured it out when the "Indiana Jones stuff" started. The writing FOR THESE EXCITING PARTS WERE BIT OVERDONE!!!!  And then we are back to normal again, NO WAIT!  SOMETHING EVEN MORE EXCITING AND LESS PROBABLE IS HAPPENING NOW!!!!  Anyhow, I felt my 8th grader could have probably written this book.  So I had nothing more to read and I continued.  I should have stopped, because as you know if you have read the other reviews... the Davinci Code junk started.  What a load!  Jesus is now gay?  Couldn't come up with a variation of those gnostic views huh?  So lets make some stuff up and cause a controversy so we can sell books.  I really hate to tell you Mr. Reilly but thats not a new idea either. Very low quality read, in other words don't waste the time reading this when you can watch paint dry, water boil, or even watch a cake bake.  And if you are a late night reader as I am you would be better off going to sleep 
 I really want to like this music, but it's so formulaic and soulless. The vocals are stiffened by some forced folksiness, and the lyrics are repetitive and empty. They sound like hipster guys playing old-country dressup, like protected, untorn hearts going for broken and battle-scarred (I don't know for a fact that these guys haven't been through the things that so often make great country music, I'm just saying that this is what their music sounds like). 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version 
 A dilemma suggests two views, a situation where a difficult choice must be made.  The author presents only one view.  Over and over again she tells stories of unhappy adults who were paralyzed by the gifted label and the experience of being pushed by extreme parents.  While I believe these stories and pain are genuine, I cannot understand why Ms. Quart does not speak of other adults who have thrived, those who look back fondly on their gifted education and the enrichments their parents offered. She mentions the current Spelling Bee pronouncer and former champion, Jacques Bailly. In other venues Bailly has frequently spoken how much he believes in academic competition and how much he enjoyed the experience as a child. But here Bailly is only quoted when he registers a complaint.   Stories of positive experiences never are mentioned.  The balance would have made this book live up to the subtitle.  The crucial flaw of the book is that Ms. Quart completely misses the point about gifted children. She speaks of giftedness as something forced on children (or as a classification "bought" by wealthy families.).  Anyone who spends time with a truly gifted child knows that the push comes from the child. No parents of a gifted child would ever credit the Baby Einstein videos for their child's intellectual curiousity.    And gifted children do ask for academic pre-schools and weekly trips to the museum, and very much enjoy spending hours in a small room being quizzed by an adult. (This may not be a good thing, but it is a real thing.)    I expected the book to examine the actual dilemma parents face--how much should the parent nurture the child's requests, and how much should the children be encouraged to "just go out and play"  even though they resist?  By dismissing the key element of the child's desires in this equation, Ms. Quart eliminates any value to her argument.    This book does nothing to help gifted children, nor to guide their parents or teachers. 
 After receiving the item I installed it in my Explorer and gave it a test run while out Christmas shopping. The picture quality on the main unit was outstanding, however the other monitor had distortion and what looked to be signal problems. I returned the item and received another from Amazon, Kudos to Amazon for being so fast with the replacement. I installed the second item, and had the same problems. Needless to say we returned that one too and went with a different DVD player 
 I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these 
 Mr Klein comes across as a spoiled sofisticate. He berates the cruise industry using little or no facts, just supposition and his own opinion. I have enjoyed cruising in the past and thought I would learn something damning about the industry, but only learned Mr Klein apparently had a bad experience while on a cruise and must now take out his frustrations on the entire cruise line industry. If you want to read complaints about cruising, look online for a cruise blog and save your money 
 ...I'm giving this a 1 star because Elder is simply not a Libertarian. He should stop masquerading because most of us Libertarians don't subscribe to most of his far-right rantings. Larry, for someone who is so focused on proving yourself to black America, you still haven't had the guts to refer to yourself as a black Conservativ 
 I ordered this item some time ago and have not received the book.  
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 Although this may be a good marketing book for writers, I found the lack of professional typesetting bothersome: using lines of hyphens between entries, instead of subject headers or bullets; using bold AND italics for book titles are just a few problems. But the biggest error is that there is no index in the back of the book. A book such as this begs for a lengthy index of author's names, subject headers, book titles, etc. I found it frustrating trying to navigate through this hodge podge of advice. 
 Since Arthur Hailey had his book "Airport" published which was later made into a movie in 1970, it became successful. The sequels that followed: Airport 1975 (1974) and Airport '77 (1977) did not have that big of a success, though the former fared better at the box office. I was not really that impressed with the latter in scientific terms. The plane crashes at sea and sinks to the bottom when only the forward cargo hold flooded. There was plenty of air inside the rest of the plane that, in reality, could keep it afloat for as long as it was available. The characters, like Airport 1975, overacted as well. Karen Wallace (Lee Grant) was an obnoxious alcoholic who was constantly rude to husband Martin Wallace (Christopher Lee) a professional scuba diver who drowns while accompanying Captain Don Gallagher (Jack Lemmon) to the surface to send out a mayday signal. She goes nuts and tries to open a door before she is subdued and kayoed by first stewardess and girlfriend of Gallagher, Eve Clayton (Brenda Vaccaro). There have been some sequels in the past that have meaning, but most are a waste of a movie watcher's time 
 This is a very bad book once you get past your self-conscious fear that you are missing something--I would say an alarmingly bad book: one has to wonder why this manuscript was submitted, and if submitted, not edited. This turns into a repetition of the allusive and graceful, for sure,  but unsubstantiated shtick of the by-now facile co-mingling of forms and genres, made even weaker by a lack of discipline to corral digressive discursions and courage to present arguments in at least occassionally straightforward logical presentation--this is all riffing on material we've seen before and it repeats and repeats and repeats itself. Yes, we can treat "Yahweh" as a purely literary-textual rather than an embedded national-cultic figure whose text was never naked and whose narrative was never uninstantiated in an actual religious-national culture (itself progentive but not, as a culture, textual-canonical), and compare this to the figure of "Jesus Christ as God" and then, propose a Gnostic trope of Yahweh's self-shrinkage in internally distancing (and neurotic) "zimzum."  Presumably we could also describe quantum mechanics in a poetical fashion and discourse freely on the feline qualities of Schrodinger bifurcated cattiness vis a vis the solid roundness of Newtonian physical matter--except we would be missing what was substantive and unique about the actual subject matter.   I will let Christians decide whether the oft-repeated and repeated remark that Jesus Christ is not Yahweh is meaningful or provocative for them; as a semi-agnostic Jew I would agree that Christianity has not supplanted Judaism and that Judaism will and must always attempt to define itself on its own terms. Still, I must wonder what this observation, when it comes for the second, fifth, and tenth time, actually tells us about the plurality of Second Commonwealth Judaisms, the full Gestalt of "Yahwehism" throughout patriarchal, Rabbinic, and mystical literature, or, indeed, the "Jewishness" of classic Christian doctrinal claims in an age where very Orthodox Jews (who do, it is true, practice the Law) now freely confess to belief in a dead Messiah, who will be resurrected, and who, many declare, is "the essence of God in a body".  Moreover, the second-and-third hand derived picture of kabbalah, most particularly the poetical post-Kafkaesque elaboration on the meaning and emotional import of "Yahweh's" zimzum is a debilitatedly reductionist and misleading summation for the reader of the contextual placement and import of zimzum and shvirat keliim within the rich panoply of inter-related Lurianic symbology as understood through its oral and written expositors. Just as Hamlet really is not Yeshua and Bloom's Yahweh is an over-familiarized and sized down version of the theophononic and hieraphantic Yahweh-Adonoi-El of Jewish tradition and practice, so is his Yahweh of zimzum an over angst-compressed shoebox size misimpression of the Divine Structure of actual Lurianic kabbalah 
 Washington Post reporter and editor Joel Garreau's Radical Evolution could have been a good introduction to the debate over the future of humanity once the inevitable technological and knowledge explosion known by its prophets as the Singularity occurs. Instead, it's an unconsciously one-sided view of the near and middle future that ignores the more intriguing aspects of the debate.  His starting point is what he calls The Curve, a supposedly looming transcendent upswing in technological and biotechnical achievement that will change human existence in unprecedented ways within the next few decades. The Curve will be a step of a far greater and different type than any we have experienced before, even the major transformations which followed the introductions of the car, the airplane, atomic power and weaponry, the space age, and the Internet.  Garreau first takes a look at what he calls the Heaven scenario, made famous in futurist circles by sf writer Vernor Vinge and inventor Ray Kurzweil. This is the view that the soon-to-appear Curve is Vinge's Singularity, an event that will make us all gods: physically perfect (if we choose to retain physical bodies at all, which will be gauche and unnecessary when we can simply be uploaded as computer software and thus freed from the unpleasantness and messiness of physical existence); practically immortal; and unconstrained by energy requirements from pursuing any endeavor we might want to. This is the glowing Singularity known disparagingly as the Rapture of the Nerds by its doubters.  Garreau interviewed Kurzweil extensively for this book. The most valuable parts of the book are what important figures such as Kurzweil, Bill Joy, and Francis Fukuyama have to say. The problem is that the reader has to cut through a lot of Garreau to get to a little Kurzweil. Garreau himself (his travel ordeals reaching his subjects, where and what he ate and drank on his travels, his opinions on DDT and nuclear fission, and other ramblings) is by far the major personality in the book - an odd choice for a reporter to make.  Garreau next considers the Hell scenario, for an exposition of which he turns to Sun Microsystems former chief scientist Bill Joy, who has made himself wildly unpopular in futurist circles by expressing fears about soon-to-happen Curve-inspired developments such as genetically engineered diseases targeted at specific races or groups, etc. Joy is portrayed as a prophet of doom whose negativity is just as simplistic and wrongheaded as Kurzweil's futurist cheerleading.  So having scorned the too hot and too cold porridges, Garreau turns to the just right one: the Prevail scenario, which involves a soft landing by humanity on the new technologies.  Garreau takes the purple giraffe approach to the debate over The Curve. He first dismisses the exorbitant claims of the purple giraffes' rabid partisans who claim that all our problems will magically disappear once the purple giraffes arrive here. He then looks at the claims of those who would demonize the purple giraffes and who are frantically warning the rest of us about the terrors that the reign of the giraffes will bring. Garreau finds this approach equally one-sided.  So with an air of smug self-congratulation over his Solomonic wisdom, his reasonable Middle Way, his gift for seeing both sides of an issue which most of the rest of us lack, Garreau concludes that the giraffes' arrival won't mean either Heaven or Hell. Sure, they will change everything radically once they get here - ands that will be soon - but we'll muddle through. Problem solved.  Of course, the real question is about the (probably fictitious) giraffes, not about their effects. That's why I say Garreau has missed the more intriguing aspects of the debate. For example, not once in the book proper is Roger Penrose mentioned. There is one brief reference to him in the "For Further Reading" bibliography that follows the book, and that is all. This a glaring omission that grates on anyone who is passingly familiar with futurist issues, but whose absence is probably not noticed by newcomers to these issues. I feel such newcomers have been poorly served by Garreau's book and will gain from it a misleading impression of the status of The Curve, and of computer consciouness and "uploading" of people to software, in genuine scientific circles.  The only very brief consideration which Garreau pays to the idea that we may still simply be in the middle of an era of continual, churning change (as we always have been), instead of on the cusp of an explosion of a different type of change than we have ever known before, is when he walks around a symposium in Boston and asks attendees why some of them might not be believers in the imminence of The Curve (Garreau's capital letters). When he doesn't receive any knock-down arguments against The Curve, he concludes that his, and the Heaven, Hell, and Prevail proponents' beliefs in it, are beyond question.  This is of course completely backward and unscientific. It is essentially impossible to actively disprove all possible hypotheses one at a time. That is why the burden of proof in scientific circles has always rested on those making the new claims, not on those who are not making them. And the more unprecedented the claims, the heavier the burden of proof is. It's impossible to prove that the purple giraffes don't exist or aren't coming. But you can't conclude from their doubters' inability to disprove them that they're on their way here.  There are many, many flaws in Garreau's writing and reasoning, such as it is. He constantly interjects himself into the story, which is distracting as well as boring. Who really needs to hear about the details of his interviews with his famous subjects? The point is what they have to say, not where they said it or how many layovers Garreau had on his flight to meet them.  The book is permeated with Garreau's aging hippy sensibilities. He quotes from the Whole Earth catalog. He speaks with approval of the Rachel Carson-inspired ban on DDT (a senselessly tragic ban which has killed more human beings than all the dictators throughout history have managed to do). He speaks with fearful hippy horror about nuclear energy, the irrational fear of which has condemned billions to live in poverty and squalor. If he is going to get all of his scientific opinions from the popular culture, I wish he would expose himself to Steven Milloy, Michael Crichton, Roger Penrose, and the more sensible French environmental movement, which correctly sees nuclear energy as the Greenest alternative energy source.  One example of his poor reasoning should suffice: "To get from the formation of the Earth to the first muticellular organisms took perhaps 4 billion years. Getting from tiny organisms to the first mammals took 400 million years. Getting from mammals to the first primitive monkeys took 150 million years. Getting from monkeys to hominid species such as chimpanzees took something like 30 million years. Notice how the pace accelerates?"  But the "pace" hasn't necessarily accelerated if the size of the steps varies greatly. Garreau's landmarks are arbitrary ones, not carefully calibrated equidistant ones. Most scientists, and probably most people on the street, would see the jump from tiny organisms to mammals to be far, far greater than the jump from monkeys to hominids. So the fact that the one step took 400 million years and the other took 30 million years might actually represent a great decrease in the pace of evolution. Or maybe not. But the point is that Garreau tries to interject a mathematical calculation of rate of change to a magazine-quiz style sequence of events.  Garreau misses the chance to really explore the interesting questions of what a new humanity might mean. Religion gets a very brief mention in the last chapter, in the form of some mystical references to Teilhard de Chardin. On the psychological side Garreau does dutifully cite the point that many make that computer consciousness and uploading seem to be an idea whose popularity peaks with men in their 50s, who always put the onset of this new era within the next 20 years (thus granting them immortality). But he doesn't really follow up on this point, or on how the wish may be father to the thought.  He speaks with people who are clearly misfits and partial failures on the human, social level, who clearly have an unhealthy hatred of their own physical beings, but he accepts their "everyone will be on an equal software footing in the future" views as being rational rather than emotional, antihuman rejections of our actual existences in favor of some sterile life as software.  Skip this one unless you already have enough of a background on the subject not to be in danger of being misled by Garreau's biases and omissions. And even then, just skim this for the money quotes from the principals themselves 
 The publishers of this CD are being blatantly DISHONEST. The CD claims to be the AUDIO Unlimited Power and even includes a statement about it being narrated by Anthony Robbins.   Yet the CD is NOT AN AUDIO VERSION OF THE BOOK. It is simply a recording of Mr Robbins presenting 50 minutes of material at a seminar.   Only in small letters at the back of the CD does it say "abridged version".   Avoid the CD. Just buy and read the book. 
 Mr. Segev has written yet another history of Israel.  THis time the topic is Israels first year in existence.  He touches on such topics as; secularism vs. religion, settling the territories, arab lands, immigration.  His argument is simple.  THe Jews, having defeated the Arab in the 48 war, treat their neighboors badly while at the same time creating a theocratic state and encouraging Jews(who according to him were living peacefully with their arab neighboors) to emigrate to Israel.  This book is very informative and well written but its argument is wrong.  For a less biased account I would recommend "From time immemorial".  For an account of the war read 'O Jerusaleum'.  Segev does no justice to the heroics of the early Jews who built a strong state in the face of enemies, but he does try and substantiate Arab claims that they were forced off their lands(after murdering thier Jewish neighboors of course).  Be careful with this book it is biased 
 Buying this DeLonghi deep fryer  has turned out to be our worst online shopping experience. We bought it in fall 2006. It broke down and started to spill oil after several usages. We took it to the DeLonghi's local service in Chicago, which looked more like a trading place for stolen goods. DeLonghi has basically subcontracted its service in whole Chicago area to a rundown and out-of-times local repairing shop. That was in mid-January. Now it is early April and not surprisingly we still wait to hear from the service. Our repeated calls to the local service and the DeLonghi did not produce any results. Obviously,DeLonghi, which is based in Italy, has a very unreliable and inefficient network in the USA. If you live in the USA and has a malfunctioning DeLonghi product, expect for the worst. DeLonghi is not a trustworthy brand here. 
 frst of all i kno nothin bout this magazine but wen i came across readin this kids review sayin tat yayos nd jeezys cd were garbage forced me to write a review...frst of all yayos cd has at least 4 hits on it.. - So Seductive - Eastside Westside - Pimpin  - Curious - I Know You Don't Love Me - Live By the Gun And for Jeezy's album i admit there wasnt as many hits if any but the cd was one of the best albums tat came out this year w/ a new flow of southern rap and a lot of good songs....Trapstar..My Hood..Bang Ft T.I....Thug Motivation....And Then What...all good songs...im not sayin Jeezy is one of the best rappers or at the top not close..but if he comes up w/ a new album better than Thug Motivation 101 he will be up thea cuz of his new flow of souther rap and high energ 
 but come on...there's not ONE David Lynch film here, not ONE John Waters film here, not ONE film by the Cohen Brothers, and, where's films like FAT GUY GOES NUTZOID or BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA?  Where's the movies from the Big Dwarf Rodeo?  Ok, I suppose, if you've got the scratch to drop, and the hours upon hours to spend to watch some of these hacknied movies, then knock yourself out.  
 I don't need "MISFITS" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 If I had known, I wouldn't have purchased this book.  The only good thing I found were the pictures of the Masters and diagrams of hand positions.   There are better books on Reiki than this one 
 Yeah, there is a lot wrong in America; the powerful do take advantage of the weak. I would have liked some perspective though rather than just a whining account.    Bob Herbert can do better than this. It sounds like a disgruntled Co-op board. Since the issues are much more serious an attempt at integrating the problem or recounting it with what should happen in America would be in order. The question begs, "Is America all in our minds? 
 Dr. Gullo has quite a few good ideas here.  My problem is, #1, most of them are already in "Thin Tastes Better"; and #2, the book is blatantly padded, which drives me nuts. The useful material could be condensed down to about 30 pages -- so, to make the book long enough, he repeats every idea about 30 times.  He mentions the GG Bran Crispbread on literally every page... which brings me to annoyance #3:  as other reviewers have suggested, most of his recommended foods are nearly impossible to find.  Absolutely NO ONE in my area carries the bran crispbread; I finally mail-ordered some, only to discover that it's barely edible -- it tastes like thin sheets of wood.  It's bearable if topped with something, but really awful eaten plain.  Take my advice and forget about it -- just get yourself some Ry-Krisp, Finn Crisp or even reduced-fat Triscuits (my staple!).  I finally found Fage yogurt, and it's very expensive ($1.99 for an individual 7-8 oz. cup) -- AND it's only available in either fat-free (which I don't like) or very high fat (250 calories per 8 oz).  I did find Walden Farms salad dressings, but when I saw that they're labeled "Calorie Free," I decided they would probably be vile-tasting and put them back on the shelf.  I also found Vitamuffins, but if you read the ingredient lists, they are NOT particularly healthy:  the top three ingredients in their "Cran-Bran Muffins" are water, sugar, and white flour!  Bran is way down the list, and the fiber content is not high.  So I didn't buy those either.  I was glad to know that Alba shakes are still being made, although again, you have to mail-order them.    Dr. G. does have good behavior modification suggestions.  I think he's absolutely on the money about "trigger foods" and always carrying a snack pack with you.  But again, I believe all of that is in "Thin Tastes Better." 
 This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once.  If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book.  Contrived "in the nick of time" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke 
 Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment 
 I actually bought this book thinking it would be helpful, but all the info is in the online documents!!! The book isn't even advanced. It shows you how to do simple things, nothing advanced. This book is useless now. Just read the online documents, and download the sample code 
 I was dissapointed in the accuracy of information in "The Enycyclopedia of TV Game Shows".  While the selection of photos from Schwartz's and Wostbrock personal collection is nice; the inaccurate information is something else.  "Sale of the Century" is one page with such misinformation; many other entries have inaccurate information as well.  Well the effort is nice; I'm afraid the authors need to leave with some nice parting gifts 
 Note: If I could give this 0 stars, I would  I picked up this book on the strength of the high recommendations listed here - I guess I should have looked at the fact that there were only (5) reviews.  This book was trite, un-even, and just plain ridiculous.  It started out with a decent enough premise but did nothing to really build the relationship between the hero and heroine.  Maggie came off as a young, naive, totally unrealistic, "I'm trying to be cute & pert" but, I'm not.  It's almost as if the character "Ally McBeal" were thrust into a book.  The plot veered off in directions that didn't get tied up and the Hero, Connor, seemed to be spouting lines because that's what he was supposed to say rather than what he felt.    Also, there wasn't too much of anything that was daring in this book.  Just Ugghhh!  I feel sad that I dared to buy this.  Just run the other way - get something by Gaelen Foley (The Duke) or Lisa Kleypas (Dreaming of You) instea 
 THIS WATCH DOES NOT WORK ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL. I HAVE TRYED TO GET IT TO WORK ABOUT 75 TIMES, MY WIFE HAS TRYED ABOUT AT LEAST 25-30 TIMES, AND I TOOK IT TO A JEWLER AND EVEN HE COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK. THIS WATCH IS A PIECE OF JUN 
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 Don't invest your money. The content of this book is very intermittent 
 This movies rates right up there with "Schindler's List" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda.  Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making "Gettysburg," and the even better "Gods and Generals."  If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch "Gods and Generals" or "Gone With The Wind," and stay away from movie garbage like "Andersonville."    Also watch for the extended version DVD of "Gods and Generals" coming for the Christmas season of 2005. 
 While I very much understand what Penny Patterson has accomplished in her research over the years with Koko this movie was just a little to dated for me. I would have liked to see this in an updated form including new footage with her and Koko now as opposed to them together in the late 70's living in a trailer with Penny yelling no at Koko every 10 seconds.  The thing that really affected me with this movie was what passed for a Zoo back in 1978. 
 Though I do share similar beliefs in a lot of what Dr. Grof concludes, he leaves a lot more room for debate than need be. There are many metaphysical topics he touches upon that may seem a bit "out there" for many (i.e. past lives, living archetypes, out-of-body experiences, etc.) and yet he offers little to back-up what he says.   The problem is that this particular book is more like an overview than a careful and thorough analysis of the mind. Dr. Grof only provides anecdotal evidence and cursory summations of research and studies to justify his conclusions. A lot of the material comes from his own experiences and that of his patients. This is not enough to sway me intellectually and not what I expected from a book that presents itself within a scientific context. If this were entitled "Chicken Soup for the Holotropic Mind," I probably wouldn't feel as disappointed. Ah, well.. 
 It is so sad to wee these young women confuse body image with self image. They do not realize playboy exploit them (or their bodies) 
 This book is most certainly among the most distorted works that purport to be an unbiased discourse on gender issues. Allan Johnson has contrived page after page of anti-men rhetoric that renders the book a pure work of fiction. How can someone be so self-hating? It is beyond me. Johnson needs to take a huge step back and realize that not everything male is horrible and that not everything female if benevolent and good. How about a BALANCED work on gender issues? I suspect that won't be coming anytime soon from Allan Johnson 
 I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed.  My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas.  I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.  Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best.  People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable 
 This battery is NOT compatible with the the JVC-GRD270US video camera.  I did get a purchase price refund, but I am out shipping costs both ways 
 I was born too late to remember Tab Hunter's heyday, although I was around for the later generation of teen idols. I've always been interested in the star making machinery and also wondered what happens after stardom fades; I'd also read the recent Henry Willson bio and thought this would be an interesting compliment.   Mostly, I found the book to be a disappointment. It's oddly truncated in places (esp. the last two decades of Hunter's life) and I had to look at the cover to remind myself that this was an "as told to". The writing is filled with cliches, wooden prose, and hipster talk from bygone decades. One expects better from the presence of a professional writer. Celebrity bios and autobios usually aren't great literature, but they can have insight, lively prose and create interest even for humdrum lives. The reason for the odd shape of the narrative comes at the end. Someone was planning to do a tell-all scandal book about Hunter and, understandably, he wanted to counter it. As a result, we get a recap of the "Confidential" scandal (and Hunter's side of it) and periodically see unflattering events in Hunter's personal life (e.g., the pick-up he asked to watch his house and dogs who subsequently sold off his antiques and later sent post cards from various exotic destinations). OTOH, we don't get much depth about how Hunter came to terms with his sexuality or even his Hollywood decline. He sems to have developed sense of humor about being a "once been" (as reflected in his co-starring role with Divine), but he also seems to delight in name dropping and clearly continued to be a social climber well after his celebrity status had faded. Hunter wants us to see him as a horseman and a "regular" guy, but someone like that wouldn't be carrying on sexual ambiguous relationships with Harry Cohn's widow.   In many ways, important poieces of Hunter's life seem missing. We never get much explanation for his mother's breakdown or how she managed afterward. He speaks fondly of his brother and making occasional contributions to his widow and children, but it seems like he has little real contact with them and the grandchildren's appearence at his mother's funeral seems an afterthought. The most recent years of his life seem puzzling--no sustained sort of income, yet he seems to live relatively well. His partner isn't a major mogul, so you wonder what his source of income might be. There are various places where Hunter suggests that, in his younger days, his personal life was rather indiscreet and lacking in judgment (to be polite), yet it's not clear how that changed or how really put himself together. The book might have been more entertaining with more "dish" and more scandalous details, but even without that, we could gotten a better picture of who he was. Without the scandal of the 50s, the interest in closeted gay stars, and the legions of once-young fans, this would probably have quickly joined Marilu Henner's autobio in the remainder bin (where it belongs) 
 I can understand how people have different tastes.  I can understand how people with no taste still have preferences. But I honestly cannot understand how ANYONE could like this.   The music is like that of William Shatner, while the spoken word vocals reminded me of the narration that led into commercial breaks on the old Dukes of Hazzard TV show.  This guy is a redneck in full self-parody mode, trying to be a beatnik.  As I listened, my first instinct was to eject it from my car stereo and throw it out the window.  Then I thought about giving it away, but I was afraid of insulting anyone I'd give it too.  Out the window it went.  I honestly believe any positive review must be coming from either Ben under an alias or a record company plant.  It is impossible to like this garbage 
 I tried to stay with this book to the end, but alas, I tossed it with only about 20 pages left.  By this time the plot had become so byzantine that I no longer cared who did what.  Furthermore, I was getting pretty sick and tired of the sophomoric and unrealistically  silly dialog that ran all through the book.  The relationship between Moon and the FBI lady, for instance, was like something out of a novel for teenagers.  In other words, the book lacked credibility.  Doss falls short, I'm afraid, of even a mediocre Hillerman book. Hillerman weaves in the rich and mystical lore of the Indian culture quite effectively.  His dialog is pitch perfect, not contrived, as in this book.   And, as another reviewer noted, I was put off by Doss's maddening habit of witholding clues and information through the book.  I was looking forward to a good read, but all in all, it turned out to be a very flawed book 
 John Haught's concern, in his book "Deeper than Darwin" to convince us that science and religion cannot only co-exist, but can co-exist without relegating either the former or the latter to second chair.   He tries to explain this by arguing that the two may well simply be interpretations of the world 'on different levels.' To show how 'different levels' of interpretation are possible, he resorts to metaphor. Just like social issues can be explained in terms of psychology, economics, politics, biology, etc. (each interpretation being right on its own level of explanation) he agues that science and religion can also do this.   But this is where Haught's coherence ends. Nowhere does he give much of an explanation as to what the "deeper" level that religion supposedly gets to. Nowehere does he address the question of how, as the Bible (and other holy books) make historical predictions that can be checked by science (many already disproven), the two are not at odds.  What's more, Haught gives no reason to suppose that religion occupying a "deeper" realm than science is anything short of the kind of Gouldian "non-overlapping mysteria" he writes so sternly against! If he means something different, he never made it explicit in the book. We are constantly left guessing what "deeper" might actually mean.   Lastly, Haught seems to resort a decent amount to the "god of the gaps" idea that he, again, rails so much agianst in the Intelligent Design movement. Science hasn't explained x, he exclaims, and might not be able to. Therefore, religion should supplant science here. But that is EXACTLY what ID is.   In brief, this book needs to be rethought. The ideas need to be presented more explicitly (rather than every paragraph seeming to be a rehash of the one that came before). Haught never quite gets to the point and (maybe) because of that, fails to offer anything convincing; his only offer is poetic prose. 
 As one who's studied the Mountain Meadows Massacre and other aspects of the Old West, I like a good yarn as much as anyone. This book, however, was a disappointment. Author Sally Denton kept her readership on a short leash and never let anything get in the way of trashing the Mormon church. While other authors kept away from the fraudulent lead tablet while its authenticity was in doubt, Denton showed her disdain by buying it hook, line and sinker.  This tragedy happened before the "Civil War" for goodness sake. Going after the Mormons now is kind of like going after the Israelis for attacking the Liberty back in 1968 -- even worse. No one's left alive who was living back then and there was plenty of animosity between the Mormons and the Yankees, and the Mormons and the emigrants. Californians, who could have kept their mouths shut, constantly threatened the Mormons. In 1862-63, Abraham Lincoln showed how easily he could have civilians murdered and their homes burned with hardly any backlash.  Mountain Meadows was not unprovoked, but it was inexcusable. The right people were never brought to justice and Brigham Young should have seen that they were. But I don't think Denton's animosity now is justified. With all the Southerners murdered by the Union, Mountain Meadows was totally insignificant in comparison.   
 Camps and Cottages has some nice photographs of interior home furnishings. What I didn't like about the book are several things. The pictures are repeated throughout the book. For the price of this book I want to see original pictures on each page. The use of small pictures, about 1" square is really difficult for the eye to see. Printing text over textured, colored pages is extremely difficult to read. Descriptions are given of various rooms with no pictures to match, causing the reader confusion. Some photographs are cut off, even though the description includes items not seen. Some of the photographs are out of focus 
 Kevin Trudeau leads his readers into believing they will get the solutions they are looking for but when the time for presenting them comes, he sends his readers to his website where they have to pay an outrageous membership fee. He condemns those who are out to make money at our expense then turns around does the same thing.  I give it two stars because there is some knowledge to be gained but no solution unless you are willing to pay.  A big disappointment 
 I purchased the Alex Watch for my 8 year old daughter as a gift from Santa.  The watch face has a small round purple piece that sits in the center of the wathch face where the small and long hands are positioned.  This piece came loose and is floating around the watch and jamming the hands.  So, the watch hands cannot move forward.  Frustrating and useless, since I cannot return it 
 I found this book to be just as confusing as Photoshop Elements.  I wanted step by step directions, starting with how to get the pictures from the camera into the program, and building to sophisticated projects.  I can't even follow this book to save my pictures in folders; what I've got is a mess!  After several frustrating hours, the book is now sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust, and I'm thinking about deleting Elements from my computer.  Sign me Disappointe 
 This author is an overeducated person who writes down all of her overwrought thoughts in the same rambling sequence, the same unedited chunks, just like real life, written down just the way she thinks them.  For me, this was unsatisfying, almost insulting.  I like writing to be edited, thoughts distilled.  Don't waste the reader's time.  Sure the thinking process itself can be interesting, but when it's interesting, it's because it's been  abstracted and refined from real thinking.    She could have written the same content in 60% less words, and that would have made better, kinder reading.    The author is also hyper self conscious of her status as a white, heterosexual, happily married, white collar, intellectual elite, and this gets tiresome because there is no humor sarcasm or self mockery.  I also found her ruminations on lesbians, single moms, "feminists" and unhappily married straight women to be patronizing, with her constant asides on how spoiled she must appear to these unfortunate unblessed women.  I stopped wanting to read her self congratulatory rants many times.    That she felt more comfortable at McDonalds ("the people") than at Whole Foods (the Elite) was farcial without meaning to be. What self indulgence.    It's clear this person has never suffered a true tragedy or serious life experience, and that is why she takes every trivial experience so seriously as though it is worth much more than it is.   Maybe I was disappointed because my expectations were so high, because someone I respect recommended this book 
 I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.  Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one.  The spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements.  In several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread "may or may not" mean some karmic element at play.  The whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define.  Therefore, when a card "may or may not" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you "may or may not" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.  Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity   It is difficult to have it both ways and I found working with these spreads difficult.  Imagine doing a Celtic Cross reading and the first position "may or may not" be the root of the issue.  These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader.  I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous. 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 I am researching Kundalini Shakti and thought this book may be of help. However, it soon became apparent that I had erred when the author stated that she had been instructed by 'higher beings', that the Aquarian age was forcing previously esoteric knowledge into the public domain, that the alignment of the planets would have some affect on my Kundalini and that I should indulge in free form dancing. The bulk of the text regarding Kundalini appeared little more that exercises in auto-suggestion and the actual chapter on how to release the Kundalini lacked precision. I could not recommend this to anyone seriously interested in Kundalin 
  Joe Camp should hang his head in shame for making this piece of trash. I assumed it would be good because he has made good clean family films before. This ain't one of them. This film has indecency in it and is not fit for family viewing. Don't waste your time or money 
 Let me cite just one example from The Truth Behind Left Behind that makes it a very weak defense of the Left Behind theology. There are many more, but there are space limitations. In Tim LaHaye's Introduction to TBLB, we read: "Jerry [Jenkins] and I have unashamedly taken the position that all prophecy should be interpreted literally whenever possible. We have been guided throughout by the golden rule of interpretation: When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense. Take every word at its primary, literal meaning unless the facts of the immediate context clearly indicate otherwise" (7). So shouldn't the reader interpret the weapons of Ezekiel 38-39--bows, arrows, shields, war clubs, spears, horses, and chariots--literally? Not according to our authors. Here's their interpretation from their chapter "The Coming Russian/Islamic Invasion": "Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Ezekiel spoke in language that the people of his day could understand. If he had spoken of MIG-29s, laser-fired missiles, tanks, and assault rifles, this text would have been nonsensical to everyone until the twentieth century" (47). Of course, this is question begging in the extreme. Why would the people in Ezekiel's day need to understand a prophecy if it wasn't meant for them? Why confuse them and us? How do Hitchcock, Ice, and LaHaye KNOW that this is what the Holy Spirit meant? Once the trio makes these ancient weapons of no consequence, they are free to create their own prophetic scenario that can't be tested because it all takes place after Christians are no longer here! Convenient. Consider their words: "The focus clearly is NOT the specific weapons that will be used by these invaders" (47). What happened to "literal interpretation"? The weapons may not be the passage's "focus," but they can't be dismissed as inconsequential to the narrative. The weapons are part of the story from beginning to end, and if taken literally would negate the future scenario outlined by the authors. They claim that Ezek. 38-39 has to be a DISTANT future battle because it takes place in the "latter years" (38:8) and the "last days" (38:16). Most biblical scholars, even some dispensationalists, would say that these two time expressions most often mean nothing more than "in the future" or "in the days to come." The same Hebrew phrase is translated as "the days to come" in Num. 24:14, which probably refers to David's victory over Moab. The prophecy of Deut. 31:29, where the same expression is used, came to pass in the period of the Judges (cf. 2:20-21). Here's how one Bible expositor explains it: "this expression does not refer to 'the latter days' (KJV, RSV) in the eschatological sense. . . , but rather to that portion of the future that falls within the scope of the speaker's perspective (cf. Gen. 49:1)." Then one has to wonder why the authors avoid interacting with Edwin M. Yamauchi's Foes of the Northern Frontier which refutes their historical, geographical, and lexographic arguments line by line, and it was written in 1982! Yamauchi is a noted expert on this subject. The Russian invasion premise is only one of the book's many problems. If readers are interested in this topic, I suggest that they pick up a copy of End Times Fiction: A Biblical Consideration of the Left Behind Theology written by me. Since Hitchcock and Ice refer to it several times, it would be helpful to read what they do not deal with 
 After viewing the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao I must agree with the March 10th, 2000 reviewer who states strongly that this is just a solid "B" film.  When I was growing up I spent many hours in movie theaters watching Fantasy and Sci-Fi films.  George Pal movies were always among my favorites and still are.  To make statements that the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao was George Pal's greatest film is unfounded.  Have these people ever watched the Time Machine or  War of the Worlds?   If we are talking about great Fantasy or Sci-Fi movies, which George Pal should be remembered for, then you don't get much better than these two.  The only credit to this film is the scene where Dr. Lao shows the town's people the movie clips of the Roman city being destroyed by a vocanic eruption.  The eruption scenes are taken from another George Pal classic fantasty film, Atlantis the Lost Continent.  Now there is a great film to entertain the children.  The only problem with Atlantis the Lost Continent is that for some unknown reason it has not yet been released on DVD.  For those of us out there that still enjoy great fantasy films from the past, drop the studio a line and lets get this one on the market 
 There is very likely some information in this book that is insightful and helpful, but I couldn't find it.   The book reads as if you are attending a seminar taught by someone who was _really_ excited, and who had drank way too much coffee. I was really interested in hearing about brand and the new economy the author envisioned, but the book is just too distracting to read. I "read" about 1/2 of it, and I'm not sure if there were more than three full sentences that I had found up until that point. Text changes color, size, boldness throughout. Liberal and nonsensical use of punctuation is infuriating after the first page.  The book reads like a spoken seminar, and squanders the opportunity of actually being a book, which could have afforded a more in-depth look at the authors ideas. I would highly discourage anyone serious about this topic from buying this book. It is more of a super-happy high school cheerleader dialog than any type of meaningful discussion 
 The author goes into detail about the Yin and Yang aspects of nature, describing Yin as outward moving and expansive, while Yang is described as being inward moving and contractive.  My boyfriend, who is studying Chinese medicine was reading the sample pages over my shoulder and was quick to point out that the author has these qualities exactly opposite of what they should be.  Yin is the feminine quality, inward and storing while Yang is the masculine quality, outward and depleting.  It's hard to believe that someone could make this mistake and actually get to print, but alas, they did.  FYI for all those who would care to know 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 My main complaint is that it is another misguided attack on the concept of the "Nobel Savage".  While I understand it is fashionable to do so in hopes of appearing appropriately "skeptical" and "realistic", it is, in fact, neither;  and I suggest such claims are both naive and anthropocentric.  A "realistic" analysis has to begin with a very basic principle of biology:  "Every organism is optimally expressed within the original environment that shaped it".  If you want to get an idea of what is an "optimally expressed" giraffe, for example, you don't look at the animal within a zoo environment ---rather you analyze its behavior within the original "wild environment" of that animal (its Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness ---E.E.A.).    Now it is naive and anthropocentric to imagine that the human animal is somehow different from every other organism existing on the planet.  As such, to obtain the optimal expression of the human animal, we must follow the same procedure.  One cannot look to our expression within the modern "zoo" in which we have now "contained" ourselves.  Instead, one must look to the "human wild environment" to gain this deeper understanding.  The E.E.A. of the human animal is defined by the hunter-gatherer nomadic extended families of Paleolithic times.  Thus, based the above foundational biological principle, that particular human expression within the E.E.A. must reasonably be defined as the "optimal hunter-gatherer" ---which is a simple rephrasing of the more popular term, the "Nobel Savage".  Even outside this analysis, it is readily apparent that all of us, presently, are "wilted flowers" in comparison to human animals who optimally "blossomed" within the environment that spawned them.  These original humans experienced the best developmental trajectory imaginable.  Every child grew up within an environment keyed to satisfying the very hard-wired needs that that same environment originally designed.    Like any animal growing up in a zoo (well-designed or not) the experience of a child growing up in the modern "human zoo" simply can't compare to the secure base of a non-dysfunctional extended nomadic family that prides itself on ending a child's tears usually within a few seconds (see chapter 8, "The Natural Child", within THE PALEOLITHIC PRESCRIPTION by Melvin Konner, et.al.).  And Pinker would somehow ignore that such a relatively "ideal" childhood developmnetal environment just might have an especially positive effect on the adult humans thereby produced?  Again, such a view, I maintain, is representative of a naive faith in our current "normality".  My cynicism is, contrariwise, that the modern human is so far removed from what is the optimal human expression that it is now almost hopeless to somehow find our way back.  It's very much as would happen if all the wild tigers were killed and we had to derive what is the optimal expression of that animal, artificially, from a survey of various zoos.  Could we ever re-create the original tiger in all its splendor outside the wild?  And, in turn, can we ever re-create the original optimal human expression, in all its splendor, outside the wild environment of the original savage --- The Nobel Savage?

 Don't get me wrong, occasionally there are issues I still read cover to cover, but it seems as though MJ has gone through a change lately.  Gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing.  Now the focus seems to be health, fitness and diet.  I used to buy Men's Health magazine for those topics.  If I wanted that focus I would continue to buy MH.  There is no longer a consistent reason to read MJ on a regular basis anymore.  Man, I miss the old MJ

 This book sends people out in the field with a GPS but without the knowledge of what  to do when the batteries die or the electronics fail (it happens!). If you really are a "dummy," you should also learn the basics of navigation before relying on an electronic device that can leave you stranded. Better choices that are very readable: The Land Navigation Handbook (new edition includes GPS info) and Wilderness Navigation (less detailed) 
 Although I have not read the entire book, The New Soldier, I have read what John Kerry is actually responsible for, i.e., his congressional testimmony (in it's entiirety) and the epilogue that he wrote for the book. Unless you have read the entire congressional testimony, includiing the question and answer session, it is impossible to determine where John Kerry and the other vets were coming from. It was a turbulent time. I was an Air Force Vietnam "era" vet and my brother did two tours in-country with the Army. Neither of are heroes. I know many guys from those days who served in Nam. I can tell you that there were two types of guys who went: the majority, who didn't want to be there in the first place; and those who were really gung ho and two weeks on the ground in-couuntry were asking themselves "What the *#*# was I thinking?" You also have to understand how other factors affected many of the vets who returned from the war. Ever heard of The Pentagon Papers? How about The Gulf of Tonkin Affair? These documents, compiled and analysed by a select few Pentagon insiders very close to MacNamara, with the highest clearance, were leaked by an ex Marine captain and trusted advisor by the name of Daniel Elsberg. He was responsible for much of the content of "The Papers". I challenge all of the nay-sayers to do some serious research on their own. Don't just buy into the gruel from either party. Also, I am seeing a lot of speculation about why this book is not widely available. Well, guess what? This coffee table picture book had a very limited printing in the first place. So, what would you expect after thirty-three years? Also, I have seen no actual evidence that Kerry had any control over the publishing of the book or profited from it in any way. I only have a suspicion that the fellow whose name also appears on the cover took some liberties with Kerry's name at a time when Kerry was the "talking head" for the movement.  I have another suspicion. Maybe this entire bru-ha-ha was started by someone who saw an opportunity to fleece a lot of eager idiologues who look for any way to trash Kerry.

 This book doesn't offer enough depth.  I felt that I could have gained more watching a "Dr.Phil" episode.  
 From my online review of the Vosko-ization of Rochester's Sacred Heart Cathedral:  The cathedral project was overseen by Fr. (or, variously, "Dr.") Richard Vosko, a collarless, suit-and-tie-wearing priest from the nearby diocese of Albany who claims "we need a new understanding of what religion is and what God is." He has raised the ire of many Catholics by bringing that "new understanding" to cathedrals in Detroit, Los Angeles, Nashville and Seattle.   Vosko and Clark claim the renovation brings Sacred Heart into conformity with "the current norms of the Roman Catholic Church." I presume they're talking about the "norms" set out in Environment and Art in Catholic Worship, a nonbinding pamphlet with no authority published by the Bishops' Committee on Liturgy in 1978 and never voted on by the bishops themselves.   The real norms are contained in the documents of Vatican II, specifically Sacrosanctum Concilium which states that "there must be no innovations unless the good of the Church genuinely and certainly requires them, and care must be taken that any new forms adopted should in some way grow organically from forms already existing."  
 This book presents repetitive fluffy pablum that appears to be a pathethetic attempt to please. It is a mercifully short exposition of  trivialities.   
 While the 'real' version of this movie, as shown on Cinemax and as sold in VHS, is about 90 minutes long, this DVD is only 71 minutes long.    Forget what the product description says, it is wrong! This is movie is a heavily edited version of Hotel Exotica with almost 20 minutes of footage cut!  Amazon should either stop selling this DVD or correct the information about it to say that it is NOT and uncut version and that it is only 71 minutes long.  
 Novocaine for the funny bone. I ordered this CD along with one by Andy Andrist, because Stanhope recommended them both. Well, apparently ol' Dougie had one too many Jï¿½germeisters that day, because, while Andrist is a flat-out hoot, this Barry guy doesn't even approach funny. His delivery is whiny and flat, and his material is occasionally amusing but that's about it. He'll have his own show on the Tee Vee someday, no doubt about it, along with the rest of the safe, marginally talented hacks who currently infest American airwaves.  If you like Bill Hicks, Lenny Bruce, or Stanhope, avoid this guy like a bad sitcom 
 Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there 
 This is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub-plots because there are none.  There is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie, so it makes for excellent escapism, which we all need now and then.  Since all the characters stay together, it is easy to follow along, so you can turn your brain off, it won't be needed.  Since it's all about the ship, acting wasn't necessary.  You can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of Russell and Dreyfus.  I felt pity for them as actors, and hope they can rebound.  The movie is shorter than most, so there will be minimum impact on your life.  You will remember nothing about it soon after exposure 
 This is much better than what used to be written on Hinduism in the West.  But Flood still has to travel some more distance. This book still speaks of  the Aryan invasions although archaeologists have abandoned that racist  theory

 The frontal wound was one of an EXIT not entry. No support for Dr Crenshaw from me 
 The premise of this plot is not bad, but the execution is labored and sometimes too off the wall. With a great starring cast it is a big disappointment 
 These earrings have no blue in them!  The picture is extremely deceiving 
 Although I enjoyed that the book seemed genuinely honest, it didn't mask the fact that the author was an arrogant and ultimately unsuitable wanna-be spy. Her prose was riddled with fake self-deprecation that was meant to cover up a smug attitude. It was no wonder she didn't get very far in her clandestine career. In fact, she exposes the agency's transgressions more by way of her own mistakes -- one wonders whether her supervisors would advise taking a friend along for a meeting with an agent, which the author does at one point in the book. It's also seemed pretty silly that she couldn't come up with better cover for herself that wouldn't leave random people at a party wondering about her "spooky-sounding government job." Since Moran seems to be relatively intelligent, one can only assume that she WANTED people to suspect her of being a spy, just to feel cool. Would you want someone like that actually being in the business of protecting this country? It's hard to believe that any of her friends/family were too terribly surprised when she finally DID "blow her cover."  Read the book for an insider's view, but don't be fooled into thinking it was too bad this author left her CIA career. 
 I listened to this as an audiobook.  This is the worst book I've ever listened to from Audible.  The worst.  The narration is just too, too cutesy sweet and the writing is junior high quality at best. Unfortunately, I keep hearing Emperor Franz Josef in Amadeus saying, "It has, well, too many notes."  Barr describes everything  (including clothes, hair, shoes, etc) with multiple metaphors, a plethora of adjectives, and, well, too many notes.  I kept yelling at the author to just shut up and tell the story.  I tried three times to listen to it and just wanted to scream after 10 minutes.  I've heard this woman read other books and quite liked them, but her voice and this story just don't add up to anything other than ear pain and a case of diabetes.  Where's Michael Connelly when you need him 
 Don't get me wrong... I do like d&b remixes and I love the art of  noise but this album is more noise then art.  When musicians rely on drum  machines to make their music sound 'cool' this is what happens.  There are  a couple of exceptions on this album such as opus4 & peter gunn which  must have taken effort and talent to create.  However for the bulk of the  rest of this album.... pllease! 
 It is shocking how poorly written and uninformative this book is.  I had purchased it after having seen it advertised in "The Barnes Review", a publication I had previously known to be thoughtful and scholarly.  My opinion has now been altered by this experience.  The writing of this book is so poor that it is difficult to discern in many cases the intent of large portions of the narrative.  It certainly does not represent what I had hoped for, a well researched and thoughtfully presented rendering of medieval European history.  The only thing useful in this book is the standalone chronology, which can be found at the end of the book.  Dates are important in the study of history.  But excellent writing skills are equally important for the communication of the great ideas and movements of history.  And the writing herein is truly terrible.  If you are searching for an excellent book on the topic of medieval Europe, I urge you to look elsewhere.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have wasted hard earned money on this book.  Addendum 07-Apr-05:  For any who are interested in this topic of a generalized history of Western Civilization, I can heartily recommend Hilaire Belloc's "Crisis of Civilization", which is also available from Amazon.  It is beautifully written and truly excellent 
 I have to say I bought this book hoping to find at least an ounce of truth in it.  I found none.  It was slanted and very unfair.  All the author does is dwell on the bad in no way remotley shows Van for the man he is.  It's a shame it was published while he is alive but is what I would expect from the RELIGOUS FANATICS TODAY, WHO ARE BY THE WAY HYPOCRITES~ Don't buy the book-get his DVD's and watch his films. Shame on you Ronald Davis, biggot 
 Martin endeavors to write a psychological portrait of John Dewey, but falls short. Ironically, the least developed aspect of Dewey's life in this volume is that of Dewey, the psychologist. Dewey was an early member (& president) of the American Psychological Assn. His observation of the reflex arc is still a staple of introductory psychology and the social psychological concepts and models he developed with George Herbert Mead and others prefigured much of the contemporary work in social cognition. Important figures in academic clinical psychology such as George Kelly and Seymour Sarason drew heavily on Dewey's work and Sarason has remained an important champion. No mention is made that Dewey's great friend, James McKeen Catell (a recurring, but little described figure in the book), was diametrically opposed to Dewey on many important issues in psychology including the roles of inheritance and environment in the development of intelligence and the conception of intelligence, itself. Dewey's ability to remain close to people whose ideas he vigorously opposed was but one of the inspiring aspects of Dewey's character. The shortcomings of this book made me more aware than ever that a full scale biography of Dewey, the psychologist, is needed rather than another biography of Dewey the philosopher, especially a tepid, uneven one like this.   Martin, a humanities professor and a practicing psychonanalyst with an eclectic background occasionally deals with psychiatric disorder in Dewey's life (and the lives of his family members) and trots out some watered down neo-Freudian interpretations of his family life. Yet much of the time, Dewey, the man, remains elusive. Martin makes a number of preposterous claims about Dewey: he tells us that Dewey was "impoverished" for most of his professional life, although his salary was far in excess of that of an ordinary wage earner of his time and his home had servants. We also are told that Dewey was unique among 20th century leftists in his rejection of Marxism and Communism. In fact, Dewey was one of many American leftists who were opposed to Marx and Communism. American socialism probably owes more to the social gospel and non-Marxist political economists like Veblen than to Marx, Lenin, or Stalin. Martin also ignores the vigorous and polemical support Dewey gave to World War I and the strains it caused between Dewey and friends like Jane Addams. Instead, we are told that Dewey was a consistent pacifist driven by a concern that war would undermine democratic values. Remarks like these demonstrate Martin's ignorance of Dewey's life, as well as an ignorance of the social and political environment in which Dewey lived. Much of the discussion of Dewey, the philosopher, is laden with academic philosophy that is insufficiently explained for the educated layperson. Many well-educated people are not familiar with Hegel or the Vienna Circle or only dimly recall these from an introductory course. Many are drawn to Dewey because of his educational ideas or his importance in 20th century demoratic socialism, hence, it is probably not reasonable to expect that readers will automatically be drawn to the various debates within academic philosophy.  This book is an easier read than the dense, often turgid works of Robert Westbrook or Steven Rockefeller. On the other hand, the book lacks the breezy, often humorous, tone of Alan Ryan's biography. Ryan's book is a much better introduction to Dewey---witty and scholarly, yet extremely readable. Although Ryan also focuses on Dewey the philosopher, he is more knowledgable about many aspects of Dewey's life and environment than Martin. He recognizes, for example, the importance and the the deeply flawed character of G. Stanley Hall, who provided Dewey with an introduction to operationism and to developmental psychology. Ryan also points out the limitations of Dewey's sometimes wooly writing. One of the problems with reading Dewey is that Dewey, the philosopher, often requires an understanding of Dewey, the psychologist, or Dewey, the political activist, to understand many of the basic concepts that guided Dewey decades into his effort to develop a coherent worldview of pragmatism. The same problem occurs when one looks at him as psychologist, as a pedagogue or, as a political commentator/activist. He was all of these things in all his professional identities, to some extent. Despite the recent run of Dewey biographies and the renewed interest in pragmatism, there's still more to learn about Dewey. Unfortunately, only well-read afficionados will get much from Martin's book and many may be distracted by it's shortcomings 
 Dr. Barnard appears in the documentary Super Size Me touting a couple of the ideas in this very book, namely concerning casomorphins in cheese and the supposed opiate effect of chocolate.  I scarcely have enough time to write how awful this book is or how much he misrepresents legitimate research.  First of all, an introduction: Neal Barnard heads the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.  What is this group?  Mostly, a group of people who are not physicians, but who ARE vegans.  Membership requires nothing but $20- no degree, no research experience, nothing.  A strange policy for an organization calling itself a "Physicians Committee."  This is a political interest group so incompetent that it can't even do its own research.  Do a search on PsychINFO or Medline for anything Barnard has published in scholarly literature, and you will find precious little there.  That's because he's too busy writing books like these for people who don't necessarily have the academic background to know full of it he is.  Take for example the chapter on chocolate in this book.  Barnard asserts that chocolate is addictive, that it has a drug effect on the brain.  He even notes one study where naloxone (a drug that blocks the effect of opiates like heroin), also blocked the desire for chocolate.  Wow that's pretty interesting stuff!  Barnard didn't mention a few things about this study though.  First of all, there was more than one group tested.  There were normal subjects, and then there were obese bulimics, people who were quite mentally ill.  Barnard doesn't mention that naloxone ONLY HAD AN EFFECT ON THE BULIMICS.  Hey, that might be inconvenient for making his point, so you can see why it's okay for him to mislead you.  This indicates that the blocking effect had nothing to do with chocolate, but it DID have to do with mental illness.  Moreover, they didn't even test chocolate!  They used several popular snack foods that CONTAINED chocolate.  That didn't keep Barnard from zooming in on one single ingredient though, and not mentioning that the people in this study consumed several other things as well.  Another problem with the chocolate chapter is that he cites a study to support his point that no component of chocolate quells cravings quite the way chocolate itself can.  He is referring to a study in which people who crave chocolate ingested either chocolate, a pill containing the pharmacological equivalent of chocolate, or both.  It turns out that ingesting the pill won't satisfy a chocolate craving, you actually have to eat the stuff.  Not to be deterred, even though this study is actually working AGAINST his point, Barnard compares chocolate to nicotine, and writes that smokers are usually not satisfied with just the patch, they need to actually smoke (he doesn't cite any study in support of this assertion).  Well, actually nicotine patches DO reduce cravings for cigarettes, as anyone who does a cursory search of the literature could easily find out.  More than that, what exactly is Barnard concluding here?  That the taste of chocolate has a drug effect through our tongues, but ingesting it has no effect?  Can anyone really read such garbage without laughing?  I could go on, but you can get this book from your library and see the rest of it for yourself.  When in doubt, look up the references he uses to support his points.  Pretty often, you'll find that the articles he refers to really don't say what he makes them out to say.  I thought Super Size Me was a really good film that pointed out what a vested interest many companies have in keeping us unhealthy.  Unfortunately, Dr. Barnard has his own vested interests, and they don't include science or truth 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.  The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This "problem" became an asset later.  The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.  It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.  In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.  Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.  If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this 
 I have no review because you sent me the wrong Northwest Passage for the second time, and I returned it for the second time and gave up ordering it, and need a refund.                 thank you   Michael N. Smith 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 This is a good textbook for teaching, and not as good of a source for research for real world application reference material, which is what I try to maintain a library to utilize.  Very basic material coverage, good for students.  
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 You would think by now I would have learned not to judge a book by its cover, but that's exactly what I did in this case. The picture on the front cover is charming. The words "Fresh, engaging, and authentically British" from a Booklist reviewer are splashed on the cover. And that reeled me in.  If you like the cozy mystery genre, and are a fan of Agatha Christie, Anne Perry, Dianne Day, Rita Mae Brown, or Margaret Miles, this may not be the book for you. If you liked the 90's TV show Roseanne, you're in for a treat. She's back, this time as a British house cleaner named Lois. Ann Purser goes out of her way to make Lois unsympathetic, and her husband Derek and daughter Josie downright annoying and unlikeable. It seems as though Purser's trying to break down the stereotype of the British mystery by choosing working-class characters in modern times, which I completely respect, but she's building up another stereotype at the same time: that working-class people are brash, crass, and argumentative.  Aside from unsympathetic and sometimes annoying characters, the conclusion of this mystery is a bit far-fetched, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The sad thing is, I'm not even all that curious about having them answered.  A very unsatifying read. 
 Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.  Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!  The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate, but since it's 600x as sweet as sugar, they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar. But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates.  This could really screw up somebody on Atkins' Induction phase.  For example, the day before I learned this, I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda.  I didn't know that in 2 quarts I was drinking down 24 carbs!  What to do?  Find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose.  They use water as the filler, it's super-concentrated still, and it truly has 0 carbs.  I look forward to the day when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda.  (That's 0.0g, not 0.49g! 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 This book has an overview of diseases for most domestic large animals.  I found this text to be too general to be very helpful as a reference guide for folks needing all the details.  It does have some decent rule out lists.  
 I have been looking for a 10-13" skillet/braiser that will remain flat on my electric flat cooktop.  After reading all the descriptions-page after page, I thought the Anolon Titanium would do the trick;however, after one(1) heat up on high to fry some hamburger, I had a pan that wobble terribly on its middle point(right where Anolon stamps its logo).  One can whirl the pan on this point with ease.  This product may be great for the gas cooktop, but do not get it if you want a flat bottom pan for your electric cooktop.  The handles stayed cool and had a good grip feel and balance for carrying and cooking 
 This book is very much oriented around following a certain structure. Syd focuses on describing the three act structure and how to build your screenplay in this structure. While structure definitely is a valuable element, I would not recommend anybody concentrating on it too much, cause the right structure will come in the right way for your script. Much more important elements like how to create rich characters and to enhance your story are not dealt with very much. If creative advice is given it comes across in a quite rigid way, and is lacking foundation. You really feel that Syd didn't gain his knowledge by working as a professional screenwriter, but just by analyzing them. I am missing that kind of sensitivity, creativity and flexibility in his messages to writers that would come from persons who have really written screenplays themselves. To sum it up: The book was not valuable for me, in fact it left me disappointed and a bit frustrated. Other screenwriting books on the contrary have been a very inspiring and motivating source 
 Gosh, maybe I shouldn't review this book, but then - any book that I bring home that is so difficult to follow that I just couldn't finish it probably deserves one star. While the subject matter was of great interest to me, the writing style was not a comfortable read. I was constantly trying to remember who was who, what time period it had just jumped to and then jumped to again and, worst of all, the flow of the words was simply missing. Hard to pinpoint the problem, but by Page 42 I was so confused and frustrated, not entertained, and wondering why I was working so hard to read it when I had a stack of other promising new works waiting. (Now I'm readin 'A Long Way Down' by Nick Hornby and was mesmerized from the first page. A perfect example of a well-structured story that just glides from page to thought-provoking page. My full review to be posted shortly. 
 This third book of the incredibly bloated Mars Trilogy has the fascination of watching a train wreck. There is actually some suspense: how many pages will I skim before something actually happens?  I have to admire the thoroughness with which KSR created a world and made Mars real. He has described every valley, crater, canyon, caldera and dune--and invented a lot of geographical features that aren't there yet, such as rivers and oceans. He has catalogued the lichens, fir forests and alpine vegetation that will someday live on a terraformed Mars. (These details are actually interesting... to a point. But KSR went waaay beyond that point.)   Most of all, he has described the society that will live on Mars. It will be a sort of free-flowing California in which eternally young Martians will flit from tent city to underground commune to coffeehouse to free-sex bathhouse. (I'm still not sure who is paying the bills, growing the food or creating the oxygen for them to breathe. I think a planet of artificial habitats would be tightly controlled, even tyrannical.) They will discuss politics until your face turns blue. Martians will all be utopians and anarchists of various stripes. But when the subject of immigration (from Earth) comes up, watch them turn out as xenophobic as any America-Firster. (yes, there is a group called Mars First.)  Why did I read this series? There is a fascination to the topic. Imagine terraforming and colonizing another planet! I hoped I would learn something. The most interesting chapters were the ones where humans colonize Mercury, Venus, the moons of Jupiter, and even places like Uranus' moon Triton. Imagine humans growing gills and genetically modifying their eyes for the low light of the "sun-deprived moons". That's science fiction! Although I was disappointed that there is not one mention of any sort of extraterrestrial life. The moons and planets are merely real estate to be exploited--making this trilogy a platform for the hubris of mankind.  I also liked the chapters where Nirgal visits Earth. What would a Martian think of Earth? Good stuff there.  As for the rest of the chapters, the editor should have chopped them out with a big scissors. Why oh why does KSR pack hundreds of pages with self-indulgent ramblings, travelogues and descriptions of sailing, hiking, racing, parasailing...ok, KSR is living out his outdoor sports fantasies. But Please! Novels are supposed to have Stuff Happening! Lord of the Rings was the same size as the Mars trilogy... but at least that book had a plot!  Even worse are the passages about the senescence of the First Hundred (now about 220 years old). I can see that space colonization and longevity could go hand in hand. Likewise, the longevity treatment was a plot device so KSR could keep the same characters through the whole trilogy. But why bother? I'm sick of those characters. Nirgal was the only character I really liked. Maya, Ann, Sax etc. are tiresome, whiny old farts and frankly I was glad when they finally started dying off. In fact I can't buy the whole concept of a longevity serum being widely spread through overpopulated Earth. (Which then wants Mars as an immigration safety valve.) A society that would go for such a thing is so stupid, they almost deserve whatever happens to them.  After I waded through this whole mess, the ending was a fizzle. Nothing happened. You will feel as if you are aging 220 years yourself, as you read this series 
 This is the second disturbing book I have read by Coulter.  Her novels seem to be riddled with abuse; both mental and physical.  If you're looking for a fairytale romance or any romance at all skip this book.  This book was about an Englishman who goes to the Carribean to investigate ghosts/spirits haunting his brother's property.  That storyline flatlines and instead Coulter focuses on this odd, completely disturbed, man-hating young lady that is forced to wed the Englishman for her own protection.  That sounds heroic, but trust me it's not.  There is absolutely nothing in this novel that makes you want to keep reading further.  
 As a follow up of a review in Business week did buy this book which I find good to look at but almost impossible to read as such  Sorr 
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 We all knew that Costes' spirit faded away about the 4th volume. Anyway we didn't miss unity in other opus. Tracklistings were varied and elegant. #7 lost rang, and #8 make you feel sick.   Tracks by Tosca (good Heidi Bruehl despite it's been compiled in lots of places), Mark Farina and Parov Stelar remain to mythical moments of "La Suite (#2)" and "Etage Trois (#3)".  Mixing is bad and when it's good a pc mixed what the "Dj" could not mix (we are inured to Pompougnac's works) and you can perfectly guess where the cut of a track is.  Brazilian dreadful tunes (Zuco 103), hip hop for old snobs who can't throw their Jazzanova cafï¿½-music CDs (Smooth) and music for nappy TV ads (Flying Pop's).  What about Hï¿½tel Costes 60 
 Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid 
 I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. The revised edition simply has the typos corrected. At no time do you get the sense that an editor ever read this book. The language is mostly incomprehensible.   The online site that is supposed to give examples and style sheets redirects to a dog breeding site owned by the author.  After I wrote an email questioning that, it was changed. I have yet to hear back from the publishers, SAMS, and I would avoid all of their books because of this waste of paper.   I started to make a list of omissions and vague descriptions after the 2nd chapter, but that list is too long to outline here.  This is a very anti-design, techie look at CSS presenting an attitude that was out of date before the text was written.  The project I was working on through this book failed, but I now know that I know less about CSS than when I started this book. I am going to have to unlearn what little 'Teach yourself CSS in 24 hours' has taught me 
 I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
 "That's the American disease as I see it: rampant, illogical stereotyping. We would not be America without it," writes Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez on page 6 of her novel "The Dirty Girls Social Club." She is right, of course, so perhaps is not surprising --although it is very disappointing-- that American-born Valdes-Rodriguez then goes on to write a book that contains the most annoying, stupid and inaccurate of stereotypes.  According to her, almost every Colombian man "has had sex with another man at least once" (huh?) and that doesn't mean they are gay (double huh?). She says all Puerto Rican women are fat (Really? How strange then that I'm size 2-4), all Cubans lie, and "all immigrants" (now there's a generalization that will almost always make you look like a fool) buy tacky furniture and then "cover it with clear plastic." I would invite Valdes-Rodriguez to visit my beautiful apartment, full of sleek, modern, uncovered-with-plastic furniture, but her book annoyed me too much.  And don't get me started on the basic mistakes of this book: she gets the population of New York wrong (I guess doing a simple search on Google is out of the question when you're writing trash) and, most stupidly of all, she says steering wheels in cars in Rome are on the right. Obviously Valdes-Rodriguez has never been to Italy, but didn't anyone edit this book? How ignorant can a person be?   If you are in desperate search of something to read, get the phone book. It will be less insulting and more accurate than "The Dirty Girls Social Club"--and about as entertaining.  
 After using TurboTax couple of years and then using TaxCut for last two years (2005 and 2006 returns) I concluded that TurboTax is much superior software. TaxCut's only advantage is that it is cheaper. If you take out price from the equation, TaxCut is inferior in quality.  - In 2005 TaxCut software there was not PDF output of all the forms. This was pretty silly because after couple of years if I want to access my tax return I am not going to install TaxCut again in my computer and view by return. I would rather have have my tax return available in some widely acceptable format like PDF and then access/distribute whenever I want (I don't keep my documents in hardcopies). So I wrote to H&R Block. This year they added that saving return in PDF file feature available. But unfortunately, this is far from being perfect. It excludes number of important forms - example, IRS form 8853, California Adjustment Schedule 540CA etc. Instead of that it saves numbers of useless worksheet (without any data entered in those worksheets), same form multiple times.  - Most annoying thing about this software is updating incorrect data. In one form I entered wrong data. While reviewing it I found a problem and went to that specific section to update. But in calculation TaxCut still showed old incorrect number. I just could not make it to use new corrected number. Eventually I had to restart a new return from scratch - just to have an dollar amount corrected.  - In many section useful Helps are missing 
 I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen 
 This book is rife with spelling errors. As far as subject matter, simply do a search on Google for "I hate liberals" and copy/paste the results and bind it. Then you'll have this book. Nothing intelligent is in it. There are plenty of books about Bush that are far better than this book. I recommend "A Matter of Character" and "Misunderstood", and possibly "A Man of Faith. 
 If your school or professor says otherwise, take a different prof. or transfer to another school.  In fact, this text is purposely cryptic: Total BDSM engineering-style. If your course doesn't use the Schaum's outline, then you are probably being duped intentionally or by a naive prof 
 This entire novel was devoted to characters walking around wondering why the sky is dark all the time. If your looking for something to happen look elsewhere. It's strange that the author writes in the back of the book that she has to extend the series by another novel, since 80% of this easily could have been cut. Almost as big a let down as George RR Martins exact same excuse in his new novel, a book we all waited around 5 years for only to discover 700 pages worth of everyone's least favorite characters doing nothing. There is one major downfall in both these new works and that it extremely lacks in events taking place and instead heavily leans on boring diatribe from characters we are already tired of 
 This Detox program would be difficult to follow for someone with a job and demands on their time. It is not a simple plan 
 So irritating to hear these guys paint radio rock with a thin layer of metal, using the deteriorating skeleton of the "Soilwork sound" as a brush. So pitiable to hear Bjorn awkwardly [attempt to] hit notes outside his vocal range. So ironic the album cover is proportional to the music in terms of boringness.  Oh, but then there's "Blind Eye Halo," the obligatory pseudo-thrash snoozer. The inclusion of this song means Soilwork are as great as ever, evidently. Too bad the drug industry could sell bits of this song to cure insomnia.  Basically, this album is fail. Try Chainheart Machine and A Predator's Portrait, those albums were Soilwork's peak 
 Save your money.  I could barely stay awake while reading  any of the stories 
 Backed by Japan, Taiwan wants its independence. Neither Taiwan nor Japan wants China to become a democratic country to grow stronger and to be close to the Americans and the West. This author's project are mostly funded by the Taiwan government controled sources, or from the source that funded by the Taiwan government. He just pretends to concern making China a free world, but his job is actually to hold China there under the Communist regime to satisify his financier. - Of Columbia U 
 Another raw feeding book is on the market and this one doesn't add anything new.  What bothered me the most was for all the hoopla, Lonsdale does NOT even talk about the QUALITY of the food you're feeding.  What good is feeding raw if you're not feeding QUALITY and natural proteins?  
 As the title says its not much more than that, so its going back as I write this review. I have a YB 400 and its a much better radio than this piece of plastic.. 
 I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on "Satanic Majesties", and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the "Rock n Roll Circus". A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read 
 Does not keep beverage warm for a long enough time. Construction is cheap and does not deserve the price. 
 Skateboarding could really do without self conscious myth making like this. One part that really got me mad was the film maker saying "These guys were making history every single day!" or something to that effect. Who are the egotistical ones, the filmakers there to get rich and famous or the skaters who made their own decks and skated curbs in the rain for the enjoyment of it? I eventually flicked channels half way through the movie after a piece of dubious editing.  Stuff like this gets in the way of skateboarding 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 The  Secret garden  This book was pure disappointment.  This book was definitely not exiting and I can tell you why. First, people who like fun action packed books don't by this book. This book didn't match my type of liking, It was very dull because it had no exiting parts. The only exiting part was when  They found the secret garden. The author  of The Secret Garden explained the characters very well. She caught the 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.   I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 I'm a big fan of mind puzzles, and especially of the "whodunnit" type, often titled with a variation of "minute mysteries". They're particularly good if I have to read them at least twice to ascertain the subtle clues to solve the case and then proclaim to myself, "clever!". Thus, when I saw the title of this book, I figured I was in for a good challenge. Not so. In fact, this book was very disappointing. Although Weber did a good job of constructing the backstories, the "mysteries" themselves required little if any thought and basically   the solution was apparent through common sense. 
 Wow.  It's rare I consider a movie absolutely horrendous, but this one qualifies.  We are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy, and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie, I found myself yelling "DIE already".  When he doesn't kill himself in the end, all I wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him.  A dumb stupid awful "indie" movie that is a waste of film, time and effort 
 This book is awful and out of date. I read a friend's copy and hated it. She attributes agression to schizophrenia, says that psychology has absolutely no place in training animals, and thinks that a fearful dog can be cured by walking it around for an hour and giving it steady pops on the choke chain. She also feels that no dog should be allowed to lick people on the face and that cryptorchidism (where one of the testicles does not descend) causes behavioral problems. Right....  I think perhaps this book was considered alright in the 70's. Now, we *know* that you cannot fix all of a dog's problems simply by popping it with a choke chain. I beleive that training collars to have a place in working with some dogs, but there is no wonder cure for everything and many dogs simply do not need them. They can cause tracheal damage when used improperly (and many, many people use them wrongly, even when being instructed) and what's more they can damage a dog emotionally - making it more fearful than when it started.   She also claims that a timid dog can be made into a happy, confident dog simply by improving its tail carriage (making it run with steady pops on the choke chain). While adopting a confident or happy body position can *help* with a creature's emotional state (like when you feel happier because you're smiling), it certainly will not *cure* a behavioral problem. Her statement is akin to saying that a depressed person can completely solve their clinical depression simply by smiling for 20 minutes every day.  I agree with her on using confinement (crate training) with puppies, but there are far better and more up to date resources 
 Readers with previous experience with Ornstein's books may find The Right Mind the most interesting he's written. The view of brain through psychology offers a different approach about brain functions. For Beginners, this book may be quite useful. Though I read other book from  Ornestein, I was expecting to find deep research on brain assymetry, which  this book is poor, there's nothing you can't find over Internet on related  sites. For intermeddiate readers on brain issue, this book may offer some  interesting approaches, but too hard to get them between 200 pages.  Instead, I would reccomend Carl Sagan's "Dragons of Eden", a  marvelous and interesting book about brain development. Advanced readers  won't like Ornstein for explaing brain lateralization, and a more  appropriate book would be "Left brain, Right Brain", the only  serious book written on this subject. Conclusion: Ornstein book is not that  bad at all. If you like Oliver Sacks and psychological views of brain, this  is indeed a good choice. Wrong Title though, coz it doesn't have much about  brain lateralization itself (by the way, the book enphasizes the importance  of both hemispheres working together - which is quite obvious when you want  a scientific approach - but many people forget on daily life) 
 This is one of those books that appeal to the pretentious.  The author is self-conscious and clever and has obviously written it with literary critics and English teachers and the sort of pseudo-intellectual that hangs out in New York cafes in mind.  The actual story was the last thing on his mind and it shows--the whole thing is a pastiche with what plot there is used to parade his annoying characters (Camus or Satre heroes in Victorian dress) and to make annoying observations (all the last word in philosophy circa 1960 but really dull in 2006).  Nothing could be more contrived than the alternate endings that one must pick from.  The reader does not want to pick an ending, to be truthful, because the author has not made the reader CARE.  I think I will continue reading actual Victorian novels, by the likes of Dickens, Trollope and Eliot rather than ever bothering to re-read this nonsense 
 I read this book after it was recommended to me and I came with high expectations, maybe too high. While I respect the writer as a sucessful author I was quite disappointed with this book. It was not the type of writing and storyline I expected.  The book forced me to ask myself if I was starved for more drama or could a simple, fairy-tale story satisfy my thirst? I did want to see more. When I noticed that I was getting very close to the end and nothing happened yet, not even a sex scene, I was wanting something to explode, some gun to go off, something to put me on the edge of my seat and cause me to escape, SOMETHING! I found myself skipping over pages while reading because I was uninterested in conversations, hoping to get to something, something that would drive me and make me say, "I didn't see that coming!" But that didn't happen. Everything was predicable to the very end. And the end was just that, the end, as one reviewer wrote, "The ride off into the sunset" toward D.C and while I wanted very much to feel good and say "Ah, wasn't that sweet?" it wasn't the heart candy that I believe the author was trying to give us. It fell very very short of that. The past life time storyline was just too ill-developed and not at all believeable even if I am one that believes in such possibilities.  I would have loved to have seen that developed more! With that said, I am very sure I will read another book by this author because I know she is an excellent writer. I will give her another try. She's proven herself, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 The whining drunk shows his true colors.  Should have been off the air at least 10 years before they finally showed him the door.  What a low-life ... if you're broke, it's your fault.  And, if you lost the Masters vs. Arnie, it's because you didn't play well enough to win 
 Rob Zombie has lost a few steps when it comes to good music. There are only two or three tracks on here worth listening to. At least he's making good movies. I guess he spread himself too thin 
 I can't get what peeps find so good with this so terrible CD of the Ex Westlifer Brian McFadden. It may appear many lack the musical/emotional sensitivity nowdays, thinking everything is great, how sad. After somebody gave it to me, and one so unbearable listen, I just threw it away, found Brians voice, lyrics, music and all some of the worst heard to date, and to top it off the horrid Duett with Delta Goodrem whom I'm fan of, just total disgusted and saddened me beyond words - This is typical Brian as he did to the poor Atomic Kitten member, not too long ago. All the Rumours regarding Delta & Brian should be treated as empty air, as how insensitive the media is nowdays - No match in Heaven!. And hope that this so totally untalented Ex Westlifer will never put out another Album again, and never sing with the OZ Sweetheart ever again,as she doesnt deserve to be made so dirty by this horrible Brian McFadden with his so dark past, and this so bad CD also shows, noticing his poor songwriting on the sideline just too clearly. A very bad CD of a very bad singer, that should not have been...Very sad! 
 The book is just a series of short notes with very simplistic ideas such as buying notebooks/3 ring binders/ folders.  All of the info is readily available on-line and for free 
 ....boring and Woody Allen will drive you insane. He never stops talking!!! 
 As others have said, this book started off so strongly that I thought I was in for another "DaVinci Code".  Instead, it got itself caught up in a lot of the same old tired cliches you expect from a bad action movie.  There's the obsessed scholar, the haunted male hero who doesn't open up to anyone, the villain seeking revenge and a conspiracy to protect old secrets.  It didn't bother me until about halfway through, when the book just went on some unbelievable paths.  The ending especially was disappointing, as it was your typical BS Hollywood ending with people coming back from the dead, sudden changes of heart and everyone living happily ever after.  Note to the author:  it's a very bad sign when I start rooting for the "heroes" to fail to escape from a perilous situation.  It only avoids one star because the scenes that take place in the middle ages were well done, and there is a nice little twist right at the end that I enjoyed.  Otherwise, a largely forgettable book 
 Terence Howard stars as a pimp that's looking to "better" his life by making in big in rap music.  A mediocre film that further pushes the stereotype of black people and it's a poor attempt to draw pity toward people that spend their lives making excuses for the dirty deeds they do. NOBODY is forced to be a pimp. Sorry. Go get a job even if it's at the store. Atleast you would have some dignity then.  Pimps have NO DIGNITY. What's shocking is there's women that condone this movie and what it contains. But hey, we live in a sick world now so who can be surprised.  2/ 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 Not since St. Augustine has there been such a whining, carping screed begging for Christian inculcation by a celebrated intellect. I'm not even sure why this is a book. A cranky letter to the dean, and president of the alumni association would have served his purpose, and saved a few trees as well.   Without going into detail, or needing to, you will find in a nutshell that Mr. Buckley feels it's fine for Yale faculty of faith to gently shepherd students toward Christian beliefs within their science and math classes, but it's a sin for the other, heathen, atheistic masters, to rampage through the clay of young minds and, in one semester, destroy the fragile faith of 18 to 20 years of Christian indoctrination. Pu-leese!  I'll grant you he was only 25, and at that time standing up for one's individual ideals was new, but why is it still in print!  On the other hand, in today's renewed climate of monkey-brained hysteria in the classroom perhaps it might seem to be time to dig up an old reactionary guru or two for validation. In fact, soon I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some addlebrained congressman was trying to pass a law mandating the teaching of Buckleism in schools.  Cool book title though!  
 I give the original 5 stars, but why is disney taking all its classics and adding new songs to it? i was so dissapointed when i rented this and there were new scenes in it. i dont want "new and improved" i want the original, the one i watched when i was younger 
 Before you buy this book for your loved-one, you should be aware that it is full of Satanic images.  The children gather together in the haunted house with the ghost of the boy who commited suicide there.  They cast a mystical circle complete with candles, tarot cards, assigning each child a suit and an element.  They work together to conjure spirits and "energy" from the house.  Oh, okay, they use the energy to help the girl and her battered mother; but....she doesn't get out of the abusive situation at the end of the book.  She is left to rely on the "energy" they were able to channel to mom and her ghost boyfriend.   My daughter and I had a long talk after this book.  I have never censored her avid reading before, but I'm really glad I took a look at this book and was able to open a discussion regarding the dangers of playing around in The Beautiful Side of Evil. ( Now, that's a book to check out. 
 Anybody can shock.  I can slit my wrists in the middle of the interstate, or piss on a cross.  Shocking, but hardly artistic.  I really wish she would stop making movies.  She has the film-making skills of a clumsy chimpanzee and writes dialogue that is so other-worldly and removed from our own reality that it's like listening to a non-sensical foreign language.  Please, please stop making movies.  If you have a message, simply write it down on a piece of cardboard and, yes, stand in the middle of the interstate 
 This piece of garbage is not worth your time.Go elsewhere for true amusement. Rediscover Kurt Vonnegut. This entire book is just terrible and was the only thing I had on my cross country flight 
 I seem to be in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. The main character is, of course, the "only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf" but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness. I felt the plot got swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in her world, and the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a plane and had nothing else to do. The plot fishtails several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. In short, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general, and will likely skip her books in the future 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I had to read this book for an anthropology class taught by an intelligent but uberfeminist professor.  There's an important point in this book that sheds light on its angle: when a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and full coverings was asked how she can walk around in the heat dressed in such a manner she responds something to the effect of "it's not as hot as the fires of hell."  Mernissi is not about to challenge behaviors that are dictated by Islamic scriptures.  Her argument is that the veil and woman's place in the Muslim society are a result of misinterpretation of the scriptures and the hadith.  This is sort of akin to Christians trying to reinterpret creation as an instructive myth after Darwin shattered the fundamentalist vision of creation.  I think Mernissi's approach is generally doomed because, if tradition has failed to maintain the original spirit of a religion, a new analysis almost 1500 years after the fact is almost certainly doomed.  There are too many epistemological problems with diving the original intentions behind a text that is so old.  Mernissi may convince some readers that her radically new interpretation is correct but only at the cost of introducing uncertainty and mistrust in the traditions themselves. Fatally wounding relgious traditions is nearly a fatal wound to the religion itself, and will only cause apathy or fundamentalist overreaction to a challenge of the status quo 
 Somehow, author Ted Yeatman has made Jesse and Frank James boring.  One has to admire the depth and breadth of his research into the lives of the notorious Missouri outlaws, but what was desperately needed here was a co-author who knew how to tell a good story.  One bank or train robbery sounds pretty much like all the others in Yeatman's plodding account, and I could not keep the brothers' numerous gang members straight -- the author does nothing to make them come alive as individuals.  The appendices and bibliographical notes are rather awe-inspiring -- Yeatman has done his homework, and then some -- but getting through this book is a hard slog 
 I purchased this program recently, and was very disappointed.  The maps are very limited...for example, most of the major tourist areas (beaches, Newport, ect.) in Rhode Island are cut out of the RI map.  I recommend buying MS Streets and Trips 2005 (which includes Pocket Streets 2005 in the box) instead: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002DOEAM/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654?v=glance&s=pc&n=507846  With this program, you have the entire USA at your disposal, and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone.  Fortunatly, the store that sold me Pocket Streets allowed me to exchange it for Streets and Trips (after paying the difference).  The prices are very close.    
 A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book.  I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside.  The book just made me disoriented and tired. 
 I am a cartoon, and a comic fan.  I have been for years.  I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do.  The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch.  But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far.  There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers.  Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room.  I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film.  For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often.  For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again 
 doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths." 2 Timothy 4:3-4  This verse was written by Paul almost 2000 years ago to warn the Christians to guard their hearts from false teachings that will arise from among the Church. - "and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking preserve things, to draw away their disciples after them." - Acts 20:30-31    As a servant of the Lord, I feel strongly compelled by His Spirit to warn my fellow Christians of the false doctrine being taught by Tim LaHaye.  This man and his partner are being used by Satan himself to decieve millions of Christians across the nation concerning the truth and the end times of this earth, and this is making me sick.  Tell me why Tim LaHaye, who has never studied theological doctrine or mastered the Bible's teachings, has sold millions upon millions of books regarding prophecy.    The verse that I started with clearly tells us why.  If Tim LaHaye really loves God, than he would respect His Holy Word including God's sacred prophecies.  But instead of writing a book strictly on the Holy prophecies of God to bring Him the glory, Tim chooses to envelop God's sacred prophecies with his fictitious novels known as the Left Behind Series.  Now what were his motives for doing this?  To interpret the scriptures correctly, or to sell millions of novels and receive the wealth and fame for himself? For those of you who read his novels, did you desire to truly know what the Bible says concerning prophecies or did you enjoy having your ears "tickled" by his fanciful writing. "but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires."    In the past year, a man completed devoted to God, has taken up the monumental task of writing a new book to help clear the confusion behind the modern view of Biblical prophecies.  The book is called End Time Delusions by Steve Wohlberg, and unfortunaley, it is directed at refuting many of the false teachings endorsed by the Left Behind novels.  Mr. Wohlberg has been earnestly studying Biblical prophecies for the past 25 years.  Everything he comments on is strongly supported by the scriptures and he encourages every reader to evaluate the Bible before establishing an opinion.  The book is concise (220 pages), but it is jam-packed with years and years of extensive research.  May the Lord be with you as you continue to search the scriptures for the truth.  "For the truth will set you free! 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 "In My Country" is certainly a well meaning film.  Filled with dignity, it means to explore the atrocities committed in the age of Apartheid.  Can justice be served?  Can South Africa move on?  How complicit is the average man?  There are certainly important topics and issues to be dealt with--but rarely have I seen them served up so falsely and dispassionately.    Everything in "In My Country" is a construct.  You've got Juliette Binoche as the face of white shame, Samuel L. Jackson as black rage (though he's an American), Brendan Gleeson as the villain, Binoche's assistant as the tolerant and understanding African, and her boss as the face of white indifference.  Of course, this story is told from the vantage point of the white lady and the American--as these stories rarely examine issues from the African viewpoint.  Even the testimony of atrocities--which should be a dramatic highpoint--are so staged, so false with the requisite swoons from the audience at "shocking" revelations.  And Binoche is ever present to provide the tears--but as the emotion isn't genuinely developed, I continued to sit there feeling rather empty at the whole exercise.  The Africans are never portrayed as significant indivduals, but as understanding and forgiving souls.  I'd have appreciated a bit of emotional complexity at any point!  If the pairing of Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson seems an odd match, trust me--it is.  As characters with opposing views, they are put together rather conveniently.  No actual friendship is ever developed, we're just supposed to take it at face value that these two would hang out together.  Well, I didn't believe it for a second.  It was necessary for the plot, so it happened--why bother with actual character development?  There's a more important message to be delivered by having them debate.  Of course, to make matters worse--a romantic entanglement evolves.  There's not much drama there, either, as Binoche seemingly has an indifference to her husband and children.  If she's conflicted about anything, it certainly never shows.  And as if matters aren't bad enough, there's a heavy-handed (and obvious) ending that is supposed to be a revelatory twist.  But I can only say it once more, without bothering to make the characters real--who cares?    A message can only take you so far.  I'd have rather have watched a relevant speech, because no one here was concerned with drama.  
 Like the Donny & Marie and Donny companion compilations, this cd sounds just dreadful.  Like so many other recent reissues, the person doing the remastering tried to make these recordings sound as "modern" as possible, meaning that they have eliminated what little dynamic range was present to begin with on these recordings and also set the EQ so that the tonal balance is on the extremely bright side.  Donny's voice, for example, is thin and harsh sounding.  This is the worst sounding Osmonds collection I've heard, and I have everything Curb has issued on cd.  Avoid this one at all costs 
 I have read many children's books in my time and I have to say that not even a child would be able to follow along with this.  What's with all the dashes, arrows, and other symbols?  This only added to the confusion of what the author was trying to say.  My nephew, who reads three grade levels ahead of his grade tossed the book away in frustration.  I am surprised that dogs all over do not protest this piece of literary garbage.  This was definitely a book that one could put down.  What a nightmare 
 This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.  So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 This product came very quickly however I've already thrown it out.  I was very disappointed.  It doesn't clip onto the side very well, and once the grass starts growing, my cats want to eat it and it yanked out very easily.  Another bad side effect is that it makes the water green and the sides all slimy.  Great idea but fell flat.  I'm so disappointed because one of my cats just loves eating grass and buying it at the pet store is so expensive 
 I thought this book would be more representative of the sensationalist reporting the media has been shoving down the throats of Americans for the last few years.  Instead, this book essentially says there is not enough of this over-sensationalized baloney, and it begs that the media produce more in the name of our founding fathers.  If you dare to go there, check this out from the library.  This drivel is not worth your hard earned money 
 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.    Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware 
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.   It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.  Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.  Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book 
 This DVD was probably the stupidest thing I have ever watched.  There is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production.  The water crystals are pretty ;-) but everything else about this production is complete nonsense 
 I don't recommend this book for readers with any significant exposure to French culture and history.I was intrigued by the title of the book and a report by a friend of mine who flipped through this book at the bookshop. I picked it up based on her suggestion and some online reviews. I didn't make it through the fourth chapter. The book trades in low-level comedy surrounding basic differences and stereotypes etc: fashion and style, work hours, kissing, etc. I suppose I was looking for more sophisticated comedy surrounding real differences like fatalism and grand projects etc. I just couldn't get into it - too much cringing 
 This is another example of a horrible waste of time and money. Our Emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair. And that brings around another problem -- Emjoi customer service and repair service. You'll want to avoid both. Better yet, avoid Emjoi and avoid the total headache.  Not only are Emjoi products cheap, they are painful to use 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 this movie is very boring, in the 2hr and 10 min the actors only have about 5 lines that they speek. this is a very slow movie 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 I just finished Bookman's Wake.  I wanted to like it a lot, but that didn't prove possible.  The story roams all over the place, characters appear, vanish without comment and reappear.  And characters there are galore!  There must be about 500 main characters...well, perhaps I overstate that.  There are many, many characters whose names appear once and then are brought up again 50 pages later.  We are expected to remember who they are and how they fit in.  Some of them are very important to the story, but I couldn't remember who they were.  My husband had the same problem.  We kept asking each other "Who's ---?" "Is she the woman who....?"  "I don't know, maybe she's ---."  This book has some thrilling parts and interesting parts, but the whole is just a mishmash.  There are also stanzas of a clunky poem fashioned after Poe's The Raven.  It attempts to set out clues and character descriptions while remaining a credible poem and succeeds at neither.    I loved the beginning 100 pages or so and then it fell apart.  I kept reading to the end, hoping to have some sense made of the thing, but one of the most interesting characters just fades away 3/4 of the way through and that's that.    This guy wrote one of my favorite mysteries, Deadline, so I was greatly disappointed with this scrambled, overwritten novel 
 This book is terrible! You read through the whole thing, and you don't even learn anything!  I would strongly recommend people not to buy this book.   Otherwise, you just wasted 30 dollars on worthless bs. 
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 Let me start by saying I love a good historical fiction book.  I picked up a copy of this one, after reading the reviews by others.  Obviously I don't have the same taste in books.  So not to knock anyone's thoughts of this book, but...Quite possibly this is one of the worst books in the already tastelessly saturated genre!  And I don't even pretend to have high standards!!!  Never have I seen a book so filled with cardboard characters (I won't even mention the awful stereotyping), completely predictable storyline, (which is one of the most preposterous I've ever read, by the way), and so overwrought with tacky metaphors.  I nearly died at the use of the supposed "local dialect".  I have never wanted to stop reading a book because it was so bad, but as they say, "never say never".  I read this to the end, just to see if it would get any better.  I thought it was turning a corner then wham!, the passage about the vegetables.  Why, oh why?!?  **To be perfectly honest, I was more curious to see whether this book could possibly get any WORSE, highly entertaining that it did!**  If you're not looking for a serious read, and would like a few juicy love scenes, then this book fits the bill.  (As I try to find a positive in everything).  Images of cheap dime store romance novels are forever emblazoned in my memory when I think of this book!  I find it impossible to take this book seriously.  I'd give it 0 stars, if possible.  My apologies to those who enjoyed this one!  If you want a sweet love story, set in a historical period, try Patience and Sarah by Isabel Miller.    
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 Let me explain the situation.  We have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball.  Sound familiar?  Probably not.  I would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept.  Recomendation?  I have none.  I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film 
 I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash 
 Alright, I'll confess to a slight infatuation with Jet Li, but even that did not make this movie more than passable. The plot is all over the place. It barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive, locations would develop and then nothing would come of them. The bad guys were just silly - I like real malice and evil in my badies, I like to hate them and enjoy their come uppance. Well the silly twisted bad boy was just pathetic, and Jet Li, ever serene, was so far above the whole mess, so detached and lovely, just going through a very routine job of being Jet Li. The evil imperialist Yankees plotting to capture unsuspecting Chinese immigrants and enslave them were cartoon cuts outs. Like every other enthusiast of this genre I enjoy the carefully choreographed fights and they were good, but not good enough to redeem this film. Give me Kung Fu Hustle any time - now there is quality 
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 I recommend that you peruse the pages of this book at your local library or book store prior to purchasing. The author has compiled 308 pages of supposed facts, ideas, opinions, and "objective illumination." No doubt some of the data provided is true and the first 83 pages engross the reader to the beginning of the history of coffee. Unfortunately the narrative then seems to fall apart not because the information may be false or questionable, but rather the author goes off on tangents which seem to simply fill up the pages. Is Rimbaud's influence on Bob Dylan and Patti Smith necessary in the discussion of coffee?   There comes a point when the reader realizes that the author's writing is more of free flow of thoughts and assumed facts. Add to this the lack of citations and notes (which the author fully acknowledges) and the book becomes a jumble of many figures, dates, places and people that lacks organization. 
 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 Well, I never thought I would see the day, but even Caroline is cashing in on the Kennedys. There was a lot of hype about this book. I think it would have been much, much more interesting if Caroline had written it herself, weaving her own memories and thoughts of these PIC Award winners, as well as their biographical profiles. Just having big name writers doesn't do it. That said, these are truly people who showed genuine courage in politics. The Congresswoman's story was most interesting and I would have liked to know even more. A new view of Ford is also shown. But again, just using her famous name instead of using these not very good but well-hyped writers...somehow I can't imagine her mother, or her brother ever doing that 
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 Please take this to HEART....  I love Mr. Belushi's acting, he's funny and all...I have nothing against his career and respect him for making all the changes he did in his life...  BUT...I cannot say this louder then this: NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was reading this, I knew what I was to expect...so I went in with SOME knowledge.   I love a real man, I LOVE A REAL MAN!!  I am NOT your a-typical woman and I will kill or die trying to remain myself.  When ever I see book after book or hear more and more about this ..... I just fume because I will be the FIRST to admit WOMEN'S LIB DESTROYED WOMANHOOD!   BUT and I repeat BUT...NOT ALL WOMEN ARE FOR WOMEN'S LIB AND ALL THE DAMAGE CAUSED IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL WOMEN.   I am destroyed by people like Mr. Belushi because THEY think I am one of the group called 'all women' and am judged because I belong to this group.  His book is the most selfish book I have ever read and again, do not get me wrong about being a man, I SUPPORT IT AND CAN'T STAND a man who can't be a man.... for ME, money is NOT status, a career is NOT status and marriage does not complete me!  If you fail at making the money you want, I'll encourage you to lift your spirits and NEVER tell you what job to do...if you don't have the money to take me out or buy me anything, I don't judge the quality of who you are, I will enjoy a night in front of the dvd player with you and I'M HAPPY!  I don't ask you to call because I'm checking up on YOU, I ask you to call and let me know you're safe....I don't snoop in your stuff because I'm NOSEY, I respect your privacy because I TRUST you - give me reason to stand up and NOT take your crap and I will, but ONLY after I shower you with unconditional love and acceptance because I GIVE IT TO YOU, and if that still hasn't reached you, all I can do is then stand up for myself where my man should be protecting me.   Yes, chivalry IS the key to this girls heart, but you better have a set to back that up too!   Your friends are my friends and I love them because I love you and you love them...nothing more, but they sure do take by destroying us since they don't have the 'us' in their own lives... I SUPPORT and WISH THERE WERE more real men out there...there are only two wants from this woman to her man 1-don't cheat on me and lie to my face, I NEED THAT SECURITY (pay attention, my security does NOT come from YOUR paycheck, it comes from your arm wrapped around me, PROTECTING me with your love) and 2- it is YOUR job to take care of us and when you can't, I am right there to get your back NOT to get in your way, NOT to diminish you, but to HELP YOU when you say you need my help.   That did not cost you your friends, did not cost a penny and it did not cost you your freedoms as a man.  I GIVE FREELY, LOVINGLY, UNCONDITIONALLY and ALWAYS not because of the notches on your bedpost, not because it cost you a dime, not because you did it MY way, not because you gave up one dang thing - I gave you every reason to WANT to give me your arm around me and your WANT to protect me.   Two things is all I need to give you an entire lifetime of love, honor, RESPECT and every ounce of my body to you...FREELY...got it???   I am halfway through the book and realized that yeah, I love one of the biggest jerks out there because of who he's become, I will love him til the day I die and will always and I mean ALWAYS give him that love, RESPECT as a man and honor him as MY man....because 'I' want to change ME to be a better woman, not because he got whipped into what I wanted him to be! NOT ALL WOMEN FIT THE BILL OF TRUE WAMONHOOD but I sure am dang proud of myself that I strive for it 
 Although I read this book a year or two ago, I recently received it for Christmas and decided to look at the reviews, because frankly, I thought it was a terrible book. First, the main character's family is so superstitious that it seems unrealistic. After she "causes her sister's infertility," she paddles down a river, and frankly, the rest was so boring, I forgot what happens next. 
 I have to agree with some other reviewers. I've seen the original series and I still have all of the episodes of the Showtime version recorded. When I saw this on the shelf as "The Complete Series", I naturally assumed that the discussion of a direct-to-DVD conclusion had finally gotten some results. Instead, it turns out that this should be called "The Incomplete Series". Of course, you have no way of knowing this if you buy it in a store.  There's no indication on the outer packaging of what episodes are included. No indication that it ends prematurely and no mention that the series was cancelled before the conclusion of the storyline.   This show was a single continuous storyline with numerous highly connected sub-plots. Pretty much all of them are left hanging. Unless you want to join a large community of frustrated fans who are unlikely to ever receive any sort of closure, I'd avoid buying the set. (no, there's absolutely no hint of what the conclusion was going to be in any of the commentary or extras, either :/ ) However, if you catch wind of a real conclusion (made-for-TV, direct-to-disc movie or even a simple paper copy of Manny Coto's story notes), rush out and buy this set and enjoy it first.  Yes, it's an outstanding dramatic Sci-fi series with top-notch writing, acting, direction and production. However, the more that you enjoy it, the more upset you'll be at being left hanging. 
 When this book was published I was early in my career as a Pentecostal preacher.  Baldwin's desctiption of the religious fervor, the "tarrying" meetings was sensitive and clear. It took such a person to reveal so much about himself and the selt-deprecation (or self-flagellation).  This was a significant part of the lives of those--both black and white--who were taught to despise self to gain the greater approval and glory of God.   This book, especially, was a major turning point in the attitude of those who did not know or care about the "holiness people," the pentecostal, the poor black, or even the acceptance of one whose gender choice was of the same sex.  I would recommend that everyone find a copy before they become out-of-date printings. We live in a much more accepting and tolerant society today but we can continue to improve.     
 This DVD is a poor quality bootleg. The real U.S. title of this film is "Master Killer", but the original title is "36th Chamber of Shaolin". A company called Celestial owns the worldwide copyright on ALL Shaw Brothers movies. Their digitally remastered DVD has been available for a couple of years, and puts this bootleg to shame. That catch is that you must purchase it from a Hong Kong based web site. Amazon is not allowed to sell it, so they have listed this bootleg. Find a Hong Kong based web site and purchase the official DVD 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 On the surface, John Waters has it all -- a loving wife, a beautiful child, a successful business -- but appearances are deceiving. His marriage is in trouble, his business is under investigation by a federal agency, and his business partner has made questionable financial decisions which jeopardize everyone's future. Into this mix wanders Eve Sumner, a stunningly attractive woman who makes it abundantly obvious she's chosen Waters as her next conquest. However, appearances are again deceiving, because Eve Sumner claims she is actually Mallory Chandler, Waters' first great love.  Funny thing, though: Mallory Chandler died ten years previously.  So who is this woman? And how does she know things only Mallory should know?  In an effort to discover the truth, Waters finds himself involved in an affair that quickly turns dangerous, as Eve/Mallory displays the same obsessive behavior that destroyed Waters' love for Mallory twenty years before.  This novel requires a major suspension of disbelief for its critical plot device: transmigration of a soul. Once the reader accepts that, however, the story moves along quickly and works well within its preposterous premise. Waters flails and fumbles and does his best to fix the mess he's made by getting involved with Eve/Mallory, even as she seems to be setting him up for a murder charge. His desperation and fear are palpable, and certainly mitigate his at times wrong-headed choices. I truly enjoyed this story, that is, until I read the final pages.  The final plot twist, which I won't reveal here, is so farfetched, even within the confines of a plot that stretches suspension of disbelief to its outermost limit, as to spoil all the good trashiness that preceded it. I read the last few pages and threw the book across the room. I felt cheated. I think Mr. Iles wrote himself into a corner and couldn't think of any other way to give the reader a happy ending. Gah.  Never have I been so disappointed with a novel's resolution.  Oh, and the frequent references to a novel written by a character within this novel which happens to have the same title as a novel written by Iles bugged me too.  Gah.  Oh. Go ahead and read the story. Just rewrite the ending in your own head. I did 
  I was looking for a timer that had a loud ringer I could hear from another room while cleaning, so I could check on what I'm cooking..  This one just didn't do that for me.  I notice the sound it sends out is not always the same.. sometimes it is a bit louder then other times..to me that does not do me much good..I cannot depent on it all the time!    So now I just use it to keep near me when I'm at the computer, but I do notice more of the sound comes out of the back, but then you can't see how much time you have left, if you turn it backwards!!!   The ringer goes for 1 min. This does not count backward.  The numbers and buttons are large, which is probably the reason I bought this timer.  The two magnets are not very big, and does not stay on my frig very good.  When its on my frig, and I start to press the buttons, it starts moving all over.   Price wise, this is probably a good buy , depending on what you want to use it for.   I bought another timer that the ringer is louder, but the buttons and are very small.. Guess you cannot have it all, no matter at what the price is!  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 If Alice Deejay had an ounce of credibility this would have been her release. It sounds like 2001. It's dancey pop music. It's not electro in any way.   I will try to never listen to this cd again. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the production value is above average.  I can see why young girls like this. I may give it to my niece 
 This book is very readable, but at time to time it reads very srangely. Its told in first person, then third person, and some of the plot left a yukky taste in my mouth,and was quite disbelieving. It's quite a sophomore effort from Jane Green, and lets hope with more writing practice she gets better 
 I once banged my head on a VW motor while trying to figure out how to check the oil level. Therefore, I think all Volkswagons should be destroyed as a result of them being so dangerous.  So, I cannot recommend this book 
 This book has some good information. The authors seem to be knowledgable about the technical side of photography, but don't have the eye for it 
 i ordered this, based largely on the concept, which seemed like a book on gay history that was much needed to fill in the gaps. instead, the book comes off as if Kaiser got a nice advance and then needed to submit *some* kind of manuscript, but he had lots of other things to do, so he did the absolute minimal amount of new research. instead, he relies heavily on taped interviews with 6 or 7 gay men to fill out the pages. The chapter on the '70s, one of the most important decades in gay history, has nothing more than former bartenders saying that "the Mineshaft was wild, man" and a politico friend of his talking about how he semi-came out of the closet. No sense of the "gay metropolis" here, just a random series of unconnected anecdotes. I hope he got a nice advance, but this book isn't really worth actually BUYING - just check it out at the library, in all its dismalness, and see for yourself. 
 Please, please.........  Do not buy this thing, there is a wealth of information by users out there with multiple problems and almost non-existent support.  If you do buy one - DO NOT MIRROR IT! - use it only as a storage device without any of the RAID features, otherwise you will almost certainly lose your data!  I ultimately stopped using mine and went to a USB/Firewire attached external drive enclosure, much faster a more versatile.  Good luck 
 I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused.   Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die.  Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me 
 I bought this book in hopes of finding discussion of various positions for sex during pregnancy, coupled with emotional information and guidance about sexuality. While there is a bit of that information, the bulk of the  information in the book is how to be a good OB patient. With line drawings  of episiotomies, forceps deliveries, and a few dismissive paragraphs on  home birthing and other birthing alternatives, Drs. Westheimer and  Grunebaum strive to keep women in the dark about the culmination of the  sexual act: the birth itself. If you need help in choosing an  anesthesiologist or deciding which surgical procedure should be performed  on you at birth, then buy this book. If  you're looking for good  information on intimacy during pregnancy, keep looking 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
 Last night I listened to the whole CD on Clear Channel.  (Everyone should deliberately hold off on buying a disc until they hear every song or at least a sample of every song.  It will definitely save you time and money.)  I was sorely disappointed.  There were only three songs on that disc that really resonated with me.  Once In A Lifetime, I Told You So, and Got It Right This Time.  God Made Woman was God awful.  Richard Marx had attested that Everybody rose above Better Life in quality, but I think it was lackluster in relation to Better Life.  Sorry Richard Marx fans, but this song was more Marx than Urban.  Not in a good way either.  The rest of the songs were drowned in heavy production, bland melodies, needless bridges, and repetitive lyrics.  I really expected more from Keith.  I was hoping for more guitar, rather than keyboard and piano.  I was also expecting it to sound like country, instead of saccharine laden pop.  I'm going to stick with iTunes for the tracks I do like and leave the rest by the wayside.  I'm not paying for the whole disc.  I wouldn't want anyone to have to pay full price for this record.     Music is an experimental business, much like movie making or any other type of media art.  It's a gamble really.  Sometimes you can release the best disc of your career.  An album that has one hit after another, with unlimited radio and television airplay.  Then sometimes you can release a dud.  I'm sure in Keith Urban's case, that dud will still earn him a multi-platinum CD, along with all the acoutrements of a "quality" record.  He has a hardcore mob of fans that will love anything that Urban produces, much like Richard Marx. Of course, these days, Urban beats Marx in sales of his own discs, but both artists stay in the same realm of revenue as far as being accomplished songwriters.  You can't dispute the fact that both musicians are very talented in that area.  I have to watch my words though, or some of the fans may want to verbally break my legs when I mention anything less than a perfect review of either Marx or Urban.  LOL!  (Sometimes there is no way to verbalize something so ridiculously funny.  So chatspeak has to suffice.)  Does this mean there is no accounting for taste?  Maybe.  After I wrote this review, I read similar reviews in the Boston Globe, and the Daily News.  You have to look at reviews objectively, but I think that I'm not the only one who sees the flaws.  Yet there is a contrast to those poor reviews.  Billboard, one of the most influential music publications in the world, gave it a rave review.  They said that, "it was fitting that (Keith Urban) ended the record with Got It Right This Time."  Now don't get all upset.  I still love the majority of Mr. Urban's catalogue.  (Marx's too!)  Putting aside the fact that I am a big fan of his work, I just think that Keith Urban's record went too far away from country.  Hopefully any good and bad reviews that he receives from this effort will help in the creation of his next disc.    (You may wonder why I included Richard Marx in relation to this subject, aside from the obvious connection.  From what I have observed, most of the fans that like Marx are diehard Urban fans.  Just like Rodney Crowell fans will tend to listen to Keith Urban, or the same would hold true for Dann Huff.  You connect the relative to prove your point.)  
      Overall, I found this episode in the life and adventures of Randy Komisar to be interesting, but not groundbreaking.  Though certainly filled with some valuable insights, there was something more to be desired.  There was still a lot to learn, however, the most important being the general observations from a real-life perspective on what it takes to enjoy life in the entrepreneurial world.      The work itself was often scattered and forced.  There was no real continuity between the flashbacks, often sounding as if Mr. Komisar decided to insert various triumphs in his life whenever he felt like it.  Furthermore, I found the characters of Lenny and Allison to be more symbolic than human.  They were not actual individuals, but prompts put in by Komisar to respond to the questions he wanted answered.  In his interactions with them, Komisar walked an unhealthy line between humility and arrogance, presenting himself as a sort of low-key person who thinks outside the box, yet is always right on everything and draws reverence from those around him.  At times, I wondered whether this book was more of a teaching tool or a testament to his own greatness.      I found his main message to be useful, but somewhat hypocritical.  His criticism of the "work first and then retire" philosophy struck especially close to home, as that is one I have often embraced.  I paid close attention to his words and was partially persuaded.  I think he is downright contradictory, however, when he tries to use his own life as an example of how a business does better when fueled by complete passion and the expectation of it being one's life's work.  There were many times when I felt like screaming out, "Mr. Komisar, practice what you preach!"  Furthermore, I can think of so many ways that his theory is wrong.  Sometimes, the best businessman is one who has passion for what he/she is doing, but also has the ability to be objective and analyze the situation with an objective business savvy.  When he and his mentor Campbell (of Columbia fame!) ran GO to the ground, sticking with it through its crash landing, he writes as if that is a good thing.  That is fine when you have enough money to absorb that kind of failure, but most beginning entrepreneurs do not.  Komisar got where he is because of the strategy he condemns.      The other major problem with the book is the premise of funerals.com.  I found it to be a very poor example, as it unjustly generalized the funeral market.  While I am sure there are funeral homes who take advantage of people in their vulnerable, grieving states, I cannot think of anything less comforting than making arrangements over a computer instead of with people.  The character of Allison in representing the opposite extreme really represented absurdity.  If she were so feeling and caring, why not establish a not-for-profit website for grieving families?  I was never convinced that they were after anything but money, and the only evidence that their purpose was primarily moral was Komisar merely claiming it.  If this had been some kind of technological advancement in medicine, for instance, then I could have understood the enduring desire to save lives while also profiting.  The funeral example, however, is weak at best, and so is the pathetic Celestine Prophecy/Richest Man in Babylon rip-off with the riddle.      The strength of the book is in Komisar's thoughts about achieving happiness in life rather than about success in business.  Unlike the other characters, I was able to connect with Komisar as a human being, experimenting with different companies and developing his own tastes.  I gained a lot from reading his experiences, even if they were disjointed, and while I may have disagreed with him on some points, I learned from them.  I am glad I read the book, found it useful, but would hardly call it a masterpiece. 
 I ordered this book with high hopes.  The reviews led me to believe it offered concrete suggestions for pressing problems.  It just isn't so.  This book seems to be primarily for people who want to rationalize the status quo: others suffer for reasons you can't influence, you are a good person for just talking about problems in the world while doing nothing about them, etc.  If you believe people who suffer get what they deserve or are simply a side-effect of the glorious free market then this book will be laughable to you.  If you believe making the world better for everyone is the primary obligation for members of "good society" then this book will be disappointing to you.  Etzioni mouths some standard platitudes, for example that we need universal health care, but inevitably either guts his statements by describing that he means something entirely different from what is understood by those statements or he backpedals furiously.  Sometimes he does both at once.  Here's a prime example, again regarding health care: "However, securing everyone a rich basic minimum of health care as a start should no longer be delayed if we seriously seek to move toward a good society".  What exactly is the oxymoronic "rich basic minimum" to which he refers?  We just don't know, and subsequent pages are no help.  As Etzioni reminds us often, this is something for further discussion (outside his book, of course) and dialogue.  From the merely comical "rich basic minimum", we move to the stunningly wrongheaded comment that "there is a profound tension between treating people as ends and as a source of profit".  There is nothing profound about this, nor is there tension except when the market is allowed to have its way with few controls.  Rather than taking the much more "people as ends" focused view that the market must serve society and must be constrained when it fails in that role, Etzioni asks us to believe that we shouldn't always treat other people as people - sometimes they really are commodities to be bought and sold for money.  Perhaps I am especially disappointed because I had such high hopes for this book.  I'm sticking with Amartya Sen and Wendell Berry because even if I don't always agree with them, I can always tell that they care deeply for others and want to offer suggestions for improving the world, not empty cliches 
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 I had high hopes for this book as I thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way.  At first, I thought I agreed with the 'accepting of self' philosophy, but gradually statements made by the author just didn't ring true.  I kept on thinking that maybe I was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes, but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author's response was that she had control issues (!?!) and was acting like a victim.  I think at that moment, perhaps she feeling victimized.  But instead of telling her to 'embrace her victim', she is a control freak. Then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice, instead of a chemical imbalance.  Perhaps depression can spawn creativity, but you have to be able to get out of bed first -- and that is a problem.  I gave up on the book after that 
 The current, non-DirecTV system, updated by satellite, is actually 7.1 (as of 9 August 2005). I haven't found that any of the hacking books are especialy useful for Series 2 boxes, especially as the software upgrades 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 [note: I am the same reviewer IP_Geek, but Amazon only lets you review once, so this is follow up] Despite what Dr. Michael G. Mathews may believe, I really wanted to use my real name, and I have never worked for Exodus (although they may have been a customer of one of the companies I worked for, unknown to me).  I have worked at 4 networking vendor/manufacturer companies, of which 2 were data vendors (routers/switches) and 2 VoIP companies.  I currently work at a vendor who makes VoIP security products, and thus I felt it a bit unfair/dangerous to my employer to critique any book in a public forum. (because you can google my name and find out where I work) I still feel that way, so I will try to convince you I have no agenda as easily as I can as follows: 1) My argument was simply that you should VERY carefully read the table of contents, including the page numbers.  Dr. Mathews is quite right that this type of book will appeal to some people, just that in my humble opinion I hope those people are not put in charge of securing VoIP, because this book doesn't do it. (see below why) 2) I did not slam the authors in person or capabilities - I slammed the book they wrote.  This book was published fairly recently (6 months ago), and this book is written from a VoIP perspective of several years ago, in my opinion.  It is missing tons, and contains lots of frankly irrelevant content to the subject.  If the title of the book "VoIP Security" is not meant to actually mean this is a book about VoIP Security, then I guess I don't understand what book titles are for.  The back cover even says "This book will teach you how to plan for and implement VoIP security solutions...".  I am taking issue with that statement, not the authors personally. 3) I think some people may like the book, because they are not already experts in VoIP security and thus don't know what they're missing.  I believe I am pretty close to an expert.  I was looking for a book I could recommend to my customers and colleagues who are not. 4) Dr. Mathews says "It addresses the protocol specifics, the technical issues, and the security options surrounding the protocol."  I think that it addresses them if you don't know what they really are.  I will tell you what I know is missing from this book: a) TLS.  Much of the VoIP industry believes TLS to be the future panacea for VoIP service security. (it's not used much today, but many are moving that way)  That belief is true for eavesdropping protection/privacy, and server-side authentication.  It is not true for DoS/DDoS attack protection, or user-side authentication.  It is also not true for fraud prevention, and it adds many scalability/performance issues.  The reasons for that, how SIP over TLS works at a protocol level, and more interestingly the security issues around it are not addressed in this book.  That should be a whole chapter. As a side note, they say TLS requires TCP, which was true until the draft for DTLS came out for TLS over UDP, which has received much publicity in the VoIP security world.  It came out in 2003 - long before this book was finished.  b) IPSec.  The 3GPP/IMS world and some inter-carrier VoIP peering uses IPSec to secure VoIP, which like TLS only provides some security features/benefits but not others.  Used by enterprises it also adds latency to RTP (because they use it in tunnel mode over TCP).  I give the authors some credit - they did spend 10 pages on the VPN issues with IPsec (but it's not exactly how 3GPP uses it).  I still think this topic should be a whole chapter. c) SRTP.  How SRTP is performed, from a protocol level and hardware/software level, leaves much to be desired.  There is in fact much debate in the industry if it is needed at all, how it can be managed, how CALEA can be supported with it, etc.  SRTP also does not protect the gateways/phones, and the implementation of it is the critical piece as to whether it's any good at all.  The authors spend a couple pages on it - I would probably spend at least half a chapter on it - perhaps by removing the big section on how codecs work (which has virtually no relevance to VoIP security compared to this list).  The fact there are different codecs is important, but not the formulas for the plot curves of A-law and u-LAw! d) S/MIME.  Some voip products do it, but most don't, and it breaks some things.  Again, the protocol and security issues with S/MIME are not covered in much detail in this book. (although it's covered over at least a few pages, just not enough I think)  e) VoIP Firewalls.  One simply cannot lump that into one group.  The differences in feature/architecture/functionality between categories of friewalls (not to mention models/brands), and how you use VoIP with them, is so critical I'm literally shocked there isn't a ton more detail on this.  Look at other security books for data.  There are entire books about just a particular firewall brand. (not that this book should get to that level of detail) f) STUN/TURN/ICE.  They are mentioned briefly, but really these technologies/protocols are another pandora's box of security issues, and should be addressed if crossing NAT's is at all useful for you.  Likewise, Session Border Controllers are mentioned briefly in this book, but they are considered by most to be one of the fundamental pieces in VoIP security.  ok, enough time spent.  I'm sorry for the length of this reply.  Again, this book may appeal to you (to each his own), I just caution you that there is a lot more under the Voip security hood than is mentioned in this book. I'm sure the authors are good guys - perhaps they wrote this book a long time ago and printing/publishing books is just too much delay to keep up with technology.  (although I'm still struggling to understand how 30 pages of codec waveform detail helps any voip security person 
 I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello and ran to the shop as soon as I read the great reviews of this album, what a mistake!!!   Very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version. The cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody.  Elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.  For me,'Hora Decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 A relatively enjoyable book.  The numerous narrow escapes and quasi-scientific plot is a little thin.  Most of the stuff is not beleivable.  His first books were a bit better thought out.  He needs a break and a strong effort on his next book 
 The numerous historical inaccurracies are already outlined in other reviews.   Political correctness and post Cold War jingoism maquerading as hindsight are to blame for this farce of a war movie. Some of the historic elements (like Stalin's "not one step back" order, etc) are haphazardly crammed into a few opening scenes, creating an anachronistic mess. Unfortunately, there aren't many Soviet perspective films on Stalingrad to choose from.  Would recommend this film to those looking for simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment with the novelty of a war movie that's not from the "usual" U.S. or German WWII perspective. Would not recommend it for anyone interested in historical accuracy or complex and original plotlines 
 There are two main female characters in the plot: one is a man-eater who will sleep her way to the top (although she may not even need it because she is good independently) and the other is the jealous and depressed housewife who gave up her career for the sake of her husband's. This is a man's fantasy and nightmare come true in one; and a boring cliche for all the intelligent and responsible females of the world. To all the Hollywood men out there: You can't brainwash us anymore with your b/s; okay?? 
 I have finally finished reading this book, and in my opinion, it's not worth picking up.  Many, many inaccuracies...with not much covered that hasn't already been published.  I was hoping this book would go into a little more depth about his life between 'The Big Trail' and 'Stagecoach'.  Things like how he felt about going to Paramount and playing 2nd lead to Johnny Mack Brown in 'Helltown',  or what was going on in his life when he decided to leave Republic in 1936, and try making non-westerns for Universal.     This book is more like reading a pamphlet about John Wayne, then any kind of biography.  And the title is a misnomer...the book covers his entire life, not just his younger years.   A real disappointment.  
 I found this to be excruciatingly boring. The material is at best obsolete and of little value. A waste of time and money and not appropriate to one searching for a history of Jesus 
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 Will, a neoconservative often mistaken for a conservative of the old mold, presents his case for the Leviathan state.  To Will, if government is good, then more government is better.  He sees the state as the rightful architect of society, trusting politicians and bureaucrats to steer the proles along the path to greatness, meaning Empire.  I regard neoconservatives as Judas goats;  Will is a prime example.  This is the man who, a few years ago, said that it is time America repealed "the embarrassing Second Amendment.&quot 
 Could fall asleep easily. Reminds me of poly. sci. 101 The Q & A session in the end is good.  
 There is a saying that Hawkins apparently has no knowledge of.     "If you wish to know where the sparrow flies... ask the sparrow."    Most of the mis-information in this book is the same old tired arguements against Wicca and Paganism that have been regurgitated for years by Christians. Most of Hawkin's arguements are meaningless to anyone who is not already a Christian. These arguements are presented as if the precepts of Christianity were proven "truth", and any other religious concepts are therefore false. What Hawkins fails to recognise is that the Christian precepts he uses are not proven, and indeed cannot be shown to be more valid that the religions he decrys, thus his arguements are flawed from the outset. Wiccans , and adherants of any other religion for that matter, can easily recognise this type of fallacy, and so anyone trying to use the "truth" of Christianity to disprove Wicca will be simply dismissed from the outset.    This book is simply a tool to make Christians feel better about themselves, while demonising another religion. If you think you can use this book to "save" your children or friend from Wicca... then you are probably the reason they rejected Christianity in the first place 
 The book should be lsted as fiction, and not under history or theology. Mr. Kennedy should keep his act to the TV, where he can present baseless facts. His subjective biased argument does not help in promoting christanity, a more obejective would. "A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom" by ANDREW DICKSON WHITE does a far better job in presenting an objective analysis on impact of christanity on science. Struggle of Gallileo with the chruch is complete mis-presented by Mr. Kennedy 
 This book is a quick and fun read. The first problem to be faced is that Daniel Queller in 1978 wrote a book that covers almost exactly the same ground except for Phillips last two chapters on the Latin Empire after the Crusade.  In 1978 when first published, Queller's thesis regarding the "accidental" nature of the 4th Crusade's final destination was sensational.  His conclusions were opposed to Runcimen, Norwich and others.  Queller offered a persuasive revisionist history of the 4th Crusade. The second problem is that in 1997, Queller and Thomas Madden, updated and reissued the 1978 work under the title, "The 4th Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople," and it a far superior book to this one.  The third problem is that, to the best of my knowledge, there is not an original thought in Phillip's book.  So, where do the two stars come from?  One of the stars is issued for a generally readable and accurate assessment of the 4th Crusade that is derivative from other secondary sources. The second star is earned for the extensive translated quotes from the actual crusaders, Greeks, and other contemporaries involved with or around this incident.  This helps illuminate the thinking of those involved within their own cultures and time. From there it is downhill.  The last two chapters on the end of the Crusade and the Latin Empire are weak and weaker.  The book occassionally delves off into tenuously related sidetracks.  No author should use the same quotes more than once in a book.  Phillips manages to do this on at least two occassions.  There are other indications of sloppy editorial work, but I will not enumerate them.  Phillips uses 21st Century analogies gratuitously and unenlighteningly. Peguin published the paperback on lousy paper, with weak print density, and almost no white space.  I suggest you buy Qeuller and Madden's book on this topic.  However, if you prefer, you may buy this inferior mirror image of their book.  I wish I could be kinder to this book.  It is far better that you read this book rather than nothing at all as this is important material seldom approached. At least, we can be thankful that Phillips did not rewrite Runcimen and Norwich on the topic.  Then his book would not have been only generally derivative but historically inaccurate as well.      
     I can't remember when I was more angry at the ending of a book.  When I finished THE GRAVE MAURICE I swore that I would never read another Martha Grimes book, and so far I haven't.  I admit I miss Richard Jury and Melrose Plant as I would any other old friends, but I am tired of endings that feel like a kick in the stomach!  So, no more Martha.  I will find new friends elsewhere 
 It is a well written book with good instructions but I really did not see any of the project that I would want to build. I think a bit more imagination as well as some ways to dress up the projects would have made the book a bit more useful 
 twirls and lutzes? No such thing as twirls and lutzes aren't for kids who have never skated. There are so many basics to be learned that all children will be doing is hopping and gliding and ducking for a while 
  From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read. 
 IF THIS BOOK IS NEW, IT IS SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE A REGISTRATION CODE FOR THE PUBLISHERS ONLINE HOMEWORK (REQUIRED IN ACCT4A). THE PUBLISHERS WEB SITE SAYS THIS INFORMATION!!!!!! I RECIEVED IT WITH NOTHING. THEY SHRINK WRAP IT THEMSELVES (EASY TO DO). PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.  FEEL FREE TO ASK ME QUESTION 
 This book is so stupid! I don't understand how this book got 4.5 stars? Most of the book is not even about programing!? Its like a novel 
 The first 2 books in Lackey's Dragonjouster series were excellent.  The author created a new world, new scenarios, new theme and did them well.  Imagine my surprise when I read 'Sanctuary' the third installment in this series.  It seems that the author, after throwing herself fully into the first 2 books, has lost interest in them and was mainly just trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible and finish the series.  'Sanctuary' could have been a satisfying end to Vetch/Kiron's story...as it was, I was left wanting... 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 good movie, bad copy!  I ordered it because it was cheap.  However, picture quality is POOR; fuzzy, washed-out, blurry.  It looks like it's recorded in superlongplay.  The shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this 
 It is odd, and perhaps a bit sad, that John Irving has become or became American's literary sweetheart.  Given his narrative concerns, it would seem a wide readership would have never been his fate.  For one, he is fixated on the mutilation of the human body.  This mania with mutilation borders on the near fantastic in The World According to Garp. And more disturbingly still, is it completely infiltrates the narrative's sense of sexuality.  For the narrator of Garp, sex and bodily mutilation are nearly synonymous.  And what is the purpose of this overall fixation with the lopping off of limbs and the act of sex?  In The World According to Garp, sex is not viewed as a healthy or even human impulse.  It is only when the major characters divest themselves of lust, or sexual activity, that they extricate themselves from most of their mental woes.  It's a grim vision.  It is hard to envision flocks of readers gobbling this book in the late 70's and early 80's and viewing it as the great voice of our (or their) time.  The novel is also written on a high level of generality.  No reader should expect to plumb very deeply into the human condition in this novel.  Like Garp's writing itself, Irving's prose is witty and salacious, but never really gives the reader any serious human dilemma to masticate and digest.  There is something to chew, but it is light fare.  
 I picked this book up in the library expecting because it seemed to have similar elements to a book I am writing. Hopefully my book won't come out this way. Cambell spends far too much time showing us the inner workings of a family we don't particularly care about and not enough time building our interest in what is in the woods. I didn't even stick around to find out. 
 It pains me to write it, but this book was bad. I thoroughly enjoy most of Douglas Adams' work especially the Hitchhiker's series. Unfortunately, he missed the mark with this book. I personally believe Adams wanted this book to be very funny, ala, the Hitchhiker books (others disagree), since it was: strike one. The storyline was quite complex, which would be fine, but I'm not 100% certain this is what Adams was trying to do: strike two. Finally, Dirk Gentry just is not equal to Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect (Hitchhiker's main characters) in terms of full, colorful characters, the final strike. Maybe it was my high expectations after reading the Hitchhiker series, which I found incredibly entertaining at 14, 24 and 34 years of age (for different reasons) 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 The book opens with horror stories about cows and how they are given[chemicals] to fatten them up and keep them healthly.  Then it moves on the chickens and the horrible conditions they are raised in. The third story is about a vegetarian and how much better his diet is.  I already knew that cows and chickens were not the best and were given [chemicals] I don't want in my body, I didn't need the graphic descriptions.  Much of the information was wonderful, the explanation about protein and simple vs. complete protein was very interesting.   I am an avid reader, but I found this hard to follow, and didn't retain the information.  Having to trudge through the chapters made each new page harder to face.  I couldn't force myself to continue to read.  A book isn't a good resource when you can't recall this inforation or dread having to slog through half of the book to find the one paragraph you need 
 I thought this book would have information and some facts about how animals help humans, but it doesn't. It is just about her life. Only buy if you are interested in learning about this woman's life. 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 Simply not enough of Amy Weber in the film. In the scenes she was in she looked lovely, but I was hoping to see more. Anyone hoping to see Weber get down and dirty will be disappointed 
 While the author provides a good, concise overview of NFP techniques, she makes some assertions that are not supported by scientific evidence.  For example: 1) Trying to conceive immediately after discontinuing the Pill often results in miscarriage...FALSE.  The main reason many gynos recommend waiting is so you can better determine when you are ovulating, as you may be anovulatory for a few cycles post-Pill. 2)Chapter on regulating cycles with light...references research back in the 70s.  If this truly had merit, I think the body of work would be greater. 3)Chapter on choosing the baby's sex - relies on the Shettles method, also from the 70s.  It has since been proven that his assertion that "X" sperm are slower moving and larger and "Y" sperm are faster moving and smaller is incorrect.  The only somewhat reliable sex selection techniques involve laboratory assistance.  There are better NFP books out there, namely: "Natural Birth Control Made Simple" Kass-Anesse/Danzer (still a little preachy) "The Fastest Way to Get Pregnant Naturally" Williams (if this is your goal, if you're looking for contraception, maybe not the best! 
 It has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher.  Antony Flew, the world's number one atheist (at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments) has recanted his atheism.    Philosophically, Flew was a rationalist.  Having accepted the empirical evidence of intelligent design in nature, he was able to liberate himself from the tunnel vision of rationalism and hence from the shackles of irrational atheism.  Flew himself would give this book one star.  So, I don't think it ungracious to do the same 
 The film deserves 5 stars but the DVD only gets 1.  Why:  no letterbox format.  After waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on DVD, why would they give us full screen / pan & scan?  Yes, the quality and color are great but oh, what we're missing on the sidelines 
 This review is for the Audio Version only.  We've probably all had the experience of reading a letter with a tone not intended by the author, which resulted in a huge misunderstanding of the writer's intent.  Well, the content of this book may actually be fine, but you may very well not gain any value from it should you purchase the audio version.  Although the reader has clear, defined diction and well-measureed flow to her speech, she utilizes a snooty, condescending, and utterly acerbic tone throughout her reading of the book, making it almost impossible to listen to.  It's like being scolded for 3 1/2 hours, and so relentlessly that you miss the message and hear only contempt.  Whilst going through this program I repeatedly had to stop the CD for the purpose of trying to picture the words in print. I would then realize that had I been reading the same text, I would not have intonated so nastily, and would then not find the content so utterly offensive.  I cannot say with any certainty to what degree the reader reflected the actual attitudes of the author. The author does express considerable disdain for people with easy-going dispositions, as well as those in middle management and other less lofty positions in the business world.  It could be that the tone of her reading was exactly what was asked for.   On the other hand, people pleasers need to learn that they do not need to be liked by everyone.  Therefore, having to endure the beration of the reader may well be good practice in not running away from uncomfortable feelings -- or in searching for a way to appease the displeased.  Whatever the case, those who have a problem with being pathologically nice may well have a problem with the audio version.  That is way too bad, because audiobooks are so convenient for this sort of material. In this particular case, I warn against the audio edition.  Read it instead 
 If an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery, you'd think they'd have a lo say about it, right? Well, Ford certainly expends plenty of words, but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories. Mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament, the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white, middle-aged, married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity. Story after story plods cautiously along, poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way, with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness. Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male. Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons, and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it. I have no idea what his personal background or situation is, but it's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something. If he wasn't such a literary bigshot, there's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over, and isn't provocative, insightful, or even interesting. PS. If you were planning on the audio version, don't. Ford is a terrible reader, sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment 
 This book reads as if it were written to fulfill a thesis requirement, and not out of love for the banjo.  The author only touches on banjo technique and music, instead she prefers to base her arguments on iconography.  I gave it two stars since it provides some interesting perspectives on race relations in the U.S., but it severely falls short for anyone who loves banjo music and the instrument itself 
 the sheets say they are sateen, but feel more like basic cotton or flannel.  Since I was really going for that cotton sateen feel, i'm not impressed.   i have a queen sized bed and have not had any problems getting the sheets to fit on the bed - even after washing - as some other reviews stated.  
 Horror movies used to be known as such because they were scary or instilled people with fear.  Fear of a villain or evil was usually the source...classic horror movies like "The Shining", "Halloween", "Psycho", "The Omen", and "The Exorcist" are great examples of such films.  Then, along came the advent of films like "Sleepaway Camp II", films that shall we say, did not take themselves very seriously.  Frankly, I prefer the former to the latter.  Perhaps, I'm in the minority though as I see that "Sleepaway Camp II- Unhappy Campers" gets high reviews from most reviewers.    The first "Sleepaway Camp" was not very good to begin with, but it did have a sense of darkness to it...a sense of creepiness about it that allowed the film to elicit some, albeit, rather pedestrian horror in the viewer.  "Sleepaway Camp II- Unhappy Campers" does not have the same atmosphere or goals as its predecessor.  In fact, what you really have in "Sleepaway Camp II" is a movie where Angela kills the "bad campers", e.g. the sex-crazed teens, drug users, tattle-tales, etc., etc.  Of course, Angela takes things too far, and things catch up with her.  Pamela Springsteen comes across as this cute girl who wouldn't hurt a fly, but she is so dangerous according to this movie as Angela.  Frankly, I don't believe Angela is physically capable of hurting a fly as she is portrayed in this movie which makes this movie all the more ridiculous.  Her actions and disposition do not fit the brutality of these crimes.  For example, she swings about as hard a tee-baller when she chops off some guy's head with a machete.  I mean do you really think a girl like that could get away with, much less conduct such vicious murders...it just doesn't fly in my book folks.  In fact, it's ridiculous.  Indeed, the movie is just laughable when you think about it, but maybe that's what the creators were after in this crap.  "Sleepaway Camp II" really is more of a comedy than a horror movie no matter how you look at it.  In fact, there is nothing horrifying about this movie.    Admittedly, I was mildly entertained while watching this joke of a flick.  For all of its flaws, it is kind of funny in a pathetic kind of way.  However, I love horror movies and that's what I want to watch, and you don't get that in this flick...period!  What you do get is horrendous acting, incredulous plot, unrealistic kills, plenty of mullets (I like T.C.'s the best) and a whole helluva a lot of cheese.  If you like this kind of thing, good for you as you will have a great time.  As for me, I will continue to enjoy the likes of "The Shining" and "The Exorcist", and maybe one day, I will come upon another diamond in the rough like "Black Christmas".  Then again, if any of the last few movies that I've watched for the first time are any indication of the selection of what's out there, I may be looking for an awfully long time.  "Sleepaway Camp II- Unhappy Campers" does not instill me with a lot of confidence in the reviewers' taste for what constitutes a good horror movie.  
 I was looking for something new in ethnic music, and despite the reviews, for me this absolutely wasn't it.  I am sure if I enjoyed dance music more, this would be better, but if you're looking to experiment, I highly recommend listening first before you buy!  There are other good examples of ethnic European/Middle Eastern fusion that are simply easier on the ears.  That said, I'm sure Balkan Beat Box is great for what it is, if it's your thing 
 Starting from the premise that what is recorded in the bible as the quoted words and deeds of Jesus may not be accurately reported, is a significant problem with this work.  Mr. Funk, et al., seem to approach the NT biblical accounts from a negative starting point, content with attempting to disprove rather than prove its content under the guise of serious academic considerations.  In addition, the "scholars" cited as part of this work are of minor biblical scholarship consequence and the method of "scholarly agreement by consensus" employed by Mr. Funk and the rest is of very questionable note 
 I admit that I'm a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, but this wasn't anywhere near one of his best.  He IS adorable in the movie, but the plot is extremely corny, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud.  Guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini-sporting girls, but not much else.  Although there are a few remotely funny parts, it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is.  But then again, it was worth it to watch Johnny 
 This  is by far the worst book on the subject of control systems ever printed.  I can't believe my professor in college assigned us this book knowing how bad it was.  Maybe there wasn't anything else available at the time...(1996).  I seriously doubt this.  The publisher's did a mickey mouse job putting it together, from the binding to the orientation of the pages.  Typos are everywhere and formulas are wrong.  Nothing looks right and neither do the concepts.  The book looks like it was made in someone's garage.  This book wins the prize for worst book of the millenium in my view.  If you have this book, throw it away.  Don't bother recycling the paper - it's not worth it. Get another one.  
 The plot is UNEXPECTED, that i am not sure if it's good or not! I mean it's good that they get everyone surprised. But come on, SUPERMAN had a son with Lois Lane, but Lois Lane is marry to Perry White's Nephew??? THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT! LOIS LANE & CLARK KENT was "THE COUPLE"! How can they change something so wonderful to make it so STUPID. I think that's an INSULT to the love legend of 'Lois and Clark'! Anyway, as for the cast, ROUTH & BOSWORTH is NOT WORKING as CLARK KENT & LOIS LANE! They have no chemistry, no fire, not even a spark at all. Also, I think their acting skill is not very good (to be honest)! Oh yeah, I still have NO CLUE why they hire Bosworth to be Lois Lane, i mean she can't even act half as good as Teri Hatcher! Plus she DOES NOT even look like a Lois Lans. I mean there are so many actress i think they can do better, like 'Jennifer Connelly'(at least Connelly can really act and got the look like lois Lane, plus I BET she can pass off as Lois Lane WAY MUCH BETTER!) As for ROUTH, to be honest, i think he is just a pretty boy! I really don't think he's a good actor! (i have to say he better looking than Christopher Reeve, i'll give him that. So thanks to his face, he works as superman 
  About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food, for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.                                             --Hebrews 5:11-14  I picked this book up because I've heard the author speak and have much respect for him; he is smart and well-spoken.  But I was sorely disappointed by this book.  Its advice is shallow and tired; I've heard it all before a hundred times.   It's not bad advice, it's just... milk.  The same old basic things any pastor includes in a sermon on marriage: listen to your parents, love is a choice, die to yourself, etc.  Blah blah blah.    Worse yet, his use of scripture is shallow and questionable.  He's one of those authors that offers an interpretation of scripture that might be true as if it is inarguably true.  I need the arguments.  I want to be convinced.    I suppose there's nothing wrong with milk.  Certainly there are people who need it before they can get to solid food.  But I expected more from Mr. Zacharias.    (Disclaimer: I only made it through 100 pages of this book - which is more than halfway - before I decided there would be better ways to spend my time.)     
 Purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers.  Wanting to check out what I purchased, I opened one of the five.   The geodes are tiny (not as pictured).  It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals.  Maybe it was a "dud" box, but will probably be returning the other four. 
 Dalrymple believes that reasons (excuses) for taking drugs are self-serving and imply lack of control and lack of blame.  Evidence offered include the statement that people exposed to strong opiates in medical circumstances rarely become addicted (why, then, is treatment access so restricted?) - but offers no statistics.  As for addicts needing to steal to support their habits - he cites an English study finding that only one-fifth of those addicted could not funtion at work - such a finding proves nothing about those who are.  Providing medical treatment (eg. methadone) for addicts as a means of reducing crime is another "no-no" per Dalrymple.  Here he cites a study that concluded that reducing heroin-taking REDUCED, but did not eliminate crime - so lacking a perfect solution we should do nothing?  Dalrymple also holds that the "help experts" have a vested interest in continuing treatment.  He reports the story of thousands of American soldiers taking heroin in Vietnam (supposedly 43% - seems unbelievable to me, and I was there) with 20% clinically qualified as addicts; only one in eight continued upon return to the U.S. and within 2-3 years the rate of use fell to that of peers eligible, but not selected in the draft.  (Sounds good, but I've never heard this story before.)  Bottom Line:  Dalrymple's frequent sarcasm is not appropriate for a serious subject and makes me wonder how objective his thinking is; in addition, his logic is at least sometimes questionable, and he rarely cites opposing studies like objective writers do 
 "Just Enough" is more than enough:  A turgid, pretentious, strident, and wholly unoriginal piece of work.  Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature. At best, this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the Harvard Business Review, but surely not enough material for 280 pages!  Better to read "Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow : Discovering Your Right Livelihood," by MARSHA SINETAR, and call it a day 
 This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification 
 This very detailed history suffers from several omissions: 1.  While describing complicated military maneuvers, there are no maps to enable the reader to follow what is happening. 2.  There are no notes to the text despite numerous references to obscure events. 3.  The author seems obsessed with his own erudtion, leaving the reader to flounder amongst the excessive and superfluous details 
 This quick-read is a cheap thrill. It has some eloquent prose and an interesting premise; however, the story as a whole is marginal and actually quite banal. The author seems almost desperate to convey "realism", but relying on photographic descriptions of sexual acts and equally graphic renditions of sadistic brutality are simply not enough to make this story exceptional.   The protagonist, Frannie, is "too constructed" to seem real. Her extreme cynicism is perhaps refreshing at times and her linguistic ponderings are often quite amusing, but overall her personality is meatless. The lover/detective Malloy is a tired police cliche with a knack for some extreme sexual precision. Frannie's student Cornelius shows some potential as a character but quickly disintegrates.  The ending is quite over-hyped and actually rather disappointing. Blood and gore and a meager "explaination" - wow, what a surprise...  Overall, Susanna Moore shows us in this book that she can be clever with words; however, her attempt to portray gritty reality comes across as merely desperate for attentio 
 I bought the Chop Wizard thinking it would save me time in the kitchen, but it hasn't.  Food has to be prepared (destemmed, decored, sliced, etc.) before going in the device to the extent that I might as well do all the work with my knife and cutting board.  Depending on the food, cleanup can be a hassle too.  Last night, I spend ~ 2 minutes using the cleaning comb accessory to get sweet potato out of the plastic grid on the underside of the lid.  I feel guilty for adding to the waste stream with this device that in my opinion is an insult to the tried and true, fast and easy, cheap and simple knife and cutting board 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 I don't quite understand how this film can be called Chilling! Heath Ledger is a good actor but I hate to see that he agreed to make such a boring movie. He plays a priest who is sent to Rome to investigate the death of a highly revered priest. I suffered through this film only because I had spent the money to buy it... luckily previously viewed so it was pretty cheap in price. I couldn't wait until this movie was over with. I don't even consider this movie a thriller. I don't recommend anyone waste their money on this movie 
 Over the years Michael Crichton has provided some fine entertainment, but you have to wonder exactly when it became federal law that "techno-thrillers" must be stiff and awkward, serving up by-the-numbers storytelling, typecast characters and humdrum dialogue.  Not zipping along, spirited and alive, and intelligent, but rather mechanically sputtering and clanking along Bestseller Trail, like, say, a big clumsy runaway swarm of self-sustaining nanoparticles on their way to absorbing their first desert bunny.   Not that this killer-micro-robots-on-the-swarm idea isn't worthy, and just the sort of thing that humans would knowingly or unknowingly unleash. But, to take one example, the lead character is this cutting-edge evolutionary-nanoparticle predator-prey computer programmer, with kids, cute kids, and a wife, a very lovely wife.  After numerous strange occurrences (sure, there might be some short period of denial), wouldn't any one of us become hyper-alert, especially when family safety is involved? Not our boy Jack.  This savior of humankind seems more like Homer Simpson distractedly searching for a lost jelly doughnut.  Why would such an intelligent writer create so torpid a hero?  Because Jack is Everyman?  (Wouldn't say much for Crichton's view of Everyman.) But then why make him so otherwise brilliant?  As far as the plot is concerned, it isn't as if there aren't some unique and fascinating ideas here, but once they are dropped down the hopper of the grinding Techo-Thriller-0-Matic, what comes out seems so much like what we've trudged through before.  That Crichton can take subjects this technically obscure and turn them into popular novels, then movies, is commendable. We definitely learn more about artificial intelligence, nanoparticles and predator-prey behavior. However, it would be helpful if such an accomplished author were to take at least half the energy he devotes to periodically stopping the action to explain arcane technology, and shift it to creating gripping, more believable plots, vivid detail (the more fantastic the story, the greater the need for convincing, if limited, detail), life-like idiosyncratic characters and crisp intelligent dialogue. This would allow new scientific concepts to filter down quietly, almost unnoticed, into the minds of readers who are deeply involved in the story.  "Every attempt to destroy them has failed. And we are their prey," says the back-cover blurb, apparently referring to the plucky micro-robots, rather than another of these clunky techno-thriller formats they are forced to inhabit. Run, reader, run!  
 Boy, what a complete joke this book is... one of the WORST purchases I have made in a long time. Buyer Beware: A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!! 
 I wasn't thrilled with the CD, and when I lent it to someone at work the review I got back was "it has no soul". I think that explains it perfectly. It does not, in fact, swing. Set this side by side with the music it was based on, or some of Bireli Lagrene's Gypsy jazz, and it comes up short all the way around. I might have given it two stars, but I feel that the 5-star rating needs to be corrected 
 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 I've read a few books of all kinds.  "Modern Pace Handicapping" is one of the worst, frankly, which makes it definitely the worst racing-related book I've ever read.  It's particularly sad when it is supposed to be teaching you something and not just narrating a story.  I understand the concept of pace handicapping, but the nuts and bolts hardly fit together in this work.  I'm surprised I got any theory out of this book at all.  It is truly one of the most poorly written/edited/formatted/arranged books I've run across.  It is shocking this book gets so many rave reviews.  "MPH" is so badly written I can only assume the people giving it 4+ stars are already well-versed in pace handicapping and skipped over all the incomprehensible stuff and the myriad mistakes and horrible copies.  If I wanted to spend more time I could give specific examples by leafing any given page in the book.  However, I'll just sum up by saying this book was riddled with:  -typos; -chopped-off paragraphs (turn the page - what happened?); -confusing mish-mash of decimal system proper, and using decimal notation to represent FIFTHS (i.e., 1:35.3 = 1:35-3/5 in one section, and in another it represents exactly what it looks like to an engineer like myself - 1:35-3/10); -many extremely poor (completely illegible, high-bleed) copies of old race charts; -poor math-checking - both of equation form and of results in examples; -disconnected charts to text (text discussion on page X, charts were on page X-5, etc); -poor explanation of either general theory, methods or examples - especially - WHY SHOULD I PICK THIS OR THAT RACE AS A TYPICAL PACELINE?  Author acts as if it is so obvious and simply states "this should be the paceline" too many times.  I could probably go on; I always manage to find a new glitch when I recommence reading.  There are so many categories of problems that I cannot keep track of them all.  I'm not sure if "Modern Pace Handicapping" is so poorly edited and explained that I find it hard to pick UP (as opposed to "hard to put down!"), or if I can really say the narrative style itself is so dry as to have made me take 2 years to read it on casual time.  (Not finished yet - a few more chapters, which may mean another 6 months.)  I have started and finished a couple other books on casual time in that period!  It is almost with dread that I attempt again.  I give it a 2 only because I could actually get the general idea from MPH.  I think I could handle calculations, but I'm still confused as to why a particular race in the past-performances is good to use as a predictor for the future race analysis.  The Andrew Beyer books are based on a different concept, but despite involving math and what could be a dry subject, they were definitely better written and MUCH better edited (and as with this subject, I knew little about it when beginning but was curious) 
 Ok well this book SUCKED!!! It's all about baribie kara. I was actully at first thinking Kara wasn't that bad for a character but beacause of this book now I think shes not a good character anymore. This book made me got really dissapionted. I really like the series and I will still continue reading the series but if she is going to steal Emily's horn AGAIN then I might as well not read anymore books about Kara. 
 I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John) 
 Don't buy this. There are deaf toddlers who can record my voice better than this microphone 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 'Why I'm Not a Catholic but Still Insist I Am" would be a much better title. For somebody who claims to know so much about the Catholic faith (and disagree with so many of the Church's teachings), it's truly laughable for him to write a book in which he claims to be a Catholic 
 This is the last book I will attempt to read in this series. I previously stated on my last book  review that the series was becoming repetitive and I felt the author was attempting to drag out the story line to fill a certain amount of books due her contract. I could not even read this entire book. I am just happy that I did not purchase this as I have done so in the past. This series has become a soap opera with a occasional Amen. I feel this author has fallen from her graces that her previous books had provided. I would not recommend to anyone 
 It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. The shipping was fast and the price was right 
 This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!   
 When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture.  After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever.  The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures! They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera. 
 Other than the genuinely great remix of Atomic by Diddy, the remixes here are highly forgetable. Most remixes completely miss the point of the orginal tracks and sound like they were slapped together very quickly for a quick buck.  Avoid 
 From my perspective this is a quite average book. You find some interesting charts and amazing facts. But in fact the book is riding the commodity investment theme. Apart from this there is little discussion which companies will profit from a rising Asia.. 
 It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.  The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes.  Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost.  
 The author does an acceptable job of presenting _what_ his opinion is, but a very poor job of explaining _why_ anyone else should share that opinion.  The footnotes and references he introduces are only rarely pertinent and never compelling to the sweeping conclusions he draws.  For example, as support for his premise that global warming and climate change (a claim which is still heatedly debated among scientists and far from being established as fact) will impact the United States' ability to project power, he invokes a single article in the NYT referencing a white house press release that carbon emissions _may_ be a factor.  Wow.  Gosh, I'm convinced.  The book is full of such cases where the author cogently and effectively presents an alternative or scenario which _may_ be true, and then blithely moves on sans proof or support of _why_ it is true to spend the next ten pages describing how that unproven premise will impact the United States and its role in the world.  The author may be correct in his suppositions and conclusions.  But I found I couldn't focus on his points since he left such glaring holes in the chain of reasoning by which he reaches those conclusions.  If you're going to say "If X then Y", you'd better spend some time showing that X is actually the case before you spend pages and pages talking about the impact of Y if you want anyone to care.  "If martians prefer bic lighters to zippos, then clearly the democratic party needs to move more toward the political center" is insufficient justification for then spending 15 pages on talking about why the political center is good for democrats.  A minor peeve of mine was that the author seemed to fall in love with his own clever terminology for things.  For example, he introduces and then gauzily defines the term "soft power" early in the book, and then never misses a chance to refer to how this or that factor might impact a nation's soft power.  To readers who weren't convinced (for the reasons outlined above) in even the _existence_ of soft power, these continuing references are at best annoying and at worst irrelevant 
 This book is the most ridiculous collection of foolishness which I have ever taken the time to read. I am appalled that Mr. Brown did not employ adequate resources to verify many of the allegations made in this book.  For example, I found it totally unacceptable that Mr. Brown alleged that three past U.S. Presidents were Freemasons, when they definitely are not.  Although this is quite an easy area in which to find proof, Mr. Brown calls Presidents Clinton, Carter and Reagan Freemasons, when none of them were so affiliated. I am persuaded to believe that he knew of these falsehoods when he wrote them, because whenever he mentions anyone who actually is a Mason, he is careful to mention which Masonic Lodge they were a part of ... not so with Clinton, Carter or Reagan, because NONE OF THEM WERE MASONS!  He also spent much of his time criticizing the Freemasons, which is obviously an organization that he doesn't understand. More specifically he miss-understands the fact that each Masonic lodge is independent and beholden only to it's own Grand Lodge, such that there would not be much if any cooperation or communication between the various Grand Lodges to the effect that you could get all Freemasons to "conspire" in any complicated effort.  He has obviously taken every negative rumor against Masonry to heart, and synthesized them into this book ... even though the book is not actually "about" Masonry.  It appears to me that Brown's real problem with Masonry is that it is not a "Christian" organization, which they don't purport to be, even though the majority of Masons are Christians.  The book is also garbage where he actual writing is concerned.  The number of times Mr. Brown uses the phrase "illuminati ruling class conspiracy," is sickening, and he makes up words like agentur(s), which he uses synonymously with the word "agent." Every person of any stature is an "agentur of the illuminati ruling class conspiracy" to Mr. Brown. This is the first book I have read which I have disliked to such a degree to write a bad review, and I would dissuade any person from reading this book who does not already have a basis in the reality of the subjects of which Mr. Brown speaks, or else knows when to go to Google or Wikipedia to double check the numerous false allegations or look up the words that this guy has created.  I was thoroughly disappointed, don't waste your time, this is one for the trash heap! 
 I saw this movie with my wife two days ago. I am not a "chick flick" lover but I have seen a few chick flicks that I really enjoyed. Not this one. I have to admit that I suffered, and as it turned out, even my wife hated it. In addition, the auditorium was 2/3 full and still I only heard a few chuckles (the movie was supposed to be funny).  The movie is about an upper class single mom and her girls. The mother, who is an over protective snob, and a pain in the rear end, is hard to believe as a character. The family is very liberal and sexually open minded. This combined with their upper class manners makes the characters difficult to relate to. The funny thing is that I don't think the family was supposed to be upper class (judging from what they were doing for a living).  There are some cruel and unfunny jokes involving a mental therapy patient of Maggie (who is a therapist). I saw Borat, but the tasteless retardation jokes in Borat are obvious satire. The jokes involving the patient in "what about Bob" are funny, but not cruel. In this movie the "mental patient jokes" were humorless and just bad taste. Also Asians are portrayed in an insulting and "not funny" stereotypical way.  The architect/engineer/analytical guy turns out to be the jerk, while the guitar playing musician turns out to be the good guy. How boringly Hollywoodish stereotypical is that?  In summary, the movie was supposed to be a comedy about relationships, but I was bored, and it was difficult to relate to the characters. In addition the movie was annoying. Heed my warning, don't waste your time! 
 There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't 
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 To be honest, I borrowed this book from a public library because the bad experience from its precedessor The Innergame of Trading had deterred me from wasting my hard earned money on this.   For detailed review please see my review of the Innergame of Trading because the two books are so similar, of very low value and repeating the same basic trading psychology stuff like a successful trader got to have discipline, focus, bravery to cut loss short and let profit ride blah blah blah, except that the interview part in Outer is about 100 page longer than that in Inner. (160 vs 60) However, the quality of the interview content is even lower.   I really cannot agree what the authors claimed on the book cover that their book helped the readers to model the trading strategies of Today's Market Wizards. How? Just by going through the lines of the interview. I am afraid that's more diffcult than achieving a 6 month winning streak 
 "Everything is an echo," Ilan Stavans wrote in the essay Lost in Translation. "To live is to plagiarize, to imitate, to steal." And so he does. The editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well-known authors under the common title 'the essential...' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry, whose work can be somehow distilled, but Ilan Stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential' Stavans, only the 'echo.' I always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal Stavans has been against Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros (see 'Form over Content', p. 41). Stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by Chicana writers to create their own respective worlds. The reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book. Stavans' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him--Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Lionel Trilling--writers Stavans has invoked to 'explore' his own identity as a Latino-Jewish male. By his own admission, Stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity, rather than in the assertion of a self-created identity. This is why he writes so brutally against Chicana writers: because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations, they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it. The short stories in this book, particularly, show Stavans at his most derivative, imitating Kafka while alluding to him 
 This (text)book is difficult to understand -not just because of many typos and grammatical errors. The content summarises the concepts introduced in Goldratts novels. Half the book looks like a reprint of The Goal -and yet Goldratt recommends on more than one occasions to re-read the novel.... I enjoyed the novels, but this book looks more like a marketing gag for Goldratts seminars or the journal he writes, publishes and sells 
 We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it.  In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it.  Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.  Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.  We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.  It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.  So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now 
 The book did hold my interest most of the way through; it definitely was a fast-moving story.  I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the setting and the characters.  It started out to be a pretty good mystery, but didn't deliver in the end, and here's where I differ from previous reviewers.  The blurbs describe the book as full of plot twists and surprise endings.  I didn't find this to be true.  I figured out fairly early on what Bridger was up to, and it didn't take a genius to guess who his secret accomplice was.  So much for surprise endings.  In addition, I found the dialogue to be clunky and awkward at times; AND, I wonder, does anyone proof the book drafts before they go to print?  Does the author get to see a proof of his book cover synopsis?  I wonder because on the back of this book it says, "When an explosion kills the NIGHT WATCHMAN at wealthy industrialist Karl Lindstrom's nearby lumber mill..."  As anyone who has actually read this book knows, it was NOT the night watchman who was killed, but another individual.  Just another example of shoddy editing.. 
 This book is written from the point of view of someone who doesn't like cats. It's amusing but not laugh-out-loud funny 
 This books mixes the kind of gardening advice you could get from the most superficial coffee-table gardening book, with singsong rhymes the likes of which are found in mainstream greeting cards. Is the author sincere about her status as high priestess, or is she laughing all the way to the bank?  We may never know, but if you like bad writing you will get some utility from the book.  My favorite part was where she advises putting a small statue of the Goddess into your Goddess garden, because it makes "an excellent Goddess symbol".  (Used copy for sale! 
 Paris Can't sing. Whoever gave her a record deal needs a good reality check. Paris Hilton singing is like R. Kelly getting away with intercoursing that 14 year old girl. It ain't right 
 Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.  First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it.  Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs.  Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face!  There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can 
              ......and that was my review, thank you very much 
 Why? ...Words, Lover's Prayer, To Love Somebody...why? I was pleased to hear Juliet again but resinging Barry's leads is a mistake. Would have loved to hear the brothers together doing a tribute album to Mo instead. When I look at this album, all I can say is "Why? 
 I am an avid reader and a lover of books.  I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn.  I couldn't even finish this book.  It was HORRIBLE!  I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student.  Don't even bother with this book.  You'll be disappointed 
 This is a made for TV movie and not the original film. Do not waste your money on this re-make. Buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred Robert Blake 
 when my friend read all of jane austen a few years ago and just couldn't stop raving, i thought it was time to give the old girl a test ride around the block and see what all the fuss was about. on first try i fell right off. it was like reading a foreign language. my mind wouldn't stand still long enough to learn it. now, though, with the continued push to read jane austen ever before me (the new book, "the jane austen book club" peeked my interest), i thought i'd strap on my helmut and give her one more try. a few years of meditation under my belt would surely slow me down and give me more of a chance to "get it", i thought.  she's still out of reach. i was initially teased, even laughed once or twice as i started "sense and sensibility" but then....it's just soooo boring. austen's portrayal of elinor and marianne and the crew are about as shallow as it gets. there is no depth here in these characters.  my mother even joined me in this reading  endeavor. we started a book club of two, just to accomplish this task... strength in numbers and all that. but, alas, we were both so " monstrous" bored. it was a "sedulous" task at best. we have now named our book club the "anything BUT jane austen book club".  the reasons for the boredom: 1)i'm just not entranced by long, long, long sentences. proust gave it a go and did a much better job. 2)i'm also put off by the confusing use  and over use of pronouns..who really is "he" and "she" and "they"...i think if i'd have submitted this work in college, it would have come back with many margin notes  on grammar, syntax and style. 3)i think i got the idea of the social structure and nuances(where there any?) in the first 50 pages.. the rest was just" monstrous insipid ". 4)and for the storyline.. when austen lovers run out of austen material do they go on to harlequin romances? seems it would be a  logical move.  no more austen for this old girl. life's just too short and there are too many really good books out there 
 Certainly a nice looking book.  From what I understand, Marvels launched the careers of its two principle creators, and it's definitely not a bad place to start.  Alex Ross's work is nothing short of spectacular.  His art is the closest comics will ever come to fine art, and demands respect.  However, I cannot give this book a glowing review because it failed on a very base level.  It failed to pull me into the Marvel Universe.  Sounds odd, I know.  But as a man in my early twenties with little to no understanding (or appreciation) of the Marvel Universe, I'm left in the dark.  I could easily understand why an older man, or a Marvel Comic enthusiast, would love this comic, but as a newcomer, I was left behind.  There is a very fine difference between inventing a concept, and perfecting it.  Marvels serves as the prototype for future masterpiece Kingdom Come, which also featured an everyman POV.  Naturally, there's a frustration on my part that comic creators often make allusions or other nostalgic call-backs to the Silver Age of comics.  This is problematic for comic readers who, like myself, have no intimate knowledge of that bygone era.  And from what I've read of it, there's not a lot that impresses me.  Do not buy this book unless you are very much aware of Marvel's content history.  Otherwise, you'll be left scratching your head.  (God only knows what was happening during that Galactus bout. 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 I hope it's live because if it's memorex, it's crap!  that's my latest opinion after using this product.  I have a LiteOn SOHW-802S and it hates Memorex.  I rarely get a decent burn.  More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it.  My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together.  So disappointing!  Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate!  [... 
  I do not like it for the following reasons:  -It touches the subjects and does not go deep into it. -It does not have examples.  -The very few examples in the chapters are not clear. You have to decipher it. -Some of the end of the chapter problems talks about things not covered.  -It is not an easy read. You have to read a paragraph several time to figure it out. -I do not recommend it. -On second thought, I should have given it 1 star but it seems I can not change that.   
 This book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is, how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis, etc.  However, I don't want to live with RA, I want to recover from it. As such, this book offers no help in this regard. It tells me about drugs that I can take and splints that I can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled, but offers me no hope of recovery.  In contrast, the book "Conquering Arthritis" by Barbara Allan, is the well-researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease, to get their life back. And succeeded! I'm well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book. Now that's a book well worth spending your money on 
 The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out.  I prefer the unabridged versions 
 20 names is pathetic. Should be at least 50 or 100 
 Jerry you sound so good singing salsa. Why do you do this to your fans?? I was very disappointed with this CD. There are only 3 salsa tracks. No vale la pena comprarlo 
 I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 Kimmel and Messner are acomplished researchers, yet I find no reason for the "cute" little additions such as average male size charts and sarcastic quizes revolving around the "gay or straight" issues.  We are saturated with sexuality in our day and age, we don't need it from our scholars as well 
 This text is required at my medical school. The text is dense and unapproachable, but that isn't my main complaint-the organization is TERRIBLE. One drug can be covered in multiple different chapters, but none of the chapters really have a great description! For example, B blockers are covered under "Autonomic Drugs", "Anti-Hypertensive Agents", and "Heart Failure Drugs"... just for starters! Anywhere you can use a B blocker, there's a separate discussion. Just give me ONE chapter on B blockers that actually talks about all of their uses! If you do have to use this awful book, be advised that the first section of each chapter is a review of the pertinent physiology. If you need to go over this again to understand how the drugs will act, then use your favorite physio book, not Katzung 
 Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.  Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again 
 For a long awaited, monumental study of the South's road to disunion, you had best keep waiting. This is one tough read. There is good history here but this author is very complicated and has a hard time saying just what is on his mind. Was the story really this complex? Yes, it really was. But is it necessary to make a complex series of events murky and unclear? I don't think so. Freehling is a good historian but this is a far cry from his finest effort 
  This book is awful.  What a disappointment after such great success with Theodore Roosevelt.  I forced myself through half this book straining to distinguish reality from the fiction and fantasy that Morris interjects willy-nilly throughout.  What a chore, what a bore, what a waste.  This went in the trash can rather then the bookshelf to insure no one else might pick it up and waste as much time as I did on it.  
 I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).  The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.  This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.  The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.  The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.  So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.  While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this 
 If you want an outstanding book on spiritual warefare? This is not what you want.  What you want is "Divine Energy: The Orthodox Path to Christian Victory" by Jon E. Braun. As a matter of fact read both books and deside for yourself 
 As an engaged man, I found this book to be lacking in many ways, particularly when compared to LaHaye's "The Act of Marriage" which is, frankly, the gold standard on the topic.  I felt Wheat's book lacked the practical details and substantial insights when compared to LaHaye.  Rather than focusing on the act of sex, Wheat devoted a lot of time to the psycho-social issues surrounding the lack of sexual satisfaction within Christendom vs. the practical things that can be done to increase such satisfaction.  This book is also, at times, clearly focused on non-Christians or those unsure about their personal faith in Christ.  If you're unsure about what God says about sex, marriage, and companionship, this might not be a bad book to read in conjuction with "The Sacred Marriage" -- the other gold standard on marraige.  However, if you're secure in your faith in Christ, this book will come off a somewhat rudimentary and a little preachy. Bottom line: as an enagaged man looking for practical insights secure in his faith/identity in Christ, this book was of little help to me -- hence my lackluster review 
 The Quest was one of the movies that began the descent of Jean-Claude Van Damme from a major motion picture star into a straight-to-video movie star, which still is better than most actors accomplish, but far from the level that Van Damme achieved at the height of his success.  The Quest is a poor ripoff of Bloodsport and Kickboxer about a martial arts tournament with Roger Moore thrown in for comic relief. While there are some good fight scenes, they don't make this film worth watching or buying. Fortunately, Jean-Claude made many more that are worth watching 
 This is completely UNAUTHORIZED by the band, meaning there are no interviews with the band, and no music by the band on the DVD.  Features the same 5 band photos over and over, no live clips, and interviews are okay, none with the band.  If you really want a biography on MCR, get "Life on the Murder Scene".  A little more expensive, but has 2 DVD's and a live CD, tons of music by MCR, and interviews with MCR.  This DVD has audio a couple of recordings of the video interviews on "Life on the Murder Scene".  Trivia was okay.  I would not have bought if I would have known how bad it was 
 On April 26, 2005, this collection was re-released as part of the Universal Music Gold collection, at a much lower price (in Canada, anyway).  The material and mastering are fantastic, worthy of 5 stars, but the price, when compared to Gold, made me give the Anthology just one star 
 Great opinion on this craze.  Could have been summed up in four words: Right place, Right time. The only way money was made here was preying on those people  who have nothing better to do than watch late night infomercials and dream of ways to turn around their pathetic lives.  You should be ashamed of yourselves, trying to make more money because of these people by offering this tripe.  Shame,shame, shame.  I can't wait to see you're next book,  I Can't Believe They Bought It!!!! 
 I bought this hotbrush with the hopes that it would shorten the time it takes to dry my hair straight. Well it does do that but you are left with a frizzy mess if your hair is naturally curly.  The results are like using your hairdryer with a wide toothed comb and you still have to use your flat iron to smooth and straighten it out.  All in all this product is definately not worth the money.  Keep your blow dryer and round brush and save yourself $50 
 This is the most stupid product you can buy. It makes opening doors even easier. Maybe instead of selling this as a "door knob lock", it may be sold to be useful with people with arthritis. This doesn't even deserve one star 
 If you really like J.D. Salinger, please don't read this book. It's just depressing. Frankly I don't doubt the truth of it, but do I really want to know what a nasty self centered oaf he can be? No I don't 
 This book was assigned as a college reading assignment for an American Literature course, so I knew right off that I wasn't in for a real literary treat.  The criteria for a reading assignment are: a main character must suffer and then die, and language and plot must work to confuse the reader.  If you're looking for an entertaining read, do not choose this novel.  If, however, you are looking to read something for the sole purpose of telling others that you have read it, and wish to brag at dinner parties and other things of that nature, this is probably the book for you.  Personally, I like to believe that I have better things to do than read something that is depressing, boring, and poorly written 
 I was excited to see what all the fuss was about after hearing about kettlebells and what an effective training tool they are.  However, after  reading this book it was evident that it is incomplete and poorly conceived, of poor quality and lacking in too many areas to be taken seriously.  (Also, it has since been superceded by "Enter the Kettlebell" in which Pavel contradicts himself.)  I was confused by the many typographical errors with whole paragraphs being repeated out of sequence in non-related chapters and the lack of photographs required to do a good job of conveying how to properly execute the various movements.  This could be quite dangerous for the trainee who doesn't have the time, money or inclination to spend $1500-2000 to take a beginners kettlebell course.  Surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?  I got the distinct impression that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) convince you that you MUST take a "certified" kettlebell course or (2) get you to buy more expensive books or (3)get you to buy expensive DVD's.  "Take down that wall Gorby"...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training "secrets".  As much as the kettlebell "cultists" would like you to believe how great they are, fortunately most of us are not confined to a Russian gulag or currently in exile in Siberia working out with balls of iron with a handle in the sub-freezing cold, performaing boring, mind numbing endless repetitions of snatches and swings.  No, here in America, a long time ago, someone came up with the idea of ADJUSTABLE dumbells and barbells with which you can progressively add weight and thereby grow in strength and muscularity.  Plenty of trainees around the world have built great physiques and strength without ever having touched a kettlebell.  Keep that in mind and try to see past the hype 
 As a great fan of dog stories, I had enjoyed one of this author's tales excerpted in a dog story anthology, and thought that I might relish more of her work.  Was I ever WRONG!!!  Half or less of the book was related to canines, and then often remotely.  Many of her works (this is a compendium of essays) are spoiled by her frequent use of the most vile, crude, and vulgar expletives, always unnecessary and adding nothing to the story.  Although humorous on the rarest of occasions, this tome consists mainly of the mindless babblings of the typically self-loathing liberal.  Unfit even as a chew toy for your pup 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 Don't waste your money on this book. Save it for your equipment. A better choice for a beginner's book is Nightwatch by Terence Dickinson, available from Amazon.com. You should also subscribe to Sky & Telescope magazine and order a free catalog from Orion Telescopes and Binoculars Co. Their Web site URL is telescopes.co 
 I came upon this film while browsing my university library. My curiosity was picqued, since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking (Mardi Gras) and eating (Cajun food).  This film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in Jean Lafitte National Park. Looking out over a marsh (through which runs a large gas pipeline), the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell-Texaco, et al., all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands. If they're cleaning anything, it's their own mess. And what methods are they using? "Bio-restorative detonations," I believe, was the term used. Are those "life-giving bombs"?  Back to the film, funded as propaganda by Standard Oil Co. when local sentiment was turning against the company. I'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled Cajuns smile broadly at the blessed Oil Rig plopped in their marsh, and the way the young boy is given the Disney-nature-film treatment, as amusingly naive as Lobo the Wolf or Henry the Mountain Burro. No, just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state. And then visit the beautiful scenery of Norco, LA, in the middle of the famed Cancer Alley 
 Sonny Barger's tales are Slurs of Confabulations, False Recollections, Fuzzy Logics, basics of "FMS" (False Memory Syndrome). Sonny Barger demonstrates a "Limitless Capacity for Denail" therefore Distorting His Own Statements from Yesteryear. Mr. Barger was evidently under the impression, by placing his name upon a book that the reading public would be sensationalized into the Illusion Barger's some sort of an American Hero, Hardly. Mr. Barger speaks of Brotherhood & Freedom; Never Defining either. (Brotherhood was betrayal of silence after the RICO Trial. Freedom was before Barger's First Conviction, since he has never known real freedom.) All too-much in Barger's Book can be refuted by its mere statements. This book was obviously just put together for money and cover-ups. Publisher should have included an airsickness bag with each book. 10% of a book that covers over 40-years of Hells Angels History was spent taking cheap shots at the Government, over the RICO Trail 1979/1980. This was a Gamble by the Publisher, too-many have known otherwise. Publisher changing the title would help. (Hell's Angel: The Lies and Crimes of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club) 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
 I completely agree with the prior reviewer -- this book was way too silly to be taken seriously.  I've read some of Stuart Woods' earlier work, which was VERY well written and believable.  This book was decently written (I finished it) but had so many ridiculous plot developments that I can't recommend it.  My advice is to skip this book unless you're looking for pure escapism. 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 Before I say what I am sad to say, I love John Digweed. There's this thing he does with crowds that no other dj I know of, does.  He has this way of manipulating you into a progressive oceanic state, but with unexpected and insanely welcome punches!!  One moment you're traveling fast and steady, thinking he could wind everyone down (and that would be ok), but right then he hits you hard over the head with crashing energy that sends you to the moon and back... you know you're back on the ground when you hear the whole place cheering.  This CD set is not that.  There are one or two places that make your head bob, but overall it lacks energy.  It's also creepy, dark, and depressing.  I've tried listening to it several times, hoping it was just my mood, but each time I ended up feeling like I had PMS.  This is definitely not one of my favorites 
 I installed this cover and took pictures from various distance and angel. I could read all numbers clearly.  They claim that it will work with actual traffic camera. I have no way to test that 
 This book is out-dated and contains a lot of mis information.  This book tends to blame parents for OCD and does not begin to mention the chemical imbalance that is now known to be a cause of OCD 
 This book was a silly mess.  Karp's pop ethnopediatric approach, which likens toddler development to the evolutionary development of humans, was silly at best and scientifically shoddy at worst.  In addition to the problems with his guiding analogy, his notion of "speaking toddlerese" and thus supposedly showing our young children that we understand their feelings is ridiculous.  Maybe it's just my kid, but I don't think many young children are that in touch with the feelings which we are supposed to mirror back to them.  In addition, my child doesn't care if I understand her or not if (as another reviewer remarked) the answer is still no.  I think understanding child development is very important in helping parents to contextualize and deal with various behaviors, but this book is a failure in both of these respects.  
 While Edgar winner Walters' psychological thrillers (in the Ruth Rendell vein) are among my favorites, this is her weakest effort to date.  British war correspondent Connie Burns recognizes a sadistic mercenary while on assignment in Iraq. She had met the man while in Sierra Leone two years earlier and, based on his reputation for brutality towards the native prostitutes, suspected him of the vicious murders of five women.  Though nothing came of her suspicions, she immediately resumes her digging when she spots him in Iraq under a different name. His employers stonewall her investigation and shortly thereafter she is abducted, then released after three days. Though she refuses to discuss her ordeal we know who grabbed her and as the book proceeds nothing about her horrible experience comes as a surprise.  Traumatized, she holes up in an old house in Dorset (where Walters lives), suffers panic attacks and edgily befriends a taciturn local woman who as a teenager lost her family in a car crash.  The predictable stalking by the kidnapper overshadows the subplot concerning this woman and the elderly owner of the Dorset house, while the protracted ending is first, not credible, and second, way too talky. A major disappointment.  -- Portsmouth Heral 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 I can't figure out what is so special about this rice cooker so I am irritated by the price which is making me wonder if their whole product line is over priced  
 I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time 
 Very much a disappointment! Especially for those of you who were deticated fans to the Talking Heads throughout the late 70's and 80's. The first three tracks were okay, I guess or better yey I should say TOLERABLE. Tracks 4 through 10 on the other hand ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Like fingernails on a black board and it's sad because those of you who could dance to classic hits such as "burning down the house" that listened to this album know there's nothing you can dance to, or really even upbeat for that matter. It was an unfortunately exhausted effort by who even by 1988 was a worn out band. Why do you think later by the following year maybe 1990 they broke up 
 A bit cheesey... I felt like I was reading a fluffed up self-help book! If you are a fan of The Da Vinci Code looking for more information on the lost sacred feminine, this book will be of little help.  I bought it because I thought it would be an interesting way to absorb some facts, but I found it to be a simplistic, repetetive, overly-idealized account of a woman's "rebirth".  I couldn't even finish it!  While its okay as a light read, it won't satisfy your want of solid religious/historical information 
 The title sounds perfect for me, but I found this book very frustrating. Much of it is paraphrased man pages, and there are very few actual examples. This is frustrating when you have to really study, say, the  regular expression syntax, when a simple example would do wonders instead.  I do use this book occassionally for quick reference, but otherwise look  elsewhere 
 If it were not for the many sexual innuendos in these movies, I would have rated them maybe a 3 because I do enjoy some satire.  But I wanted to draw attention that these movies have similar adult humor as in the Simpsons cartoon and Saturday Nite Live....so buyer beware.  These movies are not rated professionally but the content should be described on Amazon as to what may be offensive to some.  I bought this collection because of 2 reviews on Amazon that said these were clean and innocent enough for kids. Although one did say in the title that not all the Thumb movies were OK for children.  I didn't see that person's headline or 1 star..only that they put in their review "innocent enough for children".  I goofed and listened to those reviews.  I wish I hadn't.  If only I could have rented it first but I couldn't find it to rent.  Our kids love the Star Wars movies so I thought Thumb Wars and the other thumb movies would be funny to watch together as a family.  Sure they're somewhat funny but I wasn't laughing hysterically and we "all" were caught off guard by the sexual innuendos.  I'm only going to list their real characters because I forgot their humorous thumb names.  Case in point:  1 scene has the Obiwan and Luke thumb characters getting down on the floor and looking up the dress of the hologram of Princess Leah.  Another scene has Obiwan telling Luke to make sure he doesn't have any girl clothes on underneath his own clothes?  Oh yeah...then there's the scene when Obiwan wants to seal a deal with Luke and asks that they touch their tongues together (which doesn't actually happen, thank God)....and another, where R2D2 and C3PO are getting intimate with each other before someone interrupts them when entering the room.  I'm sure there was more.  We didn't even finish watching that movie.  Our 15 year old had enough sense to walk out of the room. If this is the kind of humor that you want your kids to see, I'm sure you'll love it.  As for me, I'm going to try and return the collection or throw it out.  Think twice before wasting your hard earned money on them!     
 I was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists. I avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes. We have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an I refuse to add to the this insanity. However, to my great disappointment, the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge. Then the light ceases to function at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times, yet the same problem persisted. I checked with BELL too to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and I wasn't. This light is a great idea, albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by Bell. The two stars are for the great idea 
 considering that sex should be about as interesting a topic as there is, it really is amazing how so many writers can make it sooooo dull. are orgies really about as interesting as roofing a house? reading this author, it sure seems like it. what a disappointment this book was. not once did i achieve wood status while reading it. horrible. horrible. horrible. about as bad a book as i've ever read 
 This may be a perfectly good phone, and I've had great success with other Uniden products.  But Amazon's specifications for this product describe it as "headset compatible".  This phone has no headset jack, and is most definitely  NOT headset compatible. Since I require a headset, you can imagine how happy I am with this product 
 This is very strange stuff considering that this should have been a self-serving vehicle for Moose, but time and again he portrays himself in the worst possible light. He describes himself as being impossibly oversensitive to handle the stress of his job or even daily life, with a history of hysterical screaming public outbursts over the slightest frustration. Plus, he seems endlessly disillusioned, bitter, and strangley surprised about how routine functions of local government don't live up to his idealized visions. Not someone I'd want to work for or even be around 
 Maybe I am even less talented than I thought, maybe I am just downright stupid, maybe problem is in my expectations, as I expected something more visual and less technical.. but this book is not a beginner's book. I bought a telescope for my son this xmas, and I wanted to know what the heck we are looking at once skies clear over Croatia. This book will not serve that purpose. IF I WERE an astronomy / physics anthusiast (NEVER!), THEN this book would have been a beginner's book 
 For someone with apparent credentials to write about the life of Jesus, Borg shows an amazing ineptitude. He claims "What was his [Jesus] message? Most centrally, it was about himself: his own identity as the Son of God, the saving purpose of his death, and the importance of believing in him. (p. 2)" EXCUSE ME. What Gospel has he been reading? The Gospel According to Paul, I think, which is no gospel at all. The perversion of the message of Jesus with the message of Paul is one of the great crimes on the past 2000 years, and Borg's own Christian background appears to have influenced his thinking here. Jesus' message, if I have to remind him, was about love for each other and for ourselves. Yes, and he had some stuff to say about loving God and following the law.   As if misunderstanding Jesus was not a sufficient cause to never read this book, Borg spends far too much time talking about himself. Quite frankly, I don't care.  I'm also highly suspicious of anyone who talks about the "Jesus of Nazareth" without brackets, because it has become apparent to anyone who studied archeology, Josephus, the Old Testament, the Talmud, and virtually any other piece of contemporaneous Christian literature that the town of Nazareth didn't exist until after Jesus' death. Any scholar who still speaks about Jesus of Nazareth (instead of Jesus the Nazorene, which is the proper translation) is no scholar at all 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book "The Great Divorce" 
 I was really excited to find a book merging Six Sigma and Software Development, but after reading the book, I still have no idea "how" I would implement the methodology.  Tayntor clearly understands the Six Sigma theory and practice, but fails to convice me of its relevance to system development life cycle (SDLC) models.   In the book, we learn the Six Sigma methodology, consisting of the steps "Define - Measure - Analyze - Improve - Control," works well for certain business models. The main goal of Six Sigma is to satisfy the "voice of the customer" or VOC. The VOC describes the needs or requirements of the customer.  To ensure that outputs meet the customers' requirements, you must identify, quantify, and control the critical process inputs called X's. This control over the Xs reduces variation in the outcomes (or Y's).   For software developers, using Six Sigma to fully understand the Voice of Customer (VOC), means substantial savings and better overall product quality.  Most costs overruns in software development are the result of poorly defined requirements. With Six Sigma and SDLC, the problem is implementation. We are not counting widgets, but discussing abstract intellectual processes. This a hard thing to quantify. I can count errors and I can reduce errors, but is bug free code necessarily good code?   Jeannine Siviy said it best when she described Six Sigma methods in manufacturing as "mature", but applications in software development are still "emerging".  If you are really trying to implement Six Sigma, I would recommend, Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit for Software Development Managers  by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck. 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 I own a Infiniti G35. This product makes a lot of noise and the skip feature did not work in the G35 
 I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow. 
 About the only thing this album is worth is the inclusion of the original mixes of Boyz N Tha Hood and Dope Man. They aren't that drastically different than the versions that appeared on Eazy-Duz-It and Straight Outta Compton. There is also the lame clean version of 8-Ball (NOT the original song, but a clean, radio version, which is only interesting in that it was on the D.O.C's "It's Funky Enough". This hodge-podge was thrown together by Macola more-or-less to make some money off of NWA, whose future at that point was up in the air because Ice Cube was off at college. The songs came from the "Boyz" 12", the "Panic Zone" 12" and were rounded out by D.O.C.'s Fila Fresh Crew and the song "Scream" by Rappinstine, which was later replaced by "A Bitch Iz A Bitch" when Ruthless got the rights back to this album in 1989. (That song was originally on the Express Yourself 12" and is now a bonus track on "Straight Outta Compton" as well).  This is interesting more or less for historical purposes, but there's nothing on really that's all that important. Aside from the original mixes of "Boyz" and "Dope Man", this is for die-hards only. The rest is 2nd rate typical early/mid 80's generic rap, which gives no indication of what would follow. 
 Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission.  It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing.  At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been.  The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned.  However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here.  The book simply fails to deliver.  If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one 
 What really cracks me up about this junk is that you retards are losing.  Even Newt freaking Gingrich admits global warming is real.  Sanity is slowly but surely prevailing, praise Jesus 
 Kind of a snoozer, despite at times reading like a pep rally.  Wait till the price goes down 
 We are HUGE Amazon customers and we have always been so pleased with our purchases.  However we were shocked when we went to use 4 out of 6  of these expensive wine glasses.  THEY FELL APART!  The glass is tissue thin!  Perhaps from shipping there are many fine fractures????  One fell apart in my guest's hand...three fell apart later that night while being rinsed out.  we handled these glasses so delicatly...I have 2 more and we would like to send them back and be reimbursed for all 6. 
 This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work.  I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out.  I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on.  Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books.  And he sounds like a real prima donna.  
 I disliked the violence Jacques occasionally displayed towards Shea, with his 'insanity' serving as an excuse.  Particularly in the scenes at the beginning of the book, such as where Jacques meets his brother again, the abuse was too much to ever allow Jacques to be a likeable, or even tolerable, character.  This was my least favourite of all her Dark series books 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 Though this seems to be an extensively researched book on a thoroughly fascinating subject, the author's language is so awkward, inconsistent in tone and fraught with error that Vanilla is frustrating to read.    Ironically, the author Patricia Rain states in her acknowledgements that her editors' English "is impeccable."  I find it hard to believe that the text was even proofread.    Consider the following sentence, typical of the language in the book:   "Families pollinate with the stem off a leaf of the tutor tree, toothpicks, twigs, or long thumbnails."     It requires multiple passes from the reader before one realizes that there is a spelling error.  I consistently find myself deciding if I want to decipher what Rain is trying to say and continue with the abundant information she has gathered, or to give up and wait for another, better edition.    
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox!

 Not in all my life have I had so much trouble getting through a book.  A mere 226 pages, it took me over a week to read.  Kraut's seems to feel the need to use words many well educated people have never seen in their lives just for the sake of using big words.  Whenever he speaks of his other books, he refers to himself in the third person and quotes himself rather than just stating the facts.  An uninteresting and egotistical story of immigrantion 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I do believe that many books on entrepreneurship are meant to be inspirational and therefore end up being unrealistic, and to be fair, I do think this book paints a more practical and accurate picture.  With that said, the book was very general, lacked interesting and relevant examples, and didn't add much value.  Furthermore, the book seems to be 200 pages but about 70 pages are a worthless list of universities.  The worst thing?  The authors repeatedly present italicized quotes of themselves, attempting to make their own thoughts and backgrounds seem even more important than they are.  Disappointing 
 There are some good things as well as some bad things about Micro Fiction. The good thing about this book is that it has variation in the texture and tone of the stories. My favorite would have to be Morning News which was written by the author himself.   Also the author has managed to touch on many different subject matters. However the bad news is that many of the stories in the book are not very well written, some of it is formula fiction and I had trouble understanding the meaning behind a couple of them. The upside is that the book costs less than $2 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book. I found it to be overtly racist. I had bought it to share with my grade 3/4 classroom as we are studying Ancient Egypt. I like to stretch the curriculum with literature, art, and more. Unfortunately, I did not read the book carefully before I bought it. When I did, I noticed immediately that the 'cinderella' heroine of the story had golden hair and fair skin while the evil, lazy, etc step-sisters had dark hair & skin. This was explicitly written and illustrated. This is a shame and so unnecessary. Obviously, Egypt is in northern Africa and while some tales of Cleopatra suggest that she may have been fair due to the Ptolemy's Greek lineage, I would suggest that most inhabitants of ancient egypt were of african, mediterranean, semitic, or arabic descent and dark-hued. I strongly recommend that you NOT buy this book 
 You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that. 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull 
 The songs on this album are very good. Which features a range of eclectic songs that suit deborah harrys vocals, ranging from smooth voiced to more pop/rock songs ,in particular I like the song in 'love with love'ecspecially the layered vocal talents. A really good album 
 I just ordered the world of little people sweet sounds from amazon. I haven't received it yet. I paid $200.00 for it. Now I can see it's selling for $139.00. I've also seen it for $32.00. What's going on. Is there a difference in sets? I'm not sure, but I think I acted too quickly. Can anyone tell me if there is a difference in the doll houses? Did I make a big mistake 
 I just couldn't sit there anymore....the movie was painfully boring, the storyline totally rediculous....the stuff they put in to shock us was amusing...and not in a good way. This movie didn't need to be made. 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 These dudes are just plain awful. Only in the mediocrity of country music can they survive and make the charts. Some of the worst vocals that you will EVER here. Ronnie Dunn is one of the worst singers ever.  Nothing here as aweful as My Maria, but pretty bad stuff. The more my niece plays this crapola around me the sicker I ge 
 There is no doubt that Elizabeth George is a marvelous writer. I have previously read and own all of her novels. Prequels can be interesting reads in many cases, but this isn't one of them. Writing in dialect is a dangerous chance a writer takes because it makes for a difficult, often boring read. This novel is 548 pages of tedious dialect representative of a lower class that is well done enough to draw us into the sad story and begin to understand how they speak. I'm sorry but it is much more than I want to know. As a mystery buff, I read for enjoyment and the suspense of the story--NOT in order to raise my social consciousness. This novel is NOT a good choice for a fan of George's work. I wish I hadn't bought it 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD! The other songs just don't appeal to me. He is a good singer though 
 This media did not work on my brand new asus burner, even after updating the firmware 
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
 What is this book about? Whale revenge? What is that? I read the whole book and all they do is ride around in a boat. And there's a whale. And they kill it. This is basically Moby Dick for kids. I'm guessing the whale is the main character as none of the characters are memorable. I don't fault the author, but what editor allowed this book to sneak by? I guess somebody who likes whales a real lot 
 I am not going to comment on the compilation, it is OK. The sound quality however is terrible. The supposedly rerecorded bass on the older tracks is quite weak, most of the recordings sound horrible, with a lot of distortions, elevated highs, clipping, suppressed midrange and muddy bass; "Paranoid" sounds like it was recorded with a microphone hidden in somebody's purse. I have quite a few CDs with hard-rock and metal recorded in the 70s, and they all sound better. This CD is a pain to listen to 
 I had to use this book for my database management class at Sac State. Only one word can describe this book: horrid. This is the first time I was afraid of failing a class and I beleive that this book had a lot to do with it. It was too difficult to follow and I found myself frustrated and sleepy at the same time. There is just too much information and the examples are not helpful at all. For our final project we had to create SQL statements to query the tables in our Oracle database and during the 12 hours I spent yesterday trying to finish not once was this text helpful. I tried to sell it back too, but apparently no one wants it. Just as well I guess since I might need it again next semester (assuming I don't pass that is). : 
 Too long. Too much smoking and drinking. Too much bizarre sex.  A disappointment, because it could have been much better 
 This book provided very little factual infoprmation.  It seems that the author just wanted a medium to express her personal spiritual views.  If you are trying to research locks, it would be best to seek out another source 
 I checked this out because I wanted to take a look at what the new Doctor Who people have been doing in the recent past.  The Second Coming isn't quite as cosmic, but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy. Steve Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) has an epiphany one night when he's out on the town with some mates. He reckons he's become the Son of God and he proceeds to turn night into day at Maine Road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely-chosen status (a bit like David Icke, except with powers). His immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the `new disciples' some of them - notably Judith his girlfriend (Lesley Sharp) - remain sceptical. Through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a `Third Testament'. It later transpires that if they do not, the end of the world will soon follow.  What are this messiah's credentials? Well, he spends forty days in the wilderness which is Saddleworth Moor and he has no earthly father - it turns out that his dad is infertile and couldn't have fathered him. This tickled me. Did writer Russell T. Davis pass his GCSE in Religious Studies, do we think? I couldn't really work out whether the religious symbolism was unconsciously corny and nave or whether it aimed at giving us a laugh. I'd like to think the latter. Steve, curiously, isn't what we might describe as spiritual - certainly not religious. He swears all the time, boozes and although not quite loutish, is somewhat laddish. He's a laddish messiah. His disciples swear at him and he insults them back. (Message to southerners - we in the north are not all like this, despite the plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise: Preston Front, Our Friends in the North, etc. Writers do seem to have this desire to patronise us thus.)  What's noticeable about the founders of the major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree of religious wisdom. Steve, who just witters nonsensically to the crowds, seems to lack this facility. Is he meant to be devoid of wisdom? Are we asking too much of Russell T. Davis to place some in his mouth? Could he have done so had he wished? Presumably our writer would need to possess some himself! (Jury's out.) It turns out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme's message.  So what happens? Despite almost two hours of waiting for Judgement Day, with little action or plot development we eventually come to learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib. He ends up at the girlfriend's home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or epitome of human religiosity. Enlightened humanity - Judith - finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him and she spits him out. They argue for a while before atheism wins out and Steve chomps down the poisoned pasta (after the two hours I found myself saying `bon appetit'). So we get the sermon, although it's a secular one which declares the futility of religious belief. But this messiah seemed to me to be almost devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway. You can't debunk what doesn't exist. Steve can't be a foil for atheism if he IS a kind of atheism. I suppose that we do end up questioning Russell T Davis's understanding of spirituality, not to say he should necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality, but perhaps to understand it to come degree. And yes, there is a naivety and a corniness which underpins all this third-form philosophy, typical of so many young people working within the arts.   It's a pity that the message of the piece couldn't have been delivered within the actual context of the drama itself. What we have is a two hour TV play followed by a secular sermon, subtext puked out and all. We do have an epilogue, however, where our new-found heroine is hilariously transfigured at the supermarket. I do recommend The Second Coming for amusement, but for enlightenment you'd better have something else to hand. 
 too expensive, too little heat, unit quit after a year of intermittent use - I won't buy Vornado again. 
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor.  The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect.  In other places, the supporting music is  barely audible.  The only singing occurs on track 12.  I would recommend  getting the cd "Picture This".  It's much better 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 In recent years, Routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.   The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!   In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan. 
 Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research 
 I agree that at 78 pages it's a fast simple read, Although, I have a hard time with the fact that If you tell anyone you are a Shaman you will lose your power. I also had a hard time with Journeying to ask life questions such as; How should I handle a certian situation, What should I do....or better yet, have someone else Journey for you to ask these questions.  I don't get it.  If you need this much help to live YOUR life...then why bother. I get the fact of Journeying for enlightenment, but I think the Author needs more help than just journeying.  I'm looking to enlighten my life/spirit not journey so my power animal/teacher can tell me how to live my life. I think the best part of this book was the free drumming cd 
 I would possibly recommend this book for children but not for the serious reader or someone who needs information pertaining to African-American scientists and inventors. The book has a very elementary style of writing and few citations of where the information was obtained. I was expecting a book with deep information of African-American history but was disappointed in the juvenile nature of the book 
 This book is really a rehash of Ivins' columns that make her a rich liberal living in Austin. Her selective accounts of Texas politics, her ignoring the facts about the Enron scandal happening on Clinton's watch, her changing of history when it comes to Texas environmental issues, education issues, and other topics makes this a work of fiction. This is not a book about "George W. Bush's America" as its title claims. It is about Ms. Ivins distorted view about the record of G. W. Bush. There are far too many factual errors, and outright misrepresentations to list them. But one example is the education issue. Numerous studies have shown that the "No child left behind" act has resulted in dramatic improvement in test scores for underprivileged children where school systems have had to change focus on education instead of the school lobby. Ms Ivins' references to this change refer only to discredited "studies" by special interest organizations whose methodology has been discredited.  This is a very mendacious book. The good part of this book is that it is one of those reinforcement exercises for delusional liberals. They will read this, support Howard Dean, and lose the next election. Molly is a gift that keeps on giving. 
 Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly.  5 days after emailing the company, they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box.  Very frustrating- I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it. Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart 
 I read this book with my bookclub.  It sounded witty and fun.  It was not.  It was very boring and a big let down.  Most of the stories went like this:  we found a dead body, this is what we did, then we went home.  My bookclub has been meeting many years.  This book was voted the worst book we have read as a group.  I would give it no stars if I could.  Don't waste your money 
 this james patterson book sucked horribly! my stupid friend read it and thought it was good, but it wasn't.  its a about some angry Jews who will stop at nothing for revenge.... not exactly a good story. ugh i can't beleive she read this horrible peice of trash, jenny, i feel sorry for yo 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves.  Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market.  Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco.  There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides 
 This is a terrible missues of one of Asimovs greatest novels. The relevance to the novel is only marginal.   Will Smith is (as usual) doing a terrible job at being an action hero. He should have stayed with the sit-coms 
 The best part of my DVD is the FBI warning at the beginning and the theme song.  I am 4 episodes into to the first dvd and I have not laughed even once.  The humor is not clever.  It is Chris Elliot falling down and hurting himself over and over again, or exposing himself to radiation, and then someone cranks up the laugh track. I liked Chris okay on David Letterman; he wasn't the main attraction, but his skits there were okay, and I appreciated them.  Unfortunately, so far in this first season, this series sucks.  It isn't funny; it isn't clever.  The idea behind the series, a loser who still lives with his parents and has a paper route has promise.  The execution is pathetic.    Let me give you an example of one of the most clever things on the show.  Chris falls in love with a gal in the 4th episode and he confides in Gus that everywhere he looks, he sees this girl's face.  Gus points out that he has pictures of her put up all over his room.  And the camera shows lots of pictures of this girl all over his wall.  Big laughs from the "audience."  Now, if that sounds funny to you and put a smile on your face, you will love this series.  Later on, this gal throws a rock from her window and hits Chris in the head.  Again, the laugh track is cranked up.  For me, I don't know if I will watch past this 4th episode.   There are many good reviews here, which are an absolute mystery to me.  Maybe the key is, if "Married With Children" is your idea of high comedy, then "Get a Life" maybe right down your alley.   Notice on several reviews, people recall how great this series was when they were 11 or 13; but when they see it again, they are suprised as to how bad it is now.  Maybe this would appeal to your 12 year old kid; and maybe if your intellect level is that of a 12 year old, this could be the show for you.  "Friends," which is not my idea of a great show by the way, is probably too subtle for you. 
 Had high hopes for the book, but in the end it gave the same old strawmen that other egalitarian books give. The chapter on Equal in Being, Unequal in Role confuses ontology with a variant expression of ontology via gender. So the spin goes on and on. If only there was a good argument in support of egalitarian views of Scripture, but in the end it's pretty much just a movement that doesn't want to believe the Bible would be so "restricting" when their view of salvation, which has a flare of liberation theology within their redemptive grid, liberates everyone from any sort of submissive role. The book really should be entitled: Discovering Theological Equality: How to Have Submission without Authority. It's just that ridiculous 
 It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.  It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.  Most of the "women" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was "such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.    Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.    There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.  If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.  Gettysburg is much better.  I actually missed Sheen and I hate that guy 
 Huber's argument does not take into account the interconnectedness of nature. To him, if humans cannot see a problem with thier own eyes, it does not exist. This line of thinking is curiously primitive. The perceptive powers of human beings were formed during the evolution of our species, in which survival did not entail managing the Earth's enviromental woes. Survival only entailed the management of enviromental problems in our immediate vacinity. Thus our evolved "astetic" sense of problems in our enviroment is limited to those problems which posed dangers to our species as we evolved. According to Huber only problems sensed by this primitive awareness can be considered real "hard" challenges to the enviroment. All other challenges to the enviroment, sensed by different means (for instance satilite data, computer models, scientific studies) must be classified as "soft" challenges, because they are imperceptable to our evolved senses. This is absolute hogwash!! Humans evolved to live primitive lives on the plains of Africa. Now that we have formed advanced civillizations there are bound to be concepts and problems that we can percieve only through the use of science, computers, or machines, and not with our eyes and ears. Just because mining is underground is imperceptable to humans dosen't mean it cannot have delterious effects upon the ecosystem we depend upon. Just because we cannot see, smell, taste, or hear carbon monoxide pollution dosen't mean its not deadly. This book, at its heart, is a screed against reason that no enviromentalist should take seriously. The author has no training in the enviromental sciences, and is financed by a right-wing think tank. His ideas are only provocative because they go against the grain, not because they make any sense. It's kinda like saying the holocaust never happened. You get attention, but no respect. This man and his screed against reason should recieve niether 
 Unless you know absolutely nothing about Italy this book isn't that helpful.  It says at nauseum that the Italians are loyal to their friends and family.  The assumption is that if you are from an English speaking country you aren't.  It is also biased against southern Italy.  It assumes that the people buying the book are only going to Milan, and are married men with kids.  I think for the money you can buy another book that is more thorough.  It only took me two hours to read this book, and for what I got out of it it wasn't worth it.  This book was written by a British author, I recommend buying a book by an American author if you are American because the British and American cultures are not identical.  
 If you're looking for a book to teach the basics of trading options and futures, this one might do you. Of course, for that purpose, it's about $50 overpriced. If you're wanting to learn more about the fundamentals of evaluating energy markets, this book really has absolutely nothing to say. Don't be fooled by the title 
 Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed 
 Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned 
 I am very pleased with this purchase.  The photos are so wonderful and makes one feel so relaxed and into the Christmas spirit.  Have already tried a couple of the recipes and the family thoroughly enjoyed them. Thanks to Southern Living for another wonderful Christmas Book 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 This text is required at my medical school. The text is dense and unapproachable, but that isn't my main complaint-the organization is TERRIBLE. One drug can be covered in multiple different chapters, but none of the chapters really have a great description! For example, B blockers are covered under "Autonomic Drugs", "Anti-Hypertensive Agents", and "Heart Failure Drugs"... just for starters! Anywhere you can use a B blocker, there's a separate discussion. Just give me ONE chapter on B blockers that actually talks about all of their uses! If you do have to use this awful book, be advised that the first section of each chapter is a review of the pertinent physiology. If you need to go over this again to understand how the drugs will act, then use your favorite physio book, not Katzung 
 Overall, this book was terrible.  I will start with the few excellent points this book made:  Many celebrities have horrendous families (3 kids from 3 different men, for example), but this is overlooked while it is practically the only thing people say about poor women (ex: "Welfare Mothers"). The chapter on Welfare Mothers had lots of good points in it-it was worth reading.   They make the point that parents are too "child-centered" now. It is true that some parents let their kids have way too much control and give them way more material goods and attention than they need. Kids don't really need much of either. However, what these authors are promoting is extremely opposite of "child-centered."   The marketing of products moms "need" is out of control. Many moms waste money on irrelevant products and really need to be aware of the marketing aimed at them to try to get them to buy tons of junk. You need to be smart about marketing, good point.   But... then.... the authors make a comment like this: "While it was certainly true that many mothers were looking for toys that were stimulating and compensated for the fact that America still had no national day care or nursery school system, the toy industry always suggested that the new marketing trends were entirely driven by mothers." That's right, it's the lack of national day care that is causing me to become rampantly materialistic! No matter what the problem, these authors will find someone/something to blame it on.   Now, to all the other things that I did not like about this book (where to start!):  The authors go on and on and on about celebrities and how they are portrayed as perfect mothers and workers. Give me a break. Women have to be smarter than to actually believe this nonsense. Please don't blame People for making you feel guilty as a mother. Celebrities are not even in the same class as the rest of us. They can't even compare their lives to ours. And, if they try, you must know it is a bunch of baloney. If you don't want to read about celebrity babies, don't buy People. Don't watch ET. It's really not hard to avoid if it affects you so much.  What was with defending daycare abuse claims? They actually argue about the unfairness towards daycare centers investigated for crimes against children. I agree it is not fair to slander people, but good grief, if there is any reason to be concerned, you have to investigate i.! Parents want to know this stuff, even if it is just alleged. These authors act like working women should not have to read about problems with daycares.   Although the authors think pointing to a few isolated daycare incidents is no evidence of problems with childcare, they seem eager to make a point that a few other isolated cases- Andrea Yates, Susan Smith, babies in dumpsters- is obviously calling attention to a problem with the new "momism." This is the scapegoat for these women who killed their children. No matter what your parenting problem, the authors have an excuse for you!    "Dumb Men, Stupid Choices- Or Why We Have No Childcare:" The authors open with a description of a WWII daycare center. The few that were actually like this were open 24 hours and did your laundry and grocery shopping while you worked, along with meal prep, and taking care of sick children in a special place in the center (which were no doubt this nice because they were a temporary solution for women called from home to do their civic duty). The authors are saying this is what it should be like today......   So then the authors go on to bash everyone who doesn't agree with their childcare position. Then they bring out this stat: "By 1995, 75 percent of kids under five were regularly watched by someone other than their parents." They are implying that 75% of women out there need/want government daycare centers. First of all, that statistic is ridiculous. The 75% stat includes part-time moms (which are about ï¿½ of the 75%). Some of these moms work very few hours, other do "split shifts" with their spouse so their children don't have to go to daycare. Many part-time kids are playing with grandma or auntie and cousins. I really doubt these kids would rather be in big, govt. daycare. Now, of the roughly 37% of moms working full-time, the percentage that have to work to make ends meet is very small. If you also look at the preferences of poor women who have to work, they overwhelmingly like home based and relative care for their children-not huge govt. daycare. They also overwhelmingly, if given a choice, would rather stay home and raise their own children. So, the authors of this book are pushing for a childcare system, of enormous cost, that is the least popular option and will serve a minority of working mothers. Something does need to be done for poor women with small children, but huge govt. daycare centers are not the answer. These women should have a choice in childcare-whether it be grandma, themselves, or their neighbor. It makes much more sense to create policy that lets all parents choose which type of childcare they prefer-even if it is from mom.   Then this comment, "Many young mothers who need a salary-and, frankly, time away from the kids-feel they have no choice but to quit their jobs, either for the sake of the kids, or because they simply can't afford the childcare near them." Are these authors suggesting that the taxpayers pick up the bill for moms who want to get out of the house and work for fun? It sure sounds like it! By the way, where is the rule that says you have to have children? I don't think there is one.....   The authors act like there are no honest women out there who think being a mother is the most wonderful thing in the world, worth every minor inconvenice it brings. They think women who portray motherhood as blissful must be fakes. They are the ones in denial. I'm really not sure why women like these authors feel a calling to publish books trying to convince the public that happy, fulfilled mothers are a "myth." It's no myth for millions, maybe billions, of moms!  In the chapter: "Dr. Laura's Neighborhood" (and in the rest of this book) we learn that if you are a: man, home-schooling mom (except a few minority who the authors think are OK), attachment parenting mom, Christian, conservative, someone who likes organically grown food, happy mother, a member of the "Greatest Generation," someone who likes decorating, pro-life, breastfeeding mom, mother of multiple babies (they especially like to attack you if you used fertility drugs while forgetting there are plenty of moms out there who have had multiples without fertility drugs) or a SAHM-you are not approved by these authors! These authors are pompous and arrogant, thinking they are the be-all-end-all to judge others. These women are clearly driven by some irrational rage against all other mothers who are not exactly like them. This book reads like a nasty note you would find on the floor of a high school, written by a girl who is jealous of the girls in another clique.   
 For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.  This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!   And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).   Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.    Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision 
 I have sold a number of this style timer made by KitchenAid in Pink , Black and White. Almost every buyer complained. All complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room, have a fan on or are listening to the TV or radio. Replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either. If you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the Red, Black, Blue, White or Tangerine ones that are entitled Digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of KitchenAid timers. 
 Morris is worthless and so is his uncreative, lame book 
 This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there.  Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable.  The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles.  There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title "Rope Eater".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain.  Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever.  This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing.  As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment.  
 If you like Pride & Prejudice, you won't like this film. This movie is too dark and foreboding for my taste. Yes, the actors play their parts well, yes the costumes are terrific, but the script leaves you feeling depressed and yelling at the tv, "Enough is enough! 
 I purchased this book specifically because of the "North Carolina" in the title.  However, except for six pages about N. C. frost dates, rain fall and hardiness zones, I've found nothing in this book that is specific to gardening in North Carolina (not to say that it isn't good, basic advice about southern gardening).  I feel cheated 
 We rented this movie, knowing it wouldn't be an Oscar winner or anything. I've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books, but this took the cake. It was so lame! We thought it would at least be entertaining...no luck there. The best part about it was when it ended. What a relief! 
 I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it. -first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined. -It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like  2 seconds for the picture to be taken. -It eats up batteries like crazy -It takes forever to turn on -If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight -The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home -It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice. 
 This is a really weak and uninspired translation - really a rewriting - of Brother Lawrence's classic little book.  The author/translator says that this is a "thought-for-thought" translation rather than a literal one, and admits that this is a risky proposition.  He's right that it's risky, especially when a writer is careless and takes unwarranted license with a text, and unfortunately he's failed in his attempt.  It could and should have been otherwise.  The author goes overboard trying to make the book sound contemporary, filling it with American colloquialisms and excessive informality to the point that it often sounds like a trivial conversation between teenagers ("let's bulldoze the dike that holds back God's flood," "let's cash in lost time," "if death is tailgating us, we need to be ready," "life offers no `do-overs'," don't look for the pleasure payoff," and on and on).  There are places where subject and verb don't agree and other grammatical or stylistic errors cause a lack of clarity.  When a writer allows himself great license, he can't blame problems like these on the original text.  The author has been a news reporter and advertising copywriter, and it shows.  This is too important a book to be treated with this much sloppiness and irreverence.  I'm surprised at NavPress for letting this one slip through, and I strongly suggest that you buy a better version (the Whitaker House version, for example, is better and cheaper) 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 The reader should be aware of the fact that the author of this book was in the process of converting from Buddhism to Catholicism when he wrote it. In fact he then went on and wrote a book specifically about THAT - it is titled "The Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism". In my opinion Williams goes out of his way (and at times quite obviously) to promote the view that Buddhism is inherently nihilistic. Rupert Gethin's "The Foundations of Buddhism" is vastly superior, as are the books by Kogen Mizuno: "Essentials of Buddhism" and "Basic Buddhist Concepts" 
 This is the first book I've read by this author, and I thought it was horrible.  The characters are incredibly unrealistic.  Frankie is the most annoying of them all, second is Grace.  I couldn't relate at all, it took for ever to finish because I couldn't stand reading it, and it was just uninteresting.  I'll probably read another book just to see if this book is    not like her usual work.  I'm now reading a Dean Koontz book (one of my favorite authors), and it's so refreshing to read an author who at least has some characters that are relatable in some way 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 I gave this release only 2 stars because it de-emphasizes their best stuff.  "Jealousy" is one of the best albums I have in my collection of 600+ albums.  "Fire In The Sky" is an awesome song from that album.  I really wish they would have released more stuff like this before they went back to hillbilly 
 The paw works but the quality is very low.  It is made out of cheap plastic and I found paper stuck inside.  The bell rings randomly as others have noted.  The random ringing happens if the button gets stuck down.  It doesn't always pop back up after it is pushed.  It isn't even water  resistent for those thinking of putting it outside.  The intercom part works fine and seems to be of decent quality.  The barking  option is just irritating though 
 The idea of putting together all the texts for the Mary Magdalene tradition is an interesting one; if you're really interested in that subject, you might find this book worth your time and money.    I am, however, losing patience with the misdirection and disingenuity of the growing "Gnostic Gospel" racket.  Dan Brown is rightly criticized, as a novelist, for playng fast and loose with history; as a scholar, Meyer ought to care primarily about historical fact, which is more remarkable in this case than the fantasies.  But he shows a soft spot for the merely sensational.  Meyer introduces his texts as follows: "This book presents English translations of the earliest and most reliable texts that shed light on this remarkable woman and the literary traditions about her."  In fact, only the canonical Gospels (some would add parts of Thomas) have any claim to telling us about the woman; the rest are about the tradition - as Meyer and every serious scholar knows. (Like Karen King, whose parallel book on Mary plays similar, but less blatant linguistic games.) But unlike King, Meyer allows his readers to glide through the entire text of his book without once honestly marking the line between history and legend.     Meyer does draw a line between canonical and extra-canonical works: "Within these texts Mary Magdelene plays a leading role, but often, particularly in the New Testament, the centrality of her role may be obscured by the interests of the authors of the Gospels, who advance the cause of the male disciples (especially the Twelve) and the place of Peter."  So it seems the NT texts "obscure" the truth about Mary for political gain, while the latter are more willing to give her a fair shake.    What could it possibly mean to say the Gospels "obscure" a "fact" that would not be invented for decades, or centuries, after they were written?  Did they have time machines with which they went forward a century, read the Gnostic texts, and returned to the 1st Century to deconstruct them?    Meyer repeatedly commits such gross anachronism (first among deadly sins for historians).  His eye for detecting "spin" is selective: he finds it in the canonical Gospels, but not in the "Gospel" of Mary.  But in the Gospels, the followers of Jesus are shown in all their flaws, none more fully than Peter.  In Mary, by sharp contrast, the favored disciple is presented (as King put it) as a "model disciple," while Peter, her orthodox foil, is intentionally undermined.  So Meyer detects manipulation in texts that describe the "pillars of the church" in all their perversity, pigheadedness, and lack of understanding.  But he sees none in later texts that present heroes and villains in bright, shiny white and black hats, nary a flaw in the one, hardly a virtue in the other!    I have no reason to doubt Meyer's competence as a translator, and the texts themselves can be interesting.  (Though most are readily available elsewhere.)  The "Manichean Psalms of Heracleides" was most interesting to me, partly because I had never read it before, but also because it is a nice poem about Mary at the resurrection of Jesus.  Philip, Thomas, Mary, the Dialogue of the Savior and Pistis Sophia are full of metaphysics, but fortunately in small doses.  The final essay by De Boer is a lot better than I expected; actually a rather balanced discussion of how both Gnostic and orthodox texts treat women, sometimes with some misogeny, but better than the norm for the times.  The reason I expected worse is because earlier, Meyer repeats the ludicrous argument De Boer made elsewhere that the "beloved disciple" was Mary M.  John obscured the fact, and then, after 2000 years of misunderstanding, De Boer finally figured out the truth.  I am always amazed when a scholar calls the author of a Gospel a liar, then feigns to "read between the lines" of his work and tell us "what really happened."  This seems particularly unfair in the case of John, accused by Elaine Pagels of undermining Thomas in a similar way, since in fact John treated male disciples much more roughly than the ladies, and gave us a picture of everyone far more rounded and realistic than any of the Gnostic texts.    All in all, this has the feel of a book Harper & Row hopes for a healthy return on a small investment of capital, time, character, or cottonwood fiber.     author, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Coul 
 Unlike other scholars, Jackson defends paradigms complementary. This book, which comes up with some interesting methodologies for social systems analyses, leads to folly conclusions

 The roast is a light medium.  Tried various grinds with my WEGA espresso machine.  Does not have the body and character to make a good espresso beverage.  Look for a darker roast.   Makes a pretty good drip 
 This book is awful. Crump repeatedly takes unfounded shots at Christians and Clergymen. Eventually I had to give up on the book, it became intolerable.   The rest of the content was mediocre at best. He made very little effort to keep the reader interested. It read more like a lecture from a dull professor. This is not due to my lack of interest in the subject; I'm a 3rd year physics student. Thomas Crump just managed to suck and blow while writing this book. His insulting attitude towards Christianity didn't help. 
 This book is nothing more than the authors' rants against U.S. politics, and its alleged ties to the criminal underworld.  The book is laughable in the extremes the authors go take to link almost every U.S. President since JFK to the criminal underworld.  The worst part is that most of the so-called evidence for these links is from "anonymnous" or "un-named" sources.  Do yourself a favor, and read something else 
 Although errors can seem obvious in some situations, some are not so obvious when the prose describe what is desired, but the code samples provided do not fit the bill.  Expect to spend some time determining if the code actually does what is described.  Download the code samples from the Wrox site and try it for yourself first (start with ch15 for a good example of ample carelessness).  Inconsistent conventions used throughout the book (naming private members of a class for example) also make it more challenging to follow the code samples.  There is also a large portion of the book dedicated to non-php-specific Coding House approaches to business.  Although several sections provide decent and accurate coverage, the book fails to provide a flow to the next section in most cases.  While reading, it is apparent when you have switched to a new author (since they do not follow the best practices presented earlier in the narrative).  If a proper review for errors and some rewriting to tie the sections together were performed, this book could improve, however, I cannot recommend it as is.  If you are not bothered when you skim the table of contents and spot page numbers (chapter 25) being misnumbered, then perhaps the various other errors throughout the book can be overlooked.  I would accept such errors in an online book under review - not from an established publishing house 
 I am a great fan of Bernstein's "Candide".  I saw the 1974 production twice.   My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once.     This DVD should have been an excellent performance.  Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible.   Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image.  I assumed it was a really bad recording job.   Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy? 
 This book was awful.  I read "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject.  To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust.  This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something.  Great.  Now back it up.  You can't just  say, "This is bad and you have to do this!"  Well... I suppose you can.  But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria 
 While the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written, I found the story itself uninteresting and sexist.  I would not recommend this book. 
 I would not advise buying this book for studying for the SCEA exam. It is very badly written and not clear at all. Much of the material is repeated and long-winded. It contains some of the most useless diagrams I've seen in a long time. I would recommend the Mark Cade book and some of the notes and files that are available from other people who sat the exam. (mainly from the Yahoo groups and JavaRanch). The good points of the book are that there are plenty of practice questions and a sample exam.  
 The narrator's voice was so sing-song I thought I was listening to a Valley Girl. If it wasn't for the music it would have been a no star cd. 
 The facts of the history of jade are fascinating, but here are told with tiring meanderings, overlong explanations of tangential topics, and an ending that featured too much of the authors. A chore to get through 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Comedy comes in many forms--everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire--and in "Just Friends" there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types.  First, the movie wants to be a gross-out comedy.  The sight gags are plentiful, the physical comedy abundant and often cruel, and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic.  However, the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy--the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart.  These elements have been combined successfully in the past--"There's Something About Mary" jumps right to mind.  Here, we get something far less successful.  First, the good news.  There are legitimate laughs to be had in "Just Friends" and that was a pleasant surprise.  If you don't care about character development and just want inane humor, you could do worse than this movie.  And if the sight of Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you--check this out right away.  Sadly, it's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite.  There is nothing real at stake here to care about--and the blame for this falls squarely on Reynolds' character (I'll use the word character lightly here).  Reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working--the problem, however, is that he's not in sitcoms anymore.  He's making movies, unfortunately--and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character.  Here, he plays a celebrity insider--a successful, trendy record executive.  And yet, he's not believable as trendy, successful or professional.  His character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero, you never know or understand him--he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag.  It's too bad, really, because Amy Smart--as his love interest--IS playing a character.  I'm not usually a fan, but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down.  But it's Anna Faris that I'm going to single out for the most inspired performance.  The funniest bits to me revolve around her character--a shallow, insane pop star.  Sure, it's an easy target--but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious, over-the-top gusto that she is easily a cast standout.  Again, some humor--no emotion.  If you don't expect much from your comedy, you might just like this.  The fatal flaw for me is that I felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship, but didn't do anything to make it REAL. 
 I love the DK Episode's VI-IV & I,II Vehicles and Locations but I found the Episode III Space ships and Vehicles not all that amuseing I feel that it wasn't a completed book to end the spectacualr tiology books in the detailing of the great space ships and vehicles. The reason why I didn't get this one as my collection was becuase I didn't see Padme's Naboo Skiff, which we really didn't get to see much in the film, but i would of have liked to see the detaling at least . Over all it's a great book but not enough 
 I don't feel that Miller made much of an attempt to prove that Anna was in fact a "good" mother. Like another reviewer said, I don't think she was a BAD mother, but the book really didn't go into much detail about Anna's relationship with Molly (especially up until Anna' ex-husband filed for custody) and instead focused on Anna's life experiences and psyche. After Brian said he wouldn't send Molly back, Anna didn't even seem that concerned about Molly's mental and emotional well-being. She just focused on her notion that Leo's actions were simply taken out of context, and while she wanted to see Molly again, I got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her "rights" as a mother, not out of a concern for her daughter.   And what was so great about Leo anyway?? He wasn't exactly nice to Anna, often condescending to her, and from the beginning I felt that his affection for Molly was a farse, simply to stay on Anna's good side. He also seemed sexually possessive of Anna--like the scene when he kept having sex with her after Molly came into the bed because of a nightmare. I think Anna loved her daughter, but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love, since she had never felt such an attraction before. As a result, her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months, with dire consequences. Although she did show some signs of remorse, she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter's welfare. If she had put her daughter first from the beginning, instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new "family" she and Leo were forming, then she probably never would have lost custody of her child. 
 Not only do they make me look frumpy, the stretchy belly portion of these pants start about 3 inches higher than the pubic bone, which makes them pull very tight when sitting down, especially in the later months of pregnancy. They fit fine at 5 or 6 months along, but at 9 months the denim is too tight for the lower abdomen section.  I end up taking them off for something more comfortable immediately when I get home. 
 Good effort, but get an editor, and write a good sentence! A few good ideas, a resource or two, but not worth the money and the two month shipping time 
 I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on 
 This book is very dated. The instructions are okay if that's all you want, but style-wise this book is old, old, old 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 We got about 5 minutes into the video when my 4 year old started crying, it had frozen, wouldn't work at all. We returned one, got a new one, it freezes too!  We have almost all the Strawberry Shortcake DVD's, and this is the ONLY one we have had a problem with, and the story looks so cute. I think the mass production on this one really got screwed up and I caution buyers to beware.  
 The author doesn't seam to know the theory of linear shift-invariant  systems. Its very easy to see that his proposed double smoothing is just a  convolutions of two EMA filters, and is approximated by a longer EMA, thus  has the same lag 
 While the illustrations were superb, I think this book ultimately portrays an America more in keeping with Ozzie and Harriet's view of it. I realize it's a children's book, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that its author is looking at America from an ivory tower, separated from earth below by a thick, white--VERY WHITE--cloud cover. As I said, I realize this is a childrens book, but the sad fact is, there are many children in this country that wouldn't recognize its contents, since their America is something completely different. I think rather than these fanciful romps, perhaps Mrs. Cheney--as well as Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Bush--should spend some time among America's poorer children and perhaps write something with which they can identify for a chnge. While a lot of children will enjoy this, I as an adult cannot applaud this work knowing how many children the author's husband and his administration have 'left behind. 
 Other than for the stars that were in the cast, I never would have bought this DVD 
 I am an entrepreneur and wanted some inspiration, sadly I just found a lot of crap in this book. There's nothing I can apply, anyone can come up with a book better than this. just by reading the index you know this book was written by someone who has no idea about business. I'll write it for you: chap.1 why do you need a code of honor? 2 who you sorround yourself with will determine your wealth and success 3 creating your code of honor 4 what's your personal code 5 how to enforce the code to ensure championship play 6 leadership that teaches other 7 the biggest impact of the code 8 ensuring account. loyalty and trust 9 standing in the heat with the code conclusion it's your time to have a code  the book is full of phrases like: (please ask yourself if you need to buy a book to learn this:) "nature whats you to go for it" pg 122 "when in doubt support each other" pg 115 "accountability is in the stats, no stats no results" pg 108 "the code is an awesome recruiting tool and qualifier" "steps for creating a code: 1 create a code in a sane environment" "sample code: 1 never abandon a teammate in need 
 This book is so basic and boring. It lacks in visual aids and verbal explanation of the few visuals that it does have. I'll save you some money and some 400+ pages... In a nutshell this book says if someone is smiling they are happy, if they frown they are sad, and if their brow is furrowed they are angry. At the moment my brow is furrowed at the waste of time this turned out to be.  'Nuff said 
 It's a non-live Tour CD!  What kind of retarded marketing scheme is THIS??!!  It is absolutely assanine to title a collection of old studio recordings on a "A Farewell Tour" CD. Besides, this has got to be like the 10th hits compilation these guys have put out!  Don't get me wrong.  I dig their music, and this is a decent single CD compilation, but if you've got the 40 #1s double CD set, what do you need with this?  I would have loved to have heard a live concert recording with the song list on this 20 track CD, but that isn't what you get here.. 
 I was thoroughly unhappy with Fort in "My Lady Notorious."  I was not especially excited to read about him in "Something Wicked," but the reviews were promising.  I should have stuck with my first instinct.  This book was incredibly boring.  I found most of it to be about the plot against the king.  I prefer not to have a whole lot of subplots in my romance novels.    Fort was not a likable hero.  He sired two children out of wedlock and only supported them financially.  What a jerk!  I don't care if that was how things worked in the mid-18th century - I prefer my heroes to be a little more noble than that.  Elf bordered on desperate.  Fort didn't deserve the attention or pursuit she afforded him.  I think Fort should have realized his folly and pursued Elf.  He was the jerk all along and should have been the one to lose his pride and pay the price.  Fort thoroughly debauches Elf and her brothers barely batted an eye.  It seemed out of character for all of the Mallorens.  And speaking of out of character, where was Elf's spunk?  She became a doormat and showed very little backbone in dealing with Fort.  Some reviewers here on Amazon have commented on this book's sizzle.  I have to say - I completely disagree.  There were only a couple of sex scenes and they were short and very undetailed.  If you are someone who likes vague, veiled sex scenes, this book's for you.  The ending seemed abrupt and a disappointing ending for such a long, drawn-out story.  I wouldn't waste my time with this one 
 Despite careful aiming, this has exactly, and I mean exactly, the same signal strength as my cheapie $6 Airlink 7db omni, and is weaker than my homemade Pirouline cantenna. Probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap, but save your money if you're expecting 15db performance 
 This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide 
 Oh dear. This is a really poor book, and I'd advise you to save your money and buy something else.  Bourg's first book on game development (on Phyiscs) suffered poor reviews for being shallow, not presenting real-world techniques, and glossing over huge gaping problems in his approach. This book has all the same problems, and even more strongly in places.  Firstly he makes a big point of saying that the book is aimed at novice developers and he will cover only a few techniques designed to get you up and running. In his list, however, he has genetic algorithms, neural networks and production systems, all of which large AI teams for major developers find it very hard to get working usefully (e.g. finding an application suited for a GA in a game is just about impossible). His approaches are in places laughable.  Secondly he then lauds completely inappropriate algorithms. His steering system is based on potential functions, for example, and he proposes this because he says it allows you to mix several different movement concerns. This is completely disingenuous to his readers. The technique is very simple and useful only when several concerns are NOT blended together. When you mix things you ALWAYS get wells-of-attraction and your characters get stuck hopelessly. Just about ANY other technique would improve on this (and there's no use just saying 'do pathfinding' either: there's much more mileage in steering algorithms).  And the final thing that annoyed me was his approach all the way along of saying 'I'm only going to show you a few techniques'. Trying to make the selling point of the book that it doesn't cover anywhere near enough ground to get your AI up and running!  Just about every chapter had significant problems in it. His knowledge of the subject wouldn't pass a sophomore AI exam (I've taught AI courses at University: I'm not exaggerating). It is full of innaccuracies (e.g. he says 'new AI' is non-deterministic, while 'old AI' is deterministic - a moronic comment).   If you are a novice trying to get going in AI, this book will seriously harm you development. Try John Funge's new book, or the new Morgan Kauffman book (you'll have to wait a few months). Even reaching through the two AI Programming Wisdom will see you far better prepared for real development, despite the odd lemon of an article in them 
 I decided to get a portable XM that could record.  I love to listen to Coast to Coast AM, but I can not stay up and hear it at 1am.  I decided on the Inno for myself and went to get it.  Last minute at the store my husband wanted an XM, but was hesitant to spend the extra money for the Inno.  That was about a month ago. Last night he went ahead and bought an Inno for himself.  The NeXus, while cheaper, did not function as well.  He had a hard time finding his recordings and they did not seem to play in order.  Overall he felt that instead of an upgrade from an old Roady, this was a step back. It did not work well, he had lots of problems with playing music he loaded onto the unit.  The screen was not in color.  It would lock up a lot. It was a pain to carry the passport everywhere with the NeXus.  I would recommend getting the Inno.  In the long run you will be much happier 
 I found this book to be fairly useless. It provides good definitions to all the key aspects/elements/entities in the pharmaceutical space but there was little practical material. I was looking for a reference about how to put a marketing plan together and what a pharmaceutical plan would look like and did NOT find it in this book.  It was also sparse on pharma specific frameworks. It describes Porter's 5 Forces, the three C's and of course the four P's but you can get that in any marketing/strategy book. There must be something better out there that is better suited to pharma 
 Don't waste your money on this book.  Unlike the regular PDR's it does not contain much information, and when looking for herbal remedies that your patients are using, most of them are NOT in here.  The supplement name index is only nine pages (most books are at least fifteen to twenty). On the positive side, it does mention the actual studies used for reference under each heading in the article with specific details of the studies and I did find "Bee Pollen," which I could not find in the other books I had. Two cheaper and more helpful books are the "Encyclopedia of Nutritional Supplements," by Michael T. Murray, N.D. and "The New Encyclopedia of Vitamins, Minerals, Supplements, and Herbs," by Nicola Reavley. These are both well-referenced to medical journals and will also discuss risks and benefits of the remedy (you will need to look for the names of the articles in the reference section, listed by footnote number). When comparing drugs in the PDR to the other two books, much of the information is the same. In addition, these other two books can be used to look up a condition and find a remedy for it.  I am still looking for a comprehensive resource for physicians 
 This book started out with some interesting ideas and character development but fizzled quickly.  In the first few chapters we are introduced to Joanna who is coming of age in a supernatural way.  Then, she hides out in a sanctuary for nearly the entire remainder of the book!  Basically talking incomprehensible mytho-babble and contemplating her navel.  I couldn't even finish the book - I was so bored by the time she finally planned to face the bad guys that I didn't even care how `the big battle' turned out and I just closed the book without reading it. 
 I don't like this CD at all what happeed to the classy Monica???   Too Ghetto.... Such a waste of such a beautiful voice!!   
 A compilation of few interesting ideas and very hard to see illustrations. Poor quality reproductions.  No measurements at all.  Furthermore the contact information in the back was not cross-referenced with the designs & listed no phone or web contact, just mailing addresses.  Seems like the authors took the cheap and easy way out with a good idea.    Taunton Press's "The Cabin" is a much more inspiring & informational book.  I do not recommend this book.  
 I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book.  I still can't believe some of the things I read.  Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an "obsession" with photography.  I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography. She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape.  To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience.  But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision.  Self-consciousness is not exactly rape.  Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns.  The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all.  Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.   Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description.  Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy "steals" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain.  This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books.  Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been "stealing" other people's lives, their pain, etc.  Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin.  I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes.  How is Strand's photographing the famous "Blind Woman" different from Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood?" My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation.  She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops.  For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche.  Really?  Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded.  I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the "everyone" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her. Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre.  Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world.  I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography. One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically.  This is despite her inclusion in her "Anthology of Quotations" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them.  Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera.  Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's "After the Fall," which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe.  There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty.  In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and "stealing the pain of others" than does photography 
 I really enjoy the Dorothy Martin character; she's wonderfully self-confident and true to herself at all times. But this book is just  barely a mystery--I felt really let down at the end. Great characters and  interesting setting can't make up for a weak (to be generous) plot 
 This book is a perfect example of people in ivory towers, and those who are afraid to admit they don't get it, jumping on a 5-star bandwagon. Faulkner titled this book perfectly, calling it The Sound And The Fury, while leaving out the rest of the phrase: signifying nothing. The first chapter is a noble, but failed, attempt at creativity. But almost no one, even the most well-read people, understands that the first chapter is written out of chronological order until they find out someplace else. The chapter's main point was as an excuse to get in Faulkner's description of what instigated the novel, a somewhat kinky description of looking up at the girl Caddy's muddy panties. A fatal flaw in the chapter, which never achieves a rhythm, is that Benjy, whose thoughts comprise the chapter, apparently has a photographic memory and thinks in completely lucid, complete sentences despite being an idiot. Caddy, the main character in a novel of stereotypes and pitiful prose, is actually a despicable trollop. She's characterized as Benjy's friend, but a careful reading shows that she only befriends him when it's convienent for her. Other chapters are even more sick than Benjy's castration, including the one with Caddy's brother lusting after her, or the hackneyed, cliché chapter with the old slave showing how much wiser she is than folk she serves. The Cliffs notes and other reviews perpetuate the idea that the book's theme is the downfall of the old plantation system. This is an invention; not found in the book. S&F, as Faulkner loudly hints in the title, is about nothing other than his infatuation with Caddy. It has no plot. And it is far from a great insight into the way people think. Only perverts think as these characters do. In the end, this novel is just page after page of sheer boredom. It's supposed to be a great book of human tragedy, but to feel tragedy you have to sympathize with the characters ... and all of the white characters in this novel are disgusting. All of its supposed great meaning, and the flip-flop in reviews from castigating to praising the experimental style, weren't dreamed up until 15 years after the first printing flopped, by literary professors who have to keep coming up with new ideas under the "publish or perish" law. It was only revisited because Faulkner did, eventually, write some good books. You want truly great writing? Try Steinbeck, Welty, Hemingway, Harper Lee, Dickens, Twain, Tolkien, Melville, Dostoyevsky, O. Henry, Wells, Verne, Maugham, Crane or even Rowling (Yes, Rowling. Her Potter books are complex, effortlessly intertwine several story lines and sublimely combine strong characterization, suspense and humor) 
 THIS BOOK WAS PROVIDED TO ME BY THE SCHOOL I ATTEND TO PREPARE FOR THE CNA.  THIS BOOK IF FULL OF USELESS TID BITS.  I HATED THE QUIZZES AND ZEN.   ONCE IT FINALLY GOT TO THE INFORMATION, IT WAS VAGUE AND DISORGANIZED. IF I  HAD TO RELY ON THIS BOOK TO PASS I WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE IT.  LUCKLY, I HAD  AN EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR 
 Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype. Oooo, no "sulfates"... Oooo, "essential water".... Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...  I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo. And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.  This product truly deserves 0 stars!! 
 This book was so full of a trying-to-hard Austen language that  it was very annoying.  I didn't get past the first chapter.  The development of Margaret seemed fake and not in a way Austen had her heading in her novel.  Margaret desired to travel, but nothing is said of this.  Something like this would not disappear in three years.  Authors shouldn't stray from the original author's intention 
 This book is also similar to the Kaplan California Star Program Workbook: Grade 9.  It only covers Pre-Algebra, which most students take in 7th grade.  I am a 9th grader and I take Algebra II and this does not cover ANYTHING in that course.  We bought this book thinking that it would include Calculus and other higher levels of math, but it only includes simple math.   In a few words, this book is a waste of time and money.   I would never recommend for anyone to purchase this book 
 This product feels like grain on the face, I don't care for that feel. They should improve that. Other wise I suppose it does the job 
 Overrated; slapstick; stupid. This movie gives "gay" a black eye. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch men dress like women and act like female dogs, then you will probably really love this movie. Honestly, you have better things to do with your time...and there are much better gay movies out there.  Try Maurice or Brokeback Mountain 
 He's a superb athelete, a hard worker and highly intelligent. But he's slick as he can be and contemptously refers to "square Johns" by which I think he means non-hustlers. He spent his Army career fixing sports events and participated in other dubious activities. The book is candid and moderately interesting but I have to admit, I wouldn't like to meet this man in person. He seems incapable of making an honest deal. Seems like he's gotta hustle everybody 
 This movie isnt worth the time to read this review. It sucks and I'm a big Trinity fan. My advice is keep searchin 
 This lab manual is overpriced even by college textbook standards.  It is nicely bound, but made with crap paper.  The labs in it are made overly tedious with extra, uneeded steps to confuse a student.  
 I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes.  In fact, I gave it to a sociology PhD candidate studying Chinese culture for a good laugh.  I regret parting with it because it is quite a unique artifact, being quite comprehensive in its stereotypes of various Asian nationalities.  Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize.  As such, I might recommend it, but only with the caveat that its contents should not be taken as authoritative 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 We recieved two of these for my daughter's first birthday. She LOVES being in the pool but this float ALMOST changed EVERYTHING!!!! The inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up. My daughter FREAKED OUT!!!! She had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this. DO NOT waste your money 
 Mr. Halberstam continues his decline as a serious journalist. This odious valentine to the 50's Red Sox should come complete with a hanky. Ted Williams & co. deserve better 
 I use this type of flash drive for my research and more than half the time I can never view the images on the computer or get the flash drive to work....not worth buyin 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 I look for games to play at family get togethers and simple dinner parties. After reviewing all of the games in the book, I found only one that I could use. The others require too much preparation. For instance, "Mad Advertising" has you record 20 commercial from the TV and find an obscure question to ask about the commercial. When the game begins, you show the commercial and ask the question, and see who gets the most correct answers. That's too much time and trouble, and not that fun. 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 God's Politics  Jim Wallis  Absolutely horrible book.  With a name like "God's Politics", I expected an objective, constructive view of local, national, and international political science through the lens of theology.  Instead, we have a myopic novel filled with complaints, whining, personal attacks against President Bush (while overlooking everything any democrat has failed in), generalizations, assumptions, and short sighted optimism that completely neglects reality.       The author uses large words in an attempt to sound intellectual, but the complete lack of substance behind his arguments shows his ignorance.   Specifically, the author's two main premises are that the war in Iraq/Afghanistan is (and has always been) unjust, and that we need to have vastly more government support of the poor.      On the issue of the war, the author completely overlooks the fact that the terrorist ideology clashes with our own, and that they hate us purely because we are non-Islamic and stand in opposition to their proposed way of life.  He states that we needed to get to know their "grievances", but overlooks the fact that we HAVE known their grievances and are unable to satiate them.  He overlooks the fact that a small minority, with access to WMD or aircraft or an endless supply of other destructive means, is all that it takes to cause a 9/11, and the only means to combat them is to overthrow the nations that sponsor them (which we did), and to instill freedom so that the "silent majority" in these nations can police themselves (in progress, via the war) and become open to the free exchange of ideas (think evangelism).  He alleges that the goal of the war was "imperialism" and "empire", and ignores the fact that we are only there long enough to get out and we are, in fact, trying to leave.   He states that we should've built international support rather than war, but overlooks the fact that we did, in fact, try to do just that, and that the international community further showed by their lack of interest (over the last ten years) that they wouldn't help.  He states alleges that we are targeting "women and children" in the war, and completely overlooks the care we are taking to avoid collateral damage that the terrorist are trying their best to inflict.  He also ignores the fact that Jesus will return with a sword (Revelation), that the centurion was commended for his faith and not chastised for his profession (Matthew 8), that violence does indeed have a place (Matt 21, Mark 11, John 2).  He routinely makes judgment of others (in violation of Matt 7, which he himself mentions time and again against President Bush), by repeating the buzz word "bad theology" over and over again (without biblical reference or factual justification).  He hurls out words like "blasphemy" and "idolatry" in describing President Bush, but never specifically addresses them.  The author speaks eloquently about how we should "beat our swords into plowshares" (Micah 4:3), but he completely neglects Nehemiah's requirements of self protection and keeping a sword by our side, as there are those that would destroy us (Nehemiah 4:18).  Speaking of "bad theology", perhaps the author should note that we'll be able to "beat our swords into plowshares" AFTER Christ's return!  Peace on earth is a noble goal, and one we are trying to accomplish; NOTHING would please President Bush more... but the author poses no realistic solutions, when the threat is properly analyzed.    The author actually goes so far as to present an ultimatum... "will we stand with the Global Church, or with the American Government".   His audacity is amazing.  He states that President Bush thinks that he is on a personal, ordained mission to "end evil throughout the world", and wonders why we never invaded the other "evil" dictatorships (perhaps, because the President never saw it as a mission, and they didn't impose the imminent danger of harboring terrorists like Iraq and Afghanistan?).  He even mentions that we have not found a single shred of WMD in Iraq (does he even read the news?  we have indeed found countless WMD, albeit small and scattered).  In a breath (without amplification or example), the author even compares Bush policy with "First Century Rome".   On the example of the poor, he completely overlooks that, by lowering taxes and focusing on economic growth, we are creating jobs and ending the welfare spiral that the author seems to endorse.  Additionally, he overlooks the fact that our prosperity yields more to tithe, which is a better way to spend money helping out the poor than stifling tax rates, government bureaucracy, and welfare spirals (Matt 25).  He doesn't offer one instance of scripture supporting his personal view that government's roll is to support the populace, and I'd argue that government's role is to create the conditions for the populace to take care of themselves, or that charity organizations (supported through the nation's prosperity) are best suited for such tasks.   Although he pleads a truly excellent case for why we, as Christians, are called to help the poor, he offers no realistic solutions on how to accomplish it, and thus falls well short of his goal of defining "God's Politics".      The author, to his credit (albeit VERY briefly), touches on a few good points.  He makes excellent example of leaders like Dr Martin Luther King, Jr, and civic leaders who took their bible in hand to the steps of the capitol.  He mentions a few good points, such as the importance of applying the whole scripture to our actions, avoiding being manipulated by politicians, and the intrinsic value of religion to preserving morality and ethics.  He does point out that there is a tremendous need among the world's poor for our assistance.  But by continuing on and on (and ON and ON) in "Bush Bashing" while neglecting to mention the failures of a SINGLE democrat, he loses all credibility and seems to show that the primary purpose of his book is to undermine the President's support base, which the author attempts to accomplish by lies and deception.   Also, by mentioning his magazine by name (repeatedly), he shows that a secondary purpose of the book is self-promotion (invokes the name of God in promoting his magazine).  I really don't see that the purpose was EVER an objective review of "God's Politics". 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 This book had so many chances to develop thought-provoking story lines, but instead jumped out of a story as quickly as it was started.  The characters were quite bland, as many weren't even given a chance to be explored before the focus changed yet again.  This was an easy read in terms of the length, but a hard read due to boring storylines 
 Derek Bok in his latest book, Our Underachieving Colleges, paints a picture of colleges that is equivocal as to their progression or regression in respect of their academic performance. He see's much room for improvement and it is probably in this sense that the title mentions, "Underachieving." Of all the concepts he discusses none gets more ink than that of "critical thinking." And he gives it enough description to convince me that he does not understand it anymore than the professors in education schools do. He finds that "formal logic" and "advanced calculus" do not qualify as examples of critical thinking- and he couldn't be more wrong. Logic and mathematics are the most important types of critical thinking that have been tested over time. These are the indispensible tools of scientists and if scientists are not the most knowledgable practitioners of critical thinking, then who is? (I speak as a former scientist.)  Later in his book he tangentially acknowledges that colleges have deteriorated in certain respects, as in "grade inflation." He presents very little quantitative information- data- showing that our colleges are underachieving. There is no mention of the Graduate Record Examinations that one would think would be a good measure of undergraduate student performance and a yard stick by which comparisons could be made temporally and between colleges.  In researching his book he could have surveyed the research of the U.S. Department of Education wherein there are statistics suggestive of not only underachieving colleges but of their degradation over time. For example, the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy suggests that college graduates today only perform about as well as college juniors of ten years earlier.  The book has too much politically correct terminology and lacks the kind of critical thinking that a scientist would recognize. But "fuzzy logic" is perhaps a better descriptor of the arguments presented in the book.  I'm not sure in what circumstance I would recommend this book to others 
 I'm repeating myself, but then so is Jessica! Nice...but forgettable 
 This may be a wonderful show and I think it is great that a lot of old TV shows are now available on DVD... BUT I was either three or four years old when I first saw this on TV, no doubt one of my older sisters was watching, and it scared the crap out of me. I will admit I was taken with Marina because she was so pretty but I'm 42 years old and to this day I am scared of puppets and mannequins, also large dolls creep me out..I don't know if this is so great for real little children. 
 Alice Randall's original concept for "The Wind Done Gone" was for it to be a parody of "Gone with the Wind" in the style of "Shamela."  I haven't read "Shamela" (or "Pamela," which it is based on), but from what I have gathered, "Pamela" is a story about a virtuous woman who scorns her employer's advances, while in "Shamela," this woman is turned into a whore who was playing her employer all along.  If Randall was trying to make a story like that, then she succeeded.  If "Gone with the Wind" was a world of strong, intelligent, good white Southerners and their stupid but kind-hearted black slaves; then "The Wind Done Gone" is a novel where those white people are shown to be morons and fools who understand little and are really controlled by those they thought they ruled (unless they're gay, like "Dreamy Gentleman" and "Beauty" - then they're nice people).  In this sense, "The Wind Done Gone" succeeds.  Unfortunately, Randall was so busy ripping down the characters of "Gone with the Wind" that she forgot to create her own.  I totally agree that Cynara/Cinnamon/Cindy is a Mary Sue.  Unfortunately, she's not a very interesting one.  She spends most of the story whining and moping about how she is so beautiful yet no one will ever accept her because she is black and she can't believe her parents betrayed her and on and on and on...  The only time she does anything is when she leaves R. and enters into an improbable menage-a-trois with a black Congressman and a black woman who reminds her of Mealy Mouth (Melanie).  By that time, I could care less.  With a boring heroine (and that's particuarly insulting, considering what a complex heroine Scarlett O'Hara was) and a story that goes nowhere, this book doesn't have much.  I didn't buy that any of the characters of "Gone with the Wind" would act as they did in this book.  The idea of Scarlett taking blame for something Cynara did, Melanie killing a slave out of anger, or Gerald having sex with Mammy is preposterous.  However, if Randall had managed to make an interesting story, I would have forgiven it.  Unfortunately, she didn't.  The only character who really benefited from any revision was Lady (Ellen O'Hara) but the revelation that she had black blood seemed to only make an unclear point.  This book is good as a curiosity, and nothing more.  
 I am writing a review not after reading the book, but because I have had the opportunity to sit with this man and question him in India. I found that he had a rapt audience of devoted listeners who seemed to relish his antics of exploding peoples preconceived egoistical ideas. All well and good. But I have been an ardent student of Non-dual traditions for over twenty years, and have sat with many different teachers from different traditions, and I can honestly say that this man is certainly no Buddha. He is a very clever man, and he has a a very strong intellectual understanding of the philosophy...a virtual advaita heavyweight champion. But he lacks the boundless compassion and unconditional heart that is the quality of any great realized being. Instead, Karl delights in the "de-construction" process with the zeal of a pre-pubescent boy, ridiculing and taunting people just to get them to break down. He sidesteps all direct questioning regarding him, and justifies all his rude behavior with the idea that he has no ego, and therefor anything goes. (very dangerous to be propogating this notion to the gereral public) His intellect makes him immune to any real exploration into his very obnoxious and unorthodox way of teaching. I think he has a very big ego... so big that he has succesfully shielded it from his own eyes. Apart from respecting his sharp intellect and strong understanding of Advaita philosophy, I think he is doing a  major disservice to non-dual teachings by posing as some figure of enlightenment. If you are inspired by his teachings, thats great. Even tyrants can make wonderful teachers. Just dont go calling him a Buddha, please 
 This book is a quick reference for anyone dealing with the UML.  It provides brief, but thorough, examples of what is in the models.  I recommend this for managers who need to have some basic facts, so they can speak better to UML practioners 
 Kristy in Charge was maybe the stupidest BSC book I ever read. I like BSC a lot but this one really disappointed me. A short story was made long and  it was kind of boring. It was a little interesting, but not really. And Ann  M. Martin favors Kristy too much---shouldn't the other BSC members have  Great Ideas more often? Do not read this book if you are looking for  excitement because you won't find it here 
 Oh, I forgot.... everyone in ancient Israel spoke with an English accent. That's right. This movie is just plain uninteresting. To begin with, an entirely different actor plays David for the first 30 minutes of this movie. He's supposed to be the young David but when Richard Gere finally appears as David, they look absolutely nothing alike. The story just wonders. It doesn't seem very well directed and I found it very hard to stay interested. Get "David: The Bible Collection" dvd. It is much, much, better. 
 When I saw this book at the bookstore I imagined it would be very good, a train ride trough the continent!, it is really about complaining on everything, he should have stayed home!, I kept reading because I was expecting it to get better, but it really did not, this was the first and last of his books that I buy, I am sorry but as a traveler I expected much more, I could not imagine a more unfriendly person writting about travels 
 We bought this because the picture looked great. First of all, the instructions are poor, and require one to take a piece off before putting another on. More importantly, one of the holes was missing where the door is supposed to pop in. Consequently I had to drill it myself. Next, the door is warped, and the two doors do not fit together. Third, the back panel, does not fit in properly, because the the two shelves do not adhere correctly to the slot. All in all, a very poor constructed item, not worth anywhere near the price. I will most likely return it, even though it is put together. It just does not look very good.      Oh, another thing, it is packed with styrofoam, which broke up and got all over our room when I opened the box. It took over a half hour to vacuum the crap off of the pieces 
 This game system is horrible. My son w anted it for Xmas and he played it once cause its so bad. The graphics are like PS1 at best and the load times are unbearable. Im' talking a good 5 minutes just to get started...stay away from this. 
 This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat. This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles) Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant, but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess 
 After waiting so long for a new Mack 10 album, I figured it'd be somethin' incredible seeing as how long it took.  Things just do not always get better with age.  There are only a few stand-out tracks here.  Most of it is a dime a dozen.  The production isn't too bad, really laid-back type stuff.  The lyrics are pretty dull however.  Save your money for tha next WSC album.  Notable Tracks:  Like This Da Bizness I'm A Star My Chuck 
 The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing 
 Well....the title for my review says it all. Spend your money on GGW Endless Spring Break Vol. 2 for more entertainment 
 I have read several Catherine Coulter books and I am afraid to say they keep getting worse !  I really enjoyed her writing at first; kept looking  for all of her stories. But after reading so many, I find the major  difference between each of her characters, especially the men, is their  names. There are a few unique traits perhaps with each of them, however,  they are so closely related they have become easily predictable. Most of  the men have been in the same situation, say the exact same things, treat  the women identically in every story, to which the women respond  identically in each...etc. This one in particular was the very worst, at  some points, I actually laughed at the silliness of the characters. I  really couldn't believe how ridiculous some of the dialogue was.I thought I  would finish the novel despite my disappointment but I just can't. I could  go on but there's really no point.  Ms. Coulter is a fine writer, I just  wish she would write a different story...maybe put some real effort into  it 
 A fine example of what Smooth Jazz is.  Far too many Electronic Musical subsitutions, in place of true Musical instruments.  Echo chambers, are another failure.  Creates a haunting sound but that is about all.  Where is the rhythm?  Missing in action.  True musical instruments, and maybe single mic recording would be a vast improvement.  Oh yes and some improvisation.  I hope K.BRENT OF ORANGE COUNTY, CA, takes note.  This INDIVIDUAL obviously has never heard real Jazz 
 get loved by few hated by many cause this is exactly the same cd 
 The Rumble in the Jungle is a seminal moment in boxing, and for that reason alone it deserves an account. The fact that a boxing fan/skilled writer and social critic wrote the account would appear to be to the benefit of the reader. And Mailer does two things particularly well. The first is his description of the fight itself, which captures the drama of the struggle in a captivating and thrilling manner. The second is Mailer's attention to the political struggle in Zaire during the '60's (This is akin to holding a title fight in Serbia in the mid-90's). But, Mailer has to ruin a great little book by injecting himself into the action. He doesn't have to be the fly on the wall and he has every right to admit his personal bias.  But it's nauseatingly tiresome to refer to yourself in the third person and speculate as to how people think about you, "the famous writer." What an unbelievable ego. It's not only an annoying personal trait, but it disrupts the flow of the book and takes from the titular reason that many people picked up this book. See if your library has it, but don't bother paying for a very good account marred by one man's need to talk about himself. 
 Unless you are thrilled by crude language don't bother,as this book really doesn't offer anything else. i read it as i am a penn + Teller fan but it was very disappointing 
 [First of all: I only gave this one star because the rating doesn't let you go any lower] I only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it, leaving me to pick it up. I proceeded to suffer through it so I could give you fair warning. If you buy this, consider yourself warned 
 Ya this CD is okay.  Its just really generic nu-metal.  I like nu-metal a lot its just some it sounds the same and brings nothing new and that is Linken Park.  I don't hate this, I just think it is kind of boring and not that cool.  Partially why this does not get 3 stars is that since this band got so big for a while you kind of expect it to be great nu-metal, but its just plain.  Not great, not terrible 
 Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well: 1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system.  2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN.  Look at this comparison Windows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MB  Windows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG!  If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)    What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory!  This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT 
      It's about a boy who started out in kindergarten. He found out that he would be in school a long time. He had a problem and through-up every were any given moment.       The only thing i liked about this book is that it had a somewhat ok plot. And it it's about a boy and his life.       The main thing i didn't like this book because it was pretty dull and boring. I fell asleep most of the time i started to read it. If you realy realy realy like books that you might think it's ok. It just was not like somthing in real life... but it was not a good fictional story also.      This book was not very interesting. It was pretty much like if you HAVE to read a book for i'd say ok. But if you wanna read it for fun... i wouldn't if i was you.  
 Let me start off by saying that I am a huge supertramp fan. Now that I have that out of the way, let me say that this album kind of sucks. I was very dissapointed after I listened to this embarrassing effort. Hopefully this isn't considered as a "good night," because in my opinion I think this live music just isn't nearly as good as their studio recordings. I will admit, even though I love supertramp, the band is a "polished prog-rock" band that just can't make good music live. At least this album says so, I haven't heard any other life supertramp stuff. I have had this album for about a year and I think I've listened to it all the way through about once... I usually get too disgusted with it before the end. Especially Rick Davies' parts. I don't mean to pick on anyone, and I love Rick's album ballads, but unfourtunately on this album Rick crashes and burns evey time he opens his mouth. Because I am such a big supertramp fan, I really am embarrassed when I hear this. Unfourtunately I have been spoiled by great live albums like "How The West Was Won", "Is There Anybody Out There?", and "Live At Leeds." Maybe that's just it, maybe you can't compare supertramp to stuff like that. What I noticed also was the weak music that seems to be dominating throughout this. When I listen to supertramp I am expecting some complex, full, and well thought out sounds, but when I hear this I hear simple, rushed, and very weak beats and tunes. Don't get me wrong, there are some pretty good live versions of songs here but that is about it. The rest is pretty weak. If you are planning to buy this I suggest saving it for completing your collection. I suggest their main four albums - "Breakfast In America", "Even In The Quietest Moments", "Crisis What Crisis?", and of course "Crime Of The Century" which is one of the best albums I have had the privelage to put to my ears. So I would get this only if you are completing your supertramp collection because other than that, it really isn't necceassary 
 I have been a knitter for over 40 years and am adept at reading patterns.  This particular book was written assuming people had taken her class.  If you haven't the insturctions are skimpy at best.  I was very disappointed.  I tried to email her at her email from the book and received no response. 
 I found this in the philosphy section of a local store and was intrigued by the timely theme and title. Nothing else proved commendable about this book. This is the sort of book that gives philosphy a bad name. A dense fog of jagron so abstract that it almost seems like a parody.   I must admit I could not finish this book. I was barely able to penetrate the first two chapters. Several honest attempts to scan the rest of the book read like pure gibberish 
 This one is rather small and doesn't really look or feel like the rest.  Not as durable feeling as the others 
 Recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and I couldn't believe my eyes.  The magazine is a skeleton of its former self, with slim stories and little science.  Bob Guccione Jr's mag is not even that fun to read.  On the happier side, the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations 
 My $200 roomba which I loved to use daily for picking up dog hair stopped charging after 8 months.  I was appalled to find that a new battery was $50+ and delayed buying one for a long time.  I finally caved, got the new battery, charged it and used it once for 20 minutes, and it hasn't charged since.  What a disappointment and waste of money 
 I was anticipating a wonderful diary of an amazing journey by an Englishwoman of privilege over the Western Plains of the American West--what I got was a narrative history of the Mormon religion and its ups and downs.  Having read many diaries of Pioneer women, this one attracted me because Jean Rio started out in England with a small fortune at her disposal.  I was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on Brigham Young and so little of it on Jean.  
 While you may find Bill Maher's performance "thought provoking" or "vomit inducing" depending upon your political slant, the fact remains that this is an UNFUNNY comedy show.     Bill rants and raves about the same topics he has in the past, but its a political stump speach, not a humorous standup routine.  If you have misfourtune of watching this, you will notice that there is almost no laughter from the audience.  Sure, he gets applause, because he's preaching liberal ideals to Californians, but there is little laughter.      If you want political stumping, turn on the TV.  If you want Comedy, go watch someone funny. 
 I wanted to like this book, but I found it disappointingly thin.  I wouldn't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as "hopeless", but it's certainly superficial: Postman seems to rely on secondary sources about Enlightenment thought, rather than any deep reading of Enlightenment texts.  The idea of "building a bridge to the 18th century" seems more like a marketing device, a fresh way of presenting some of Postman's familiar themes, than a serious proposition (He even includes a summary of his "disappearance of childhood" argument in an appendix).  It's a shame, really, because the Enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long, and Postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what's good and admirable about contemporary society to Enlightened thinking.  For a much more substantial survey and defence of Enlightenment thought and culture, read Roy Porter's _The Creation of the Modern World: The British Enlightenment_ 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 This movie is a great example of what's wrong with too many action adventure movies these days.  The concept is great, the special effects flawless.  Charlize Theron is terrific in the role.  The directing is wonderful.    What's the problem?  They forgot that even with action movies, you still need to tell a story.  The plot has one small twist, then lies as straight as a road through Montana.  It is sort of kind of a detective "uncovering the information" plot, but none of the information uncovered is surprising or even interesting.  You are not told how Aeon Flux gets to be a super ninja babe, and she barely has time to establish herself as one before she has to start revealing her softer feminine side in the stereotypical way these movies require.  None of the characters in this movie are compeling.  They hardly show the bad guys doing bad things so you aren't really all that invested in them getting their comeuppance.  There is no real tension in the movie, there is no last minute saving of anything, and not really that much of a threat that gets overcome.    Overall, it was a cool idea, but they should have hired some actual writers who had a sense of storytelling to do the script 
 It is hard to believe this book was written by an adult professional.  Some of the activities suggested involve encouraging the dog to behave in undesirable ways, such as barking excessively, running wildly through the house, or attacking your shoes.  Others, such as "walking lessons" where you grab the dog by it's legs and force him to walk, seem to border on abusive.  I was looking for more activities to do with my Lab, and didn't find one 
 The company/shipping was fine.  No beefs there.  The product itself I find to be rather damaging to the skin.  In order to extract, you have to press down EXTREMLY hard, (If you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  I can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  I wouldn't reccomend this product. I just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  : 
 I bought it and was extremely disapointed.  I think that I got the shaft.  It was represented as a new novel.  Instead, it was 2 old novels combined into one book. Buyer beware, I think that this is a case of gross advertising deception 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 This CD contains: 2 long remixes of The Hand That Feeds, the orginal song, and the music video.   The two remixes on this CD sound exactly the same and aren't all that good. It comes with the orginal version of the song "The Hand That Feeds" and also the music video (but in terrible quality). So you're basically buying 1 bad remix.  This is one of the worst NIN remix CDs I've ever heard. If you're not a hardcore fan (meaning, you don't own every Halo) then don't waste your time with this CD 
 My goal in reading an assembly book is to eventually learn fasm. I must say, after reading the first 2 chapters of this book, I am very disappointed! I definitely REGRET the fact that I paid for this book before looking into it further. I have a working knowledge of C++ and I must say, HLA looks more like C++ than fasm code. I can only surmise that the good ratings this book has gotten are from people who haven't seen traditional assembly code, and are convinced that its "assembly" or are actually interested in learning HLA. For a more traditional lesson in assembly I would recommend Assembly Language Step-by-Step Programming with DOS and Linux ISBN: 0471375233  Although I have skimmed through the entire book, it is true that I have not entirely completed this book. I am in fact a bit nervous about the idea of finishing it. I however, am going to finish it. If I feel that the book has enlightened me to the ways of assembly through some profound psychological trickery, I will let people know at Random-Seed.net 
 This is 5th edition of the book written in early 90th (first edition was in 1994). The book did not change much since. This is fuzzy, politically correct and watered down presentation of the subject. For example when you learn about cognitive dissonance you are not told that the original Festinger experiment was connected with the behavior of a flood doomsday cult after the target date of the flood passed.    This might be an OK book as a second of third book for self-education (you can save money buying any previous edition, but in no way this should be your first or only book on the subject), but this can be a horror show if this is your standard textbook at the university 101 Social physiology course and you need to pass an exam.  Here the inability of the authors to distinguish between important and unimportant will hunt you down.   The authors are too fond of  abusing "social-psychology-speak" and introduce too many pseudo-scientific terms without real necessity: it looks like they try artificially inflate both themselves and the subject by immersing trivial notions in obscure jargon. This infatuation with jargon, on the level completely unacceptable for the introductory course is one of the worst features of the book. It especially evident are summaries which are the Achilles spot of the book: badly written, badly thought-out, somewhat detached from the chapters content, horribly structured and weakly typeset.   The other problem with this book as an introductory (101 type) book is that it is just too big. Story-telling approach that authors use is not bad per se, but inability of authors to distinguish between really important and entertaining psycho-trivia distracts the reader. Their recently introduced multi-cultural approach adds to political correctness, but also adds to the volume.   If you are a student it is very difficult textbook to learn from. It provides an ample opportunity for a professor to create a test consisting of dozens of  hair-splitting terminology abusing questions.  You can never be sure that the detail you missed is really unimportant. You need to memorize all definitions and most of the experiments mentioned it the chapter (you might benefit from creating a Rolodeck of experiments mentioned in the book) and using the website tests to prepare. Please note that sample tests provided on website can be perfect for killing any further interest in social psychology in probably 80% of students :-)   I would like to reiterate it again that the main weakness of the book is the author inability to distinguish between really important material and trivial or supplementary material as well as almost complete absence of connections between chapters. Actually chapters can be read in a random order. There are many descriptions of both good and petty/questionable experiments without authors distinguishing between a few critical, ground-braking experiments and regular mass of  pseudo-psychological junk experiments.   Absence of CD with summaries and self-tests in inexcusable for a book with such a price, but the website is not bad (if you can find it ;-)   Typesetting of the book is weak and reflects authors complete absence of attention to structuring the material in a way that helps learners. The good thing is that definitions are put on the margins; the bad thing is that is some chapters (for example Ch 5) there just  too many definitions. Typesetting of summaries is just horrible: huge solid blocks of text with few bold typeface word/sentences.   Although I am not a professional in the field, my impression is that for self-study there are better books, both more interesting and better organized. From a few that I browsed John Sabini's textbook looks like a better deal: more interesting contents with higher dose of relevant to student's life staff. Douglas T. Kenrick textbook contains CD and looks better structured.  
 Petra Haden, OK I thought this would be some polite folk jazz record to break her into the biz, but this is just a PoP record!! It sounds like any female alternative singers CD, and is in the field of mood music. I know Bill Frisell likes to break the rules, and some say "what rules", but why does he not play -Free music, Drum n Bass, contemporary classical music- enc? Bill is a talented musician, but this is less than a bright moment. 
 Thank god I got this from the library and didn't buy it.  It's terrible.  And the ending is so abrupt I turned the next page expecting to read more and was shocked that the book was over.  The sex is icky and there's little else in the book 
 Sewn into the hem of an eighteenth-century cloak stored away in a museum, curators in the early twenty-first century discover twelve pages of handwritten notes, in code. When eventually deciphered these pages seem to indicate that shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin paid an unemployed dock worker a sum of money to murder, thereby silence, the lowly-born woman who had given birth to Franklin's illegitimate son William. The notes are apparently the minutes kept at a sort of judicial hearing attended in secret by Washington, Hamilton, Adams, and Madison, in order that the question of Franklin's guilt or innocence, and what to do about the accusation, be decided. Are the pages a modern forgery, an eighteenth-century hoax, or did one of the most beloved Founding Fathers truly spill blood to preserve his reputation? I wish I knew. After finishing this novel, I still don't. Lehrer wastes his first eighty pages on flimsy character building, then it's true he finds his stride for about the next hundred, but the trouble is, I'll tell you now, the ending is one of those variety that makes your head hit the table, because it's so frustrating. Books that fail to answer questions are rudely-composed. Why write what you don't finish? 
 It definitely seems to be more religious than I expected. Although I only browsed though it, I thought there were going to be more recurring themes regarding reincarnation, children relating stories of having been here before,or knowing things beyond their circumstances. It does have some sweet stories and is nicely laid out for the reader. I got a bit choked up reading a couple of the stories 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 This movie provides ample proof that LSD usage does affect the minds of the unborn. Grateful Dead legend Jerry Garcia's daughter made this amateurish home video. While the topic of genetically modified foods is interesting, this video comes off as terribly one-sided hatchet job on the biotech industry and U.S. agriculture, in general. Monsanto is the main target of this film's attacks, but no one from the company is ever allowed to respond to the claims that it is trying to monopolize the pesticide and seed industries by buying up potential competitors and registering for patents on thousands of genetically engineered plant products. Instead, we're treated to the overzealous opinions of a few blowhards who don't have any idea of how to encourage research, development, and innovation in agriculture. The vague term of "biodiversity" is mentioned as some kind of virtue, but no explains its benefits. Actually, everyone is allowed to whine in this movie, from farmers to activists, but no one is ever allowed to respond to attacks. In one sequence, a farmer criticizes Monsanto. In another sequence, the U.S. government is criticized for subsidizing farmers (nevermind that every major industrial power subsidizes its farmers). Why not ask the farmer if he's dependent on government handouts, and how he justifies such subsidies? Why should farmers be immune to criticism? Please, let's get into the mix a little bit, and get to the bottom of these controveries! 
 I am enraged!!! With all the great bands out there whose music is unavailable on CD, and there are 3 CDs of drek unloaded by this wanna-be variety show loser pile o'poop on this website. There is no justice in the world. While great psych and progressive rarities, highly talented rock bands of the 70's and 80's, and great albums of recent vintage that are sadly out of print languish in dank record company vaults, you can get not one, not two, but three CDs filled with the tackiest, most meaningless, crap ever released by a record label?!?!?!? AAaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I cannot think of one group I'd rather NOT listen to more than these guys. They even LOOK boring. But this music is too bad to be boring, and they have sentenced themselves to endless purgatory by releasing what has to the most tasteless, weirdest and vilest version of Chuck Berry song ever with Hail Hail.....and that one of the "members" calls herself Taffy should tell anyone all they need to know without removing that shiny silver disc from it's plastic tray. To anyone who may find themselves in possession of a Starland Vocal Band disc, do everyone who may be in earshot a favor, leave it wrapped in it's shrink, toss into a garage can and run away. You'll thank yourself in the morning. -10 stars. Truly wretched!!! 
 You can find most of these DVDs in one fell swoop on e-bay already if you use the search term "DVD lot" and you will end up paying about half the total cost. These are all Warner Bros snapcase DVDs, by the way. Yep, they come in those cases that drive everyone insane because they are cheap beyond a reasonable doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if half these titles are updated by Warner with new 2-disc special editions (in awesome packaging) in the next 2 years or so. Shop around, folks. These are the same movies you see countless times at your local pawn shop for half the cost here. There's nothing special here to be had, and chances are, you'll be paying for at least one title you don't want 
 This is a feel good book attempting to make an argument that people in business can be "professionals." By definition, business people exist to create and manage a business entity inorder to generate a profit. Professionals are licensed individuals. They are mandated by law is to protect the public's health, safety and welfare through the services that they provide to the community. This book is an attempt to corrupt and diminish the definition of professionalism.  
 Text aside, Susan Jeffer's book on Chief Seattle has inaccurate illustrations of historic Northwest Coast tribal costume, dwellings and landscape.  I also use this book with my third graders every year - but only to show the kids how some authors have not done adequate research before publishing.   There are other great children's books on the subject from lesser known authors and smaller publishers.  It may be worth your while to look them up 
   	  Like a few others, I'm commenting on your comments. WHY does ANN COULTER produce a LUKEWARM response by you all? Many reviews are approved )or disapproved) by a slim margin -- one third to one half. Hardly ANY reviews of her books (i've looked at others)are either universally liked or disliked. What gives? NOTE i've skimmed two of her books, because I'm so soft headed that I actually think I can learn from my opponents. I give her two stars for chutzpah. (Somebody explain to her what chutzpah is.) In constrast, read the amazon.com reviews of Frank Rich's "The Greatest Story ever Sold," which seems to make the usual liberal attempt to be fair and somewhat respectful of his opponents. Most of the reviews of his book are overwhelmingly approved or disapproved by 5 to 1 or 10 to 1. Ann Coulter produces lukewarm responses. Frank Rich provokes fervid love or hate. Can somebody explain this for me?????? 
 amazon sells a one year subscription for $14 which includes a $5 amazon certificate that you get later.  in the actual magazine, the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $10.00  so use the card, save some money and also dont have to wait for your $5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $5 certificate on. 
 This is not made in France -- most of the Le Creuset line is from a centuries-old factory in France; this pot is not.  When I saw where it was made, I returned it.  Buyer beware 
 I read it because some people recommended it to me as "the father of travel writing". However, it's not been a page-turner to me.. 
 It's tempting to start this review by saying sociologists should stay away from musical topics, at least if they can't appreciate music, and I mean *appreciate* rather than "enjoy." But maybe a fairer criticism would be if you're going to upset the apple cart this much, you'd really better have a sturdier theory than Tina DeNora has here. DeNora is a sociologist at the University of Exeter, and she thinks Beethoven's genius was constructed by society. She says Beethoven's place in the musical firmament was a result of certain aspiring elite aristocrats of the time having a predilection for Beethoven's "difficult" music in an attempt at social one-upmanship and wanting to use him to advance their own standing in Vienna. To put it simply, Ludwig was at the right place at the right time, he had the luck. There is no analysis of the music itself in this book, because she has decided it is irrelevant. I'm not kidding.  DeNora would likely argue that our criteria for "greatness" have been pre-determined by the very elements that we then go into a "great work" looking for. The aesthetics of criticism are a social construct, and so is the music; therefore it's no wonder the two fit together so well. Music criticism is taste writ large, that's all. (Sociology, on the other hand, is not subject to these social tastes and trends, of course.)  Actually, I felt upon approaching this book there may be something to her argument. As Michael Walsh jokingly and insightfully remarked in his book Who's Afraid of Classical Music, "Ludwig 'Rights o' Man' Beethoven was always sucking up to royalty in his dedications." It's hard to deny: he knew who buttered his bread. It's easy to view talent, especially when from the distant past, in a vacuum that we don't extend to the present. In today's world I find myself wondering, for just one example, if a fine but unremarkable actress such as Gwyneth Paltrow would be where she is were her mother not Blythe Danner and her father not a prominent TV producer who is good buddies with Steven Spielberg. Is it any coincidence that Gwyneth's first role was in a Spielberg film, Hook?   So what does DeNora say? After several chapters on the state of the aristocracy and aristocratic taste of the time--chapters I enjoyed and am not prepared to defend or debunk--she focuses relentlessly on the famous quote about Beethoven from Count Waldstein, saying he would go forth to receive the spirit of Mozart from the hands of Haydn. DeNora argues, repeatedly, (she seems to think that by repeating a groundless assertion she can make it stick) that this statement played a huge role in elevating Beethoven to greatness in the minds of the Viennese aristocracy. Of course this begs the question how did Mozart and Haydn achieve *their* reputations? Sure Beethoven understood how he could benefit socially from the patronage of Haydn--he?d have to be an idiot not to understand it--but seeing it solely on those simplistic terms ignores the fact that he was innovating, and that except for Mozart and Haydn his contemporaries were not. DeNora seems to make a big deal out of this, saying they were thrown on their own as freelancers because they lacked Beethoven's connections (while giving us no real evidence that this is in fact the reason they "went commercial" and he succeeded as a serious artist). She conveniently ignores the fact that Schubert had no significant connections, yet has also come down to us as a "great composer." Hummel's sonatas, written around the same time as Beethoven's and Schubert's, show just how far ahead of their time Beethoven and Schubert were. But this is not mentioned.  Furthermore DeNora either underplays or seems unaware of the reputation of Mozart, of how his music was also considered extraordinarily difficult well into the 19th century. Beethoven himself singled out the fifth "Haydn" quartet of Mozart and said that in this work Mozart was showing to the world what he could do if only they were ready for it. Of course, some of Beethoven's patrons had also been Mozart's, but this shows the idea of serious music did not begin with Beethoven, and this makes her thesis about changing tastes in the aristocracy weaker.  But DeNora's argument spectacularly self-destructs on page 119, in one of the most amazingly inept chapters of any book I've ever read. She describes the first time pianist Gelinek competed with a young Beethoven in a duel in 1793. Gelinek expressed confidence he would destroy Beethoven--make mincemeat of him by one account. The next day the father of the person telling the tale asks Gelinek how he did and the pianist admitted he was the one pulverized. Keep in mind he did not know of Beethoven or his reputation before the duel. You'd think DeNora would see this as a strike against her thesis, but she actually says (p. 121): "First, whatever Galinek thought of Beethoven is less relevant in this context [!!] than the ways his conversations were converted subsequently into topics in their own right--material for further discussion within the music world." Never mind that this person who never heard Beethoven before and was unaware of his reputation, by DeNora's own admission, was blown away and humbled, what matters is how the result elevated Beethoven's position. It never occurs to her that perhaps it elevated his position because it was deserved! But she doesn't stop there: "Once again, we see that Beethoven's reputation *can be conceived of as the accumulation of a repertoire of recorded, publicized stories about his talent.* [emphasis mine, out of disbelief] She goes on: "In telling the story of Beethoven's talent, Gelinek positioned himself as subordinate to Beethoven (as a less talented but admiring colleague); thus Galinek testified to and helped to publicize a favorable view of Beethoven's talent by aligning his own abilities as inferior to Beethoven's." What is one to make of this idiocy that passes for sociology? DeNora never for a moment considers that perhaps Gelinek simply believed what he said. I think it's obvious she reached her conclusion before she began and worked backwards, determined to cram every fact she uncovered into her theory even if she had to pound the loose ends down with a sledgehammer.  Musicologist and pianist Charles Rosen, in a rebuttal shortly after the DeNora book was published, commented that an ethnomusicologist once told him there surely must be hundreds of "Eroica" symphonies that we just don't know about, written by unknown geniuses galore. As Rosen points out, we do indeed know many if not most of the works of Beethoven's contemporaries; many have been analyzed, revived and recorded. They do not come close to Beethoven in originality, breadth of thought, or structural sophistication. But DeNora, like so many revisionists with an agenda, loses her finely-honed sense of skepticism when dealing with alternative interpretations to events. Then she really tips her hand: "While these programs [of cannonic revisionism] obviously vary in levels of ambition, they share a concern with the ways exclusive or ?high? cultural forms are both inaccessible and inappropriate to the lived experience of a large proportion of the people to whom they are upheld as inspirational."  That astonishing remark could be interpreted in ways ranging from merely patronizing to racist, and it sets DeNora up as a sort of cultural arbiter herself. *Inappropriate?* Says whom? Inappropriate to whom? And why?   After all this, there is still one remaining gripe, and that is DeNora?s writing style. It is repetitious in the extreme. She really has a thin point, and takes well over 200 pages to make it. This book could have been a magazine article or two- or three-part series in a journal. Trash 
 This book was not a study guide, as advertised.  It is simply a compilation of tests and test answer keys without any explanations.  I am sending it back to Amazon.co 
 I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER. It works great and keeps my hair luscious. The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair. I don't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.  This is one of their better scents, however.  I would recommend using this as a body wash only 
 does anyone know the title or artist or both of the song that was playing in the background when wil approached eva in the club?  sounds like "everything but the girl" but i'm not sure.  the soundtrack doesn't have it...help!  thank 
 I bought this book instead of some of the other "How to Knit" books because I could see this book getting me beyond the basics.  The problem is that this book very poorly explains the basics.  I ended up googling "How To Knit" to figure out what I was doing and became much less confused.  Part of my problem is that I feel like many of the steps to get from skein to scarf are left out, because I'm always asking myself "But what about __."  I'm sure that when I become more mastered in the art of knitting I will open this book again. I also agree with another reviewer-this book is very poorly organized. 
 Actually I have not read this book and probably won't anytime soon.  I understand there is more than one side to everything but am totally offened at the response to Dr. Barach from ISSD.  The organization helped me tremdously when I first found out I had MPD/DID.  I could not find Dr. Barach's response anywhere on here but I would think that in defending the organization the Dr. is also defending those of us who have a legitimate diagnosis of MPD/DID 
 Can't add much to the discussion about the movie, but wanted to say that this DVD listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of School Daze. It says it has both full screen and widescreen, but it doesnt 
 One of the most confusing things about logic and reason is that it all necessarily depends on what you mean by the words you use, which is to say... it all depends.   I note for example, in the introductory chaper, page 1, "Overgeneralization", there are a couple major overgeneralizations.  That's why they needed to invent math and science, where nothing is real except precise definitions, and logic works wonderfully.  Using reason with actual real things takes more than logic 
 The information that is in this book is good but it is way overpriced.  I could get the same amount of information in anthor book for 30 dollars cheaper 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?  I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.  But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.  Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?  I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.  by Tom Knapp, Rambles edito 
 The book has beautiful pictures, but that is it.  The book was written for someone living in the UK, so if you do, you might like this book.  The descriptions of each of the rides and attractions were vague and basically  useless.  If you want an excellent book on Orlando, spend you money on the  Unoffical Guide or the Econoguide books.  Those are worth their weight in  gold 
 more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc 
 he gets 2 for 2 good songs in the whole cd!this cd blows 
 My two year olds dont even like this toy.  They love the wiggles, they do point to the characters and say their names - but to PLAY on it.  Not possible.  The songs mumble jumble all over each other as the kids move on the matt.  Its a very loud speaker and even I cannot take it (Im very liberal w/ loud toys and banging, etc)  There is not an ounce of fun in this toy, im very disappointed as most of the other wiggles toys have been great.     Dont spend your money on this one.  OR keep your receipt handy.  
 This book was the text for the analog filters class at my university. There are numerous errors in the book, and the presentation of the material is confusing. I hope that an errant sheet could accompany the book. Also, the back cover states that Matlab is employed to minimize algebraic and other computational needs. Where is it employed???? Not in this edition!!!! 
 I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles. 
 Overall I found this guide pretty confusing, but I guess it is better than nothing.  There are better choices, and some may want to consider auto-formatting software such as Eazypaper and others.  
 Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country. For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be 
 With the exception of some pages that have been added in the back on braided rope this book is horribly outdated.  The newer section is just reprints from Sampson rope splices which are available on the web.  Unless you are restoring an old square masted sailing craft don't bother 
 Having recently graduated with a BA in English, I am forever doomed to read such so-called "truth texts" with what could only be called an eye for detail; does the author site her sources?  Credentials?  Any sort of solid evidence as to why I, as her reader, should believe a word of what she says? The answer is, simply, no. Ms. Cumbey quotes other texts by other zealotous fundamentalists, to be sure.  However, the credentials of these people remain a mystery.  Anyone can write a book, and anyone with enough money can get it published.  Had I the funds, I could write a "revealing, riveting best seller" on the nature of human genomes and cloning and my opinions of the matter; throw in a few quotes by people who may or may not sound like they know what they're talking about, and there you go.  The point is, my knowledge of such topics is sorely limited, as is Ms. Cumbey's research.  Yet somehow a book that would never earn a passing grade in a collegiate literature course for lack of research and depth of understanding is littering our shelves.  Well, I'm baffled 
 Although this books dives into the area of color to say that you are a summer, winter, spring, makes absolutely no sense.  A summer where?  Ireland?  Africa?  Thailand? Dallas?  Summer is different in each of these places so this theory simply doesn't add up.  In addition, not all blonde hair blue eyed women fall into the same category.  Nor do brunettes. What this book does is ease the pain of actually having to diagnose a person to their own unique color characteristics.  By telling you that you are this or that you are templated into the category of being something less than what you are.  What would you be called if you can wear pink and orange?  Is there such a thing as slightly warm or a spring/winter? Through this and most theories similiar, people are missing out on colors that truly enhance their overall appearance. If you want to know your "colors" find a reputable image consultant who understands more than how to make a template.  Find one that will give you fabric swatches and explain why you can be more than one season.  Find a professional who understands the true meaning of making your colors unique to you without the template. Don't waste time being templated into the rest of what society believes is true because no one person has the same exact coloring as the next. Most professionals will tell you this.  Take their word for it 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 Anybody that has spent anytime around boats would know 90% of the information covered in this book.  At least it is a quick read so not much time is wasted on it.  It would probably be helpful for someone who has never been on a boat but, has plans to move aboard in less than a week 
 I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the "burger" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry...  
 I checked out this book from the library for a history project, but I found the information and analysis in this book too biased for use on a research paper. This book is an attack on the Clinton administration and communism, not a history book. The book fails to incorporate the current domestic and global conditions in China, and rely too heavily on common beliefs of the "evils" of the communist theory. Of course, history has proven that communism is bad, but he fails to understand, there is a reason why the government in China is still in place today. The author fails to understand the thinking, history, and cultures of the Chinese. In his suggestions of how the United States should act against China, the author makes a clear statement that the ends justify the means, and indirectly states that it's okay for the United States to be immoral to eliminate any competition. In a world where people constantly criticizes our arrogance and ignorance, his suggestions confirms the criticisms about how we believe we are the best, and everyone should follow our example without a true understanding of the situation.  Ironically, we are the country that emphasizes diversity, but we are also the country who forces others to be just like us even though our model might not fit for their country 
 This book is so full of errors that they are too many to list here. It really is a very bad source on Ireland that anyone who has any knowledge on Ireland would spot how bad it is.  This is unfortunatley the type of book that gets publicity but is actually quite uninformed.  If you want genuine information on Ireland and Irish culture I recommend that you go elsewhere.  
 I purchased this item Jan 2006.  It has already quit recognizing any of the items plugged into it.  My USB printer went beserk when I plugged it in - never could get a page to print, so I direct connected into my laptop and all was fine. Now my camera dock and PDA are not recognized. I have contacted the warranty people via email - told me to call. Contacted Belkin and they gave me an RMA # to return the item 
 It is imbecilic people like Michael Ledeen who contribute to the current U.S. foreign policy which separates the "good" countries and the "terrorists." It is common knowledge that the U.S. has a habit of supporting dictatorships, terrorist movements & groups throughout its history. Yet, the U.S. and people like Ledeen have the gall to declare a battle of "good vs. evil." Simply, the U.S. will support a regime whether it sponsors terrorism or not, if it so suits their interests. You have the Central Asian republics for example, Central American in the '80s, Saddam & Taliban in the '80's, Israel now, the list goes on and on. So, this "war" against the "terror masters," is a way the U.S. gov't can fool the American people into bloated military expansionism, imperialism, and a militant unilateralism that will ultimately cause its own demise. And, sorry to be the bearer of bad news but  the U.S. will NOT win for among other things, peak oil & the decline of the dollar will bring down the U.S. economy and hence military-industrialist complex very soon. In fact, the process has already begun with the Iraq war. The U.S. is no exception to the rises and falls of empires of the past, and in fact the collapse will be proportional to its size 
 The overwhelming impression one gets when reading Pat Yale's contributions to this book are that here we have a woman who, due to her own ill-founded preconceptions, has almost completely failed to understand and appreciate the beauty of the culture into which she finds herself immersed. As a result, her comments regarding Iranian culture come across as being crude and disrespectful, often obnoxious, and even downright racist. Perhaps as a Westerner she cannot help being the way she is, but if that is the case, what on earth is she doing going to Iran in the first place, and what kind of an authority is she to write a travel guide?  For example, in the section on p.51 entitled "The Iranian Way of Life", we are forced, amongst other things, to put up with the unnecessary snide comment, "It's a rare husband... who would as much as carry a dirty dish to the sink, let alone do any housework" - now would this not just as aptly describe a typical British or American husband (perhaps even her own?), who would rather spend his evenings down the local pub with his mates - and who will later urinate on someone's wall on the way home, while singing loudly and hurling abuse at innocent passers-by? And then there are the ridiculous comments about rising divorce rates - which the author idiotically puts down to the existence of arranged marriages, failing completely to realise that the divorce rates in countries where arranged marriages are prevalent are MUCH lower than in the West where pre-marital sexual promiscuity is taken for granted. If she had half a brain, she would have reached exactly the opposite conclusion - that it is the gradual Westernisation of Iran that was leading to the increase in divorce rates (which is presumably one of the many reasons that they would rather do without the rapidly spreading disease of Westernisation - and if the satellite TV propaganda machine fails, there are always the bombs, eh?). And the section ends with the stereotypical and spitefully Islamophobic comment, "These days it's a rare man who can afford to take up his Islamic right to have four wives".  And she does rant on and on about the oppressive hijab that she has been forced to wear, and the segregation between men and women. Sadly for her, the author does not appreciate the beauty of a society in which modesty and piety are valued so greatly. Rather, the author (deducing that all Iranian men must be sexually repressed) expresses her surprise at not having been fondled! She did in passing mention the fact that she was treated with great dignity as a lone woman while queing for her visa extension, but apparently failed to see past her veil enough to realise that this elevated respect for women permeates the whole of Islamic culture. And she would do well to note that it is precisely this modesty  which makes arranged marriages work so well (in complete contradistinction to the misguided promiscuity and sexual freedom in the West, which effectively renders marriage meaningless and leads them to fail).  So the result is a book which is technically sound and reasonably comprehensive, interspersed with the most ourageous Islamophobic/Iranophobic Western hate propaganda - an irritating and unusual combination which leaves you wanting to kick [...] Perfect then, for your stereotypical FOX-News/CNN-educated American tourist, who probably should never have been let out of the country in the first place.  Until something better comes along (perhaps a new edition completely rewritten by someone who actually ENJOYS being in Iran and APPRECIATES its culture), then unfortunately this otherwise dubious piece of hate-literature remains a useful guide.  [If the spiteful comments get too much, simply striking through the offending paragraphs/pages with a thick black marker pen may help] 
 I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.  This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war 
 After watching the movie which I enjoyed.  I bought the book thinking it would be just as good if not better.  Boy was I wrong, the book was horrible.  I could barely finish reading it.  This is one case where the movie is much better than the book 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.  Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it 
 I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd 
 This was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen -- and I LOVE college movies!  The acting was horrible and the plot was dumb and simply a rip-off of other movies.  It simply wasn't funny, and the gross-out jokes really pushed the limit -- anybody's limit!  The lead actor does a HORRIBLE impression of Chevy Chase during the whole movie -- go rent Fletch if you want to watch a quality movie with that type of character.  And, most laughably of all, one of the main characters is Teck, from the Real World on MTV!  He's not an actor, he's just a reality tv nobody, so what the heck is he doing in this movie?  This movie went straight to video for a reason, so avoid it at all costs 
 If ever there was a rallying cry for abortion this film should be it. Survivor from Freddy's last bloodbath Alice (Lisa Wilcox) is the recipient of his demon seed. Freddy thus gains control over the fetus' dreams and ergo control over Alice. But instead of taking the logical way out Alice insists on keeping the baby ("Grab your crucifix") and in the process provides the fuel the story needs to power through another useless sequel. At one point one character, Mark, even thinks and then recommends that she terminate the pregnancy which she rejects outright. Mark just rolls over, like he was the father to be or something, and says "OK we'll just find another way." What a lark! What follows is a battle for the heart and mind of the not yet born Jacob. Just think of it as a "Rosemary's Baby" for a younger, simpler generation.   The main problem this franchise faced at this point was that they felt every kill had to somehow be more awesome than the last. Early on there is a head-scratcher of a scene where Dan is turned into an actual Ghost Rider. And since they are tied to this idea that every kill has to supersede the previous one you begin to realize that this exercise in extreme silliness is only working against the films. They have become so far removed from reality that you can no longer take them seriously. I would argue that good ol' Freddy jumped the shark a few films back, but as I watched this one I just had this image of his jumping sharks, one after another, in hopes that he could possibly destroy the legacy of even the first film. That said this one is a minor step up from "Nightmare on Elm Street 4." Here they dig into Freddy's very past past and find out that he was the product of a rape that occurred at an insane asylum. Since Freddy has been messing with Alice's baby she enlists the help of his mother in hopes of reigning in the deranged serial killer. The whole thing has a very Jerry Springer-ish smell to it. Since "Nightmare on Elm Street 3" the formula has been about the same and they follow it here as well. Hero has friends who don't believe in Freddy. Said friends have token hobby (here diving and comic books). Freddy kills all of hero's friends using their hobby against them. Hero beats up Freddy. The parents haven't gotten any smarter with time, but here their role is less pivotal. In this one there is a scene where the first thing out of Alice's father's mouth after her boyfriend has died is him blaming her boyfriend for his own death. Classy. The focus has shifted away from the idiocy of the parents and more on creating a nonsensical world for Freddy to frolic in. The only rule in this game is that Freddy is all powerful. My friend, who insisted that I watch the entire series, claims this one to be his favorite. I blame it on the fact that he is a comic book geek and thus represented here. . .although I'm sure he would deny that connection. To me this is the second weakest with the original remaining the only one I can actually recommend. Freddy was running in circles and sucking wind by this point. At least Jason had the good sense to eventually move his freak show into space. **1/2 
 i am an honestly big fan of beyonce. i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny's child. i even love her new song "beautiful liar". but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album, escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album "Bday" because her birthday is in september. but still, i can't help but love her new song. and i think that she did a great job with shakira. it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade, which makes it a great song. but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice. i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album 
 Nice looking skates, but very stiff boot and runs too small. Don't like the stiffness of the boot. Will not buy another RD product 
 I am one of the Vietnam veterans referred to on page 217, the ones that didn't agree with anything the VVAW had to say.Someone wrote in their revue " the myth of civilian disrespect to the soldiers during this period of time", I would have to say it felt quite real to me. The only reason I checked this book out of my local library was to confirm a couple of things about John Kerry and the VVAW. All my questions were answered either by the book or by a recent interview with Gerald Nicosia. The first was that the other members of VVAW felt that John Kerry was just using the organization to gain public notoriety to help him with his political career. The second was that he was at the november 1971 meeting. This is when the anti war VVAW considered assassination of pro war Senators. Simply amazing 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 This gun broke in the first few used.   When I called for service, they inisted on waiting for the tech, and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun  cost.  Overall...  this was a writeoff 
 I bought this book hoping to learn more about Islam. But as I started to read the book it was more of a -how to convert your Muslim friends to Christianity- book. I am not interested in converting Muslims to Christianity, but if you are, this book would be helpful. It helps to show the similarities between the two religions, but talks about showing Muslims the way of Christ and the Bible more than it does explain Islam. The info on this book should have been more specific on what it was about 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures.   The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)  This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinio 
 The characters in this book are forever taking showers.  When they're not taking showers, they are either planning to take a shower, wishing they could take a shower, or telling each other to take a shower.    Why in the world does she make the main character, Kate, a scant *29* years old??  It's ridiculous.  Not only does she have an MD, she has at least one PhD.  And she has managed to reach the top of her field by 29.  But wait, there's more!  She also, during all this achievement, managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of TWENTY, and then raise it.  Uh huh.  Why does Johansen not just make Kate 39, and be a bit more realistic on all counts?  There is a hint early on when Kate muses that Benny, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, is only 23, which makes her so much more attractive than elderly Kate.  ARGH! Clearly, Johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of 39.  *snore*  How ridiculous 
 Five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value.    Value???  At around $135 this box set to mark Tony Bennett's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan / collector, rather than at the casual buyer.  With that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that Sony/Columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special?  What we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag.  Firstly, the packaging.    The picture on Amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set, as the finished product is more elaborate.  The box is a cube covered in black velour with Bennett's signature embossed into the top.  The front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer.  Behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos, set slightly back from the panel to give a 3D effect.  Above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with Bennett's signature.    In the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small, hard backed book of approximately 60 pages, again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer's signature.  Contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief (and I do mean brief) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set.  All very nice, but as a fan of the music I would have prefered recording information, anectdotes about the original album releases, session details, etc.      At approximately 7.5" x 7.5" x 7.5", the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your CDs.  OK - so what about what we really came here for, namely, the music?  This is where the above mentioned frustration comes in.  Let's take it album by album.  First of all there are several already available CDs, but in digitally remastered form, some with and some without bonus tracks.  These are:  I Left My Heart In San Francisco - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   The Art of Excellence - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   Perfectly Frank - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   MTV Unplugged - Two bonus cuts ("Just a Little Street Where Old Friends Meet" / "When Will the Bells Ring for Me?") and  slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  The Movie Songs - Two bonus cuts ("A Time for Love" / "The Shining Sea") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  Then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of "pointless" as they have already been available for some time, already previously remastered:  Cloud Seven - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Beat of My Heart - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  If I Ruled the World: Songs for the Jet Set - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album - An even more puzzling inclusion.  Not a Columbia release, but recorded for the Fantasy label in the '70s.  This is the original Fantasy CD release, not even repackaged for the box set by Columbia.  It's just as if they bought a bunch of these from Fantasy and popped them into this collection.  However, and again frustratingly, this is NOT the 20 Bit remastered edition of this CD that has been available for several years but the non-remastered, sonically inferior release from the late '90s.  Perhaps Fantasy had a few thousand of these that they couldn't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on Sony/Columbia?  Whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set, to say the least.  Next is one album already previously released and remastered, but here in a slightly amended form.  I Wanna Be Around - No noticeable difference in sound quality, but with different bonus cuts from the previous release.  The previous CD release of this album included as a bonus, seven tracks from the "This Is All I Ask" album, a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition, as all of the  tracks from "This Is All I Ask" would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release.  For the box set release we have three different bonus tracks "If I Love Again" (alternate take) / "Someone To Love" (alternate take) / "Indian Summer".  So - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your (now deleted) previous CD release of this album.  The next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless:  The Singles Collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan and not the casual buyer (casual buyers don't drop $135 on a whim), another "Greatest Hits" variant is completely pointless.  Something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc, probably several times over.  Heaven forbid Sony/Columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this, their umpteenth hits compilation.   Finally, two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans.  Tony Bennett Sings for Two - Briefly available on CD many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason.  This remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release.  When Lights are Low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on CD (so far as I can ascertain).  An absolute gem.  More of this type of album -i.e. never before available on CD- is what this collection needed.  So - what do we have at the end of the day for the Bennett faithful?  One previously unavaiable on CD release and one long unavailable on CD album,  three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in,  one album in an inferior version to what is already available, one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release, five albums with remastered sound (two with bonus cuts) and, finally, one totally pointless "hits" collection.    Considering that approximately thirty Tony Bennett albums have never had a CD release, many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults, this collection is a completely botched undertaking, a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man's 80th birthday.  Just exactly who executive producer Danny Bennett and Sony/Columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery.  If it is the dedicated fan, then I have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums, a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $135.  Just what are the chances, I wonder, of Tony Bennett's back catalogue making it to CD before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves?   This is a sorry monument to a great artist's 80th year.  (AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set, namely, thirteen.  Not a dozen, not twenty. but thirteen.  Go figure.  You know what they say about the number 13 - "...unlucky for some...".  In this case the unlucky ones are Mr Bennett's fans.)                  
 I read all of the great reviews that this product had, but I encountered nothing but problems.  First, the pieces it came with did not fit my tank.  The short attachment was too short and the long attachment was way too long so I had to cut it.  The pump is not strong enough to pull the water up through the attachment no matter how much I cut it and even with it off, the pump had major problems.  The product just did not perform as the manufacturer or other customers had testified to.  It was way loud and kept up my kids atnight who slept in the next room.  I was not impressed and changed back to the free filter that came with the tank - the Tetra Whisper brand 
 A quick note to counterbalance all of the glowing reviews.  Of course, everybody has an opinion, and one can't argue with taste as they say, so let me provide - for your consideration - a representative passage from the first few pages of this translation.  From the second page of "St. John's Eve": "I remember like now - the old woman, my late mother, was still alive - how on a long winter's evening, when there was a biting frost outside that walled us up solidly behind the narrow window of our cottage, she used to sit by the comb, pulling the long thread out with her hand, rocking the cradle with her foot, and humming a song that I can hear as if it was (sic) now."  I don't speak Russian, and maybe this "I remember like now" expression represents a literal translation of some Russian idiom, but it would have made a lot more sense to translate the phrase into something along the lines of "I remember as if it were yesterday" - a corny expression, but one that at least makes sense in English.  If this seems like a petty criticism, take into account that that kind of awkward, bizarre phrasing is repeated in just about every other sentence.  The translators are fond of corny, archaic words like "mug" (for face) and "drubbing" that seem like they belong in a British translation from the 30s, not something copyrighted in 1998.  I just wanted to give a warning to anyone who was actually expecting this to be a "modern" translation, i.e., a translation into something resembling contemporary English.  For the record, "Dead Souls" is one of my favorite novels and "Ivan Ivanovich / Ivan Nikiforovich" one of my favorite short stories, so this isn't about disliking Gogol 
 this movie sucks. ending is predictable. the line about being as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton was ALMOST good. Reservoir Dogs--now there's a heist film 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 Dow Jones is still going through its major corrections after the roaring 80s and then the 90s. We are experiencing the same cylical phase that happened in the 70s - when war, energy crises, international market expansions, and demographic changes were gradually driving the economy to a malaise.  The main difference is that the country was in little debt 30 years ago. We are now owing other countries trillions of dollars, and the trade deficit will continue to soar. The economy may sink as a result, but it has nothing to do with bubble bursting. That was already done in the stock market years ago. Should the economy finally collapse, it will have to do with our structural economic problems.   Most probably prefer a soft-landing rather than a hard collapse. It will take some sacrifice and some political leadership to achieve a peaceful and endurable transition. It will be about our committment to paying down the debt, ending our oil dependence, and educating the workforce to take on the jobs of the new century that are not to be "outsourced" to other places.   As this review is being written, the alleged "greater bubble" has yet to be materialized. However, stocks will NOT emerge into a greater bubble unless the American people can become optimistic about the economy again. Dent has been wrong in his past predictions, so please do not take this book too seriously either 
 Lasted less than a year. 
 I own all of these movies already and I can honestly tell you this collection is a rip off. They're asking way too much for so few movies. Now, you add a few more classics and make them all 2-disc special editions, then hell yeah I'll pay $500 for it. But this just isn't worth it, collection set or not 
 Let's be honest here, this IS a rip-off. After all the cut and paste done by the editors, one would expect a proper show to begin, preferably with some unseen material, then it ends briefly in the middle of a huh! moment. The marketing and packaging was good cos those who bought it, like me, thought it was another obscure, raw and previously unrealesed material by Mr RP the genius. It does this great man a HUGE disservice, may he rest in peace. For someone who got a standing ovation as he entered heaven, this dvd does not do him good 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 This book is utter crap. If you want to go back back to the dark ages, you'll love it. If you believe in science, biology, diversity, and human progress, read Dr. Kinsey's real work and leave this attack from the religious right where it belongs - on the dung heap 
 I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful.  The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense.  Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and "blame the white man" views.  I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger.  Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this 
 okay i've been trained both in sociology and philosophy and would say the book brings the poorest of both worlds.. never believed in intellectual history in general, but this kind of book, with its judgements about Kierkeggardian or Wittgensteinian 'individualism' as a 'natural pathology' of early twentieth century continental bourgeoise society, does nothing but buttress the self-complacency of our now liberal societies. Therefore despite some 'interesting' anectodes and impressions from Habsburg Vienna, the philosophical depth of the book doesnt go above our usual journalistic wisdom. I dont understand how other reviewers found this book brilliant or anything like that. I think recommendable as passtime only 
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 After reading some of Connie Willis' other books, I must say that this book was very disappointing to me.  After finishing this book it didn't even enter my mind once like Doomsday Book and Bellwether did.  It was very confusing and it didn't seem like the plot was going anywhere.  Like another reviewer said, I didn't know that Fin was female until almost the end of the book.  The reason that this isn't just one star is that the book was funny, especially the character Bult so I could enjoy the book a little bit 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS has been promoted as a "gripping legal thriller" but I didn't find it particularly gripping or thrilling.   I ultimately found this novel to be a rather slow-moving experience.  The main character, middle-aged lawyer Michael Seeley, is not particular likable or well developed.  Despite his enormous financial success, Seeley spends a lot of time in this novel pitying himself and engaging in a variety of self-destructive and unprofessional behavior.   I found him a tough character to root for.  The plot moves slowly and mainly consists of a series of dialogues between Seeley and a host of supporting characters.  Much of this dialogue is stilted and ponderous.  This is the type of book where characters give speeches instead of having real-life conversations.  Some of the subject matter of this novel is interesting, but it is not served well by the dialogue.  I also found the storyline of this novel to be remarkably convoluted and largely rooted in the past.  I was hoping for a more realistic and topical plot, given Goldstein's background as a prominent copyright and IP attorney.  That didn't happen here.    In short, I found this book rather disappointing.  It's a decently written novel that explores some interesting issues, but the plot and characterization falls short.  I also found the ending rather limp and unsatisfying.  For a debut legal thriller that's much better than this one, I would recommend John Hart's KING OF LIES.  
 Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book.  "Creating Meaning in Your Life..." is not what this book is about.  There is lots of talk about  how important it is to have purpose in your life, but little about how to  create it.  Mr. Leider has a great reputation -- it must have come from his  other books 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 I think the book really is about project management, not programme management.  As a project manager professional I have read numerous project management books and to be honest, I have not learned anything new in this book.  I was looking for a book that would provide a programme manager (former project manager that masters project management techniques) tools & techniques to help with managing a project portfolio.  Furthermore, I found the book to be somehow expensive vs content 
 The only reason why I am NOT buying this product, is because the description doesn't give the lengh.  How stupid...!!! I am sure I am not the only one to turn this great product down.  Come on, think a little and tell us how long it is 
  but the touch wheel is harder to use.   I bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it. Since that point time I had a harder time turning it off/pausing, adjusting the volume, using the back and forth touch points, and setting a stop point in a audiobook. This is the result of the mini being recessed into the case.  I took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again. The case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for.  Also, make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since I nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip.   I'll only use when absolutely necessary now. 
 I recieved this item in a timley manner.. I found that I believe that I have been shipped a used or returned item.. Unlike the other pan I recieved this one had obviously been opened and had the attaching parts for the handle opened with pieces missing.I am very disappointed as they clearly state that returned items would not be accepted if opened. 
 I believed that I buyed a book of history, but it isn't. From almost the first page the book is full of personal opinions and few history.  The opinions of Anna Reid are simple, the ucranians are very good and the russians very bad,three undred and fifty years together is nothing for her, and in many parts of Ucrania the russian are new occupants - from mid XIX century (sic )- !¡. I thing that California, Texas, etc,  belongs to Mexico in the opinion of Mrs Anna Reid too, they were conquered in 1848. I know a lot of history of Russia and Ucrania, but for someone don't, the book is dangerous and worst it's not true.  When I read her, that seems to me very similar to the arguments of terrorist vasques in Spain and other minorities in Europe. I hope that Mrs Anna Reid fight for the independence of Scotland with the same strenght she do for Ucrania independence.  I'm sure that Ucrania and Russia will be togheter again in the future, but books like Borderland, cause more pain that it seem at first sight.   If you look for diferences you will find everywhere, but one country is a country because there are more thing that keep united to the people that diferences.   Definitively a bad book of history.   Yours faithfully.   Francisco Martínez Alcalá ( Madrid. Spain )   
 I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one.  Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great.  It really did send goosebumps down my spine.  THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short 
 The "reader from Tarrytown, NY" is not expecting her first child in a few months.  She's an employee of Consumers Union, who happened to market the book.  She already has two small children and is not expecting anymore at the present time. It's not fair and ethical to write a review for it.  Let the book stand/fall on its own merits 
 This film has a good story, good actors and plot but it bores me to death because nothing happens between the two lovers. No kisses, no touch. nothing. 
 I guess we can thank the global population for making Rob Schneider a  leading actor by continually buying tickets to that Deuce Bigalow fiasco.  I could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn.  I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.  If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.    The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...  Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.  Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.  (2) Anna Faris...I can't decide whether I think she's really cute or if she's just a Plain Jane with large eyes...but when I'M thinking she's pretty cute, she's nice to look at.  
 This book is a major rip-off. Its title leads you to believe you'll get ideas that you can immediately put into action to generate relatively immediate sales. Allow me to quote some random examples:  #385: Focus your marketing efforts on those companies and industries that can afford to pay for your services.  #393: Market to your best bets first--those you are fairly sure will buy.  #766: Keep a map of your country and world map with time zones, zip codes, and telephone area codes.  #1189: Get it in writing.  She even includes a couple of tips on what to do if you receive a suspicious parcel -- a bomb, I presume.  The bomb is this book. Her tips are not about making more money. They're about walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's a great book for rank beginners. But she should change the title. The only reason why it gets any star at all is because Amazon won't allow us to give zero stars. I suppose she gets a star for good spelling.  
 This is the worst thing I have ever owned!!!! It broke (said there were no cd's inside) after about a week! Do yourself a favor don't get this product, don't buy this brand and don't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too 
 The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.  I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise.  TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.  I'm not sure which is more upsetting:  how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received.   
 The basis of this book is that consciousness can be explained as a Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms in the neurons.  Interesting idea, sadly impossible.  Bose-Einstein condensates can only exist at very low temperatures.  The inside of the brain certainly doesn't qualify.  The authors could've easily established the impossibility of their claim by looking up B-E condensates in any textbook on statistical mechanics 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 This printer gulps down expensive ink at an alarming rate. I printed a dozen cd's and four 5 x 7 photos and it used about 75% of the ink that came in the cartridges that came with it. The ink is pricey, nearly $14 a cartridge. Yes it prints nicely but the cost of ink is prohibitive. Avoid this printer like the plague unless you enjoy wasting money 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 Immensely popular and influential among left-wing American cultural critics, this book has been critiqued ravishly by French psychologists.  The gist of their critique is that the book represents more of the values and concerns of Foucault rather than an accurate and responsible history of mental illness.  Foucault's central argument that society defines sane and insane behavior is an old cliche in cultural anthropology.  Furthermore, recent advances in cognitive science and psychiatry challenge Foucault's position by affirming that mental illness is exactly that, namely, "an illness."  Simply stated, there is so much cross-cultural evidence that certain psychiatric disorders are univeral and not, therefore, specific to cultures but biologically grounded.  Various mental illnesses have been verified biologically as illnesses in the same way that biologically illnesses are also recognizable as physical illnesses.  Foucault is sometimes touted as a "cutting-edge" thinker, but his ideas were dated before he wrote them down.  Erving Goffman's book "Asylums" is an earlier and far better treatment of the cultural dynamics of mental institutions, and Ruth Benedict argued (in 1930) that insanity is often a cultural construct rather than a physical malady.  The basics of Foucault's ideas can also be seen in the writing of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Montaigne, and other Renaissance writers--about 400 years ago.  The moral dimensions of Foucault's fraud are only now being explored, and this writer's currently trendy reputation is not likely to stand the test of time.  This book is a good example of ways in which trendy writing and intellectual fads can quickly be discovered to be mere cliches.  Intellectual dubiousness aside, the major problems with this tome deal with Foucault's romanticization of mental illness.  In placing "insanity" in quotes, Foucault is arguing that it is one more mental condition -- no better nor worse than sanity.  This view is intellectually suspect, at best, and downright dangerous at worst.  It seems that Foucault is writing to shock and self-aggrandize his own self.  This shouldn't be surprising when even a cursory read of his biography reveals that Foucault had all sorts of loathsome predilections, including praise for Mao, Stalin, and Khomeni as well as stated opposition to age of consent laws and support for eugenics, not to mention his passionate involvement in S&M and LSD trips 
 I do not know why I bought this cd. Lousy 
 This product looked light it was one of the best made USB lights/fans out there except the light and the fan burned out after 1 month of use because of overheating 
 I originally ordered a "Ozma of Oz" book from Amazon.com and instead of getting a 'Books of Wonder Edition' (which I should've made sure to select, but luckily ordered in through Dymmocks) I got the above Thorndike Large Print edition, and that's a lousy copy.  And this is why . . .  I already had a Dover Paperback Edition of 'Ozma' and of course the pictures were in black-and-white.  When I got Thorndike's edition, it was WORSE!!  The pictures weren't just in black-and-white, but the lines were also fuzzy and unclear, the writing was in big letters (thus the printing publisher, LARGE-PRINT) and one of the pictures (L. Frank Baum dedicating this book to all the little boys and girls and Dorothys out there) had a squibble on Dorothy's dress.  Obviously they took Dover's b&w pictures and *badly* copied them.  Not only were the pictures fuzzy, but also many (thankfully not all) of them were manipulated from their original size: the small pictures were big, and the pictures/chapters themselves were on different pages than on earlier and BETTER PUBLISHED editions like 'Books of Wonder' and 'Dover'.  At least 'Dover' had the pictures exactly in the right place. If you don't have a "Ozma of Oz" book at all, I would suggest you to order a 'BOOKS OF WONDER' Edition from a great book-store (Angus & Robertson, Dymmocks, Books Kinokuniya, etc.) and ignore the Thorndike edition, because then you won't have to get rid of or be stuck with a lousy copy (only the ORIGINAL Books of Wonder Edition has the COLOURFUL full-page plates/chapter-title pages AND 2 forgotten side-illustrations on 2 full-page colour plates, which you can see when you search the BOOKS OF WONDER Edition on pages 69 & 89 by entering the following: 'Dorothy opened her tin dinner-pail' and '"The Princess won't like it," said the Maid').  On page 89 of the ORIGINAL Books of Wonder ozma, we see that John R. Neill did draw all 30 heads of Langwidere, although 2 or 3 aren't exactly beautiful. I wouldn't be surprised if ALL the Thorndike Oz Books were the same as this 
 Elizabeth Peters is one of my top 5 favorite authors ever.  However, this book is really bad.  I couldn't even finish it, and I really hate to stop in the middle of a book.  If you haven't read this yet, don't; read _The Crocodile on the Sandbank_ instead.  If you've already read this, please don't judge Ms Peters by this work.  I urge you to give her another shot, because _The Camelot Caper_ is well below the quality of her other books. 
 Sorry this was my lease favorite of Bobby Bear maybe because they where not his songs! 
 After a year-and-a-half wait for the corrected version (the first run had major technical issues) to be released in the U.S., I finally got to sit down and watch this latest live DVD from The World's Greatest Metal Band Ever. Man, was I ever disappointed. I had heard bits here and there about how people didn't like how (Maiden bassist) Steve Harris had edited the footage, but ordinarily I find it's never as bad as people make it out to be. I was wrong. It's that bad. The whole concert is put together with a rapid-fire pace that might be cool for a video single, but not for an entire live show. No shot is ever held for more than 2 or 3 seconds, except between songs.  If you have the CD's you know this is Iron Maiden in their finest live form, but on the DVD you'd never know to look at them, because you can barely see them.   The bonus stuff on disc 3 is pretty good if you're a Maiden diehard like me, but nothing new, really.  All in all, buy the CD, stay away from the DVD, and join me in waiting not-so-patiently for a DVD release of Live After Death, Maiden England and Live at Donington 
  Amongst scads of positive reviews, it's a pleasure to offer a dissenting voice. What is this book?  The book's jacket sez: "this hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive novel ... a narrative particle accelerator ... cooler than zero and unaffectedly affecting, a hilariously funny and deeply serious meditation on the nature and uses of the mind." Cooler than zero? That's called hype, and even though it reads like the shameless promotion for something hollywood, it might be the best writing to be found in this book.    The basic premise & narrative structure of "Hard-Boiled Wonderland," while not especially original or inventive, does hold potential for a meditation on the mind. But Murakami thoroughly fails to touch this space. The characters are caricatures, one-dimensional, facetiously portrayed, and defined entirely by eccentricities. They lack any real sense of an inner life (despite the premise), and are, in most cases, some variation on stock cliches (the "deranged scientist," the "undemure granddaughter," and "various thugs" (this from the book's jacket again)). The narrative itself is also beset by cliché and caricature, not "genre-bending" but derivative, a poorly realized reguritation of big-movie & mass-market conceits.   In fact the very language is often a weary assemblage of catch phrases and common combinations, sometimes laughable in their anesthetizing overuse: "I stood there dumbfounded, as if I'd been hit by a blunt object, overcome by the chilling realization of my utter helplessness" (Ch.3). This is a sense even better conveyed by reading a few pages. And although it's said to be "adroitly translated," Alfred Birnbaum appears to be trying to capture the sense of Murakami's style by casting it in a kind of hackneyed American vernacular.  The science-fiction or cyberpunk elements are watery at best; the book basically equates the mind with a kind of clever computer system that operates according to some fuzzy Freudian misunderstandings. And after living in Japan for a year, its clear that this novel has nothing insightful to offer about the culture or sensibilities of the Japanese, one of Murakami's alleged assets. (For that I recommend Abe or Mishima instead.) The Murakami book-covers are beautifully designed and blurbed with a "cooler than zero" edginess, but after reading this one, its seems clear that Murakami is largely the buzz of a successful marketing engine, rather than an innovator of language and literature. 
 Sure, if you can get past his stereotypes of Native Americans and other ethnic groups; his homophobia; and his racism; then you might actually enjoy this book.  I take that back.  Mr. Vidal is so full of himself, so self-conscious of his sentences, that its impossible to focus on the story.  He's always smirking and trying to show why he's smarter than someone else.  It might be better if he picked up some of the classics and learned a lesson or two.  Is he iconoclastic?  No, just close minded 
 Marlon Brando once said that his friends don't write books about him.  So what does that make Englund?  Marlon said about Carlo Fiore, a once questionable so-called friend, that he probably wrote his book about Marlon because that's all he had left.  The same seems to apply to Englund.  I mean, why describe the gory details of Marlon's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon?  Seriously, would a real 'friend' have done such a thing?  Why not leave us with some glorious memory of Marlon as a true friend would.  I mean, without the help of Englund's book, Marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes, inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today.  Why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the Brando legend?  If Marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma (why we love him), and I believe he did it on purpose, what gives this so-called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows Marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend?  He's a sell-out jerk to me, but that's just my opinion.  Would Alice Marchak (Marlon's assistant) or Jocelyn (Marlon's sister) ever write a book about Marlon?  I don't think so. And they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something, anything about Marlon. They didn't because people who truly love you don't do that.  Englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever, but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life, but not at all in death.  That is the lowest of all the slimballs because Marlon probably died thinking this sell-out was his friend.  NOT!!!  Now that I think about it, while this guy is trying to make everybody think that once Marlon had made his peace with him he could go on and die now, Marlon, in all his glorious brilliance to the end, may have set this guy up, knowing his greed would lead him to go public with Marlon's backside and dung details and show what a jerk he is.  Now that sounds like a Marlon prank, being transparent and naked enough even in his darkest hour to expose the greed that lied in this so-called lifelong friend's heart.  Obviously Marlon knew Englund and that he wasn't a friend. Marlon knew Englund would prove his greed, along with his disloyalty, by making the stupid choice of painting for the world such a gory picture of Marlon's last night when Marlon was brilliant enough and deserved better from a "FRIEND".  The ultimate acting icon pulling the ultimate set-up. Way to go Marlon!  You were a genius to the end.  I see clearly, this bum for what he is.  Englund said that even on his death bed Marlon said "F death".  Well I say even on his death bed Marlon said "F You Georgie". 
 Wilkinson used a simple but effective teaching aid - 3 chairs which are used to represent 3 portraits or spiritual states in which everyone in the world can be divided into as illustrated in the diagram below:  CHAIR ONE - commitment, saved, spiritual	       CHAIR TWO - compromise, saved, carnal 	                 CHAIR THREE - conflict, unsaved, natural  His thesis that by identifying which chair we are sitting on at present, we can make a `spiritual breakthoughs' by making a decision to move from one chair to another.   Firstly, in an effort to make the concept relevant, Wilkinson have oversimplified the process of spiritual growth without reference to grace, spiritual formation, character development and development of new worldview. He seems to give the impression that spiritual breakthroughs is easy and achievable by human effort alone.  Secondly, there is weak theological support for his thesis except using Paul's terms (spiritual, carnal and natural man). In his Biblical example, he used Joshua, elders and children of elders. While he made his point of generational slide, the children of elders were disobedient rather than non believers. But it is true that there is a generational slide if each generation do not develop personal faith in Jesus.  Thirdly, Wilkinson meant the three chairs for Christians, backslidden Christians and non-Christian but there is no reference to the work of Jesus Christ on the cross and of the Holy Spirit in spiritual transformation. Wilkinson seems to imply that spiritual growth can take place by decision making alone.  There cannot be movements between the chairs without adequate appropriation of the theology of the cross and inner transformation without the work of the Holy Spirit especially in his examples of Julia, Ernie and Kate.  Finally, while marriage and parenting is important, one wonders whether the three-chairs model is the right approach. Section 3 & 4 sounds like promotions for Walk-Thru-the Bible Ministries programs. Wilkinson's book promises spiritual breakthroughs but one wonders whether it can delivers except for a short time haze of spiritual high.  
 this stuff has great shine. but it dries my lips and it starts peeling. and uber sticky 
 This book is very misleading.  First of all, as stated in the other reviews, there are an enormous amount of errors located in the book.  I could see this backfiring on many people who are new to the information as the contradictions and misprints will leave a newbie wondering which idea is correct.  I have taken the CEDIA exam and I can say that not a single question located anywhere in that book was on the exam.  I think the book could be a good overview learning tool if they would have bothered to proof read it before going to print 
 I've had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time.  It was thin and the rubber was very grippy (great anti-slip)- once I left my Treo on top of my car (NOT recommended) and drove 10 miles, and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived!    After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it.   The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case, so much so that it's difficult to use the 5-way navigator without it doing what I didn't want it to do.  The case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat, unlike the original.  Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive- since this isn't, I probably won't bother. But in my opinion, there's better products out there 
 I could not figure out from this book how to convert mp3 files to wav files in spite of what it says on page 170 
 Mike Davis, in an interview, admitted that he does not let the facts stand in the way of his arguments. City of Quartz demonstrates this tendency to the fullest. In a previous work, Davis pulled a passage out of a work of fiction and cited it as fact. He shows similar inventiveness in this work, citing studies that were never conducted, inventing interviews, and displaying a creativity with statistics that would be admirable if it weren't for the frightening fact that many who have read this work found it "incisive."   Those who applaud this work do so because it supports their politics. Those who attack it do so because it does not. I tried to remain neutral while reading, but when I read the book I found the inaccuracies to completely outweigh any points made by Davis. His purposeful and methodical deception does more harm than good to his cause.   For more information on this work, see an article at: (...) I would steer clear of Mike Davis and his blatant distortions of the truth 
 ...because as others have stated, it does have incorrect information in it, most glaringly that the Catholic Church is okay with abortion under certain circumstances. If you are a convert or just want to know the facts, pick up Triglio's book "Catholicism for Dummies" and the "Catechism of the Catholic Church." 
 Ok, this book IS funny, THE FIRST TIME YOU LOOK THROUGH IT!!! Overall, i would not recomend this book because it's one of those books, that you'll just look through one time, and one time only! Yeah....there are a lot of positions, but they are all repeated in the book like five times, with different names! And another thing, there are a lot of positions that are not even posible, and some only with a giant swing, or how about a horizantal or verticle pole...yeah many people have those in their houses. BUT SERIOUSLY, THE ONLY POSITIONS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO, ARE THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW ALREADY! ! 
 These Brava anthologies get worse every time. It seems to me that two or three anthologies not unlike this one featuring pretty much the same authors are released every month. I noticed that some of the stories in Merry Christmas, Baby are not only undeveloped and too short for me to care about the characters, but they are also recycled. It is obvious to me that these authors are running out of ideas because this imprint makes them churn out crap at hyper speed. Donna Kaufman's Making Waves and Erin McCarthy's You, Actually are the better ones in this book. I was very disappointed with MaryJanice Davidson in this one. Undercover Claus is Santa Claws from Ellora's Cave's Naughty or Nice anthology, but with some minor alterations. The funny thing is that I read that Naughty or Nice anthology just a few days before reading this book. I can't help losing respect for an author who doesn't even bother to write an original story. I still love her work, but I shall read the stuff she writes for Berkley and for e-imprints in the future. I will read one of her Brava novels only if the plot is interesting (The Royal Treatment, which she wrote for Brava, was actually very good). The Lucy Monroe, Susanna Carr, and Nancy Warren novellas aren't any better. Having read Jingle Bell Rock last year, I should have known better than to read this one. Lucky for me, I borrowed this from a friend to amuse myself during the ninety-minute train ride to work. I suppose that this book was entertaining enough for work travel, but I couldn't help experiencing deja vu while I read the stories and a lot of the passages within them. I won't read any more of these Brava anthologies. They should give these authors some space to actually come out with good, or at least decent, material in the future. For the time being, I recommend the Secret anthologies from Red Sage Publishing 
 I had high hopes based on the jacket and blurbs on the back.  Dobyns writes like a talented high-school student in love with his own ideas.  He has no feel for the English language, his characters are flat and ridiculous, and he hits you in the face with his stupid ideas.  I hate this book 
 This book has the dubious honor of being the WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.  And with the variety and amount of books I read that's saying a lot.  Poorly written, thinly (and that's generous) developed characters, trite dialog, and was there a plot in there somewhere?  I never met a more unlikeable protagonist than Maggie, nor did I care what happened to her or her ex-husbands.  And WTF was Baraba Streisand doing in this???  Truly a nightmare of a novel.  Note to Mr. Patterson:  When you go through the process of writing a book, convincing people to publish it, then ask readers to invest time and money into purchasing and reading it, have a point.  On behalf of all the readers who suffered through til the end, I demand our time and money back 
 More crap from Plimpton, the very definition of athletic supporte 
 I really wanted this book to work.  It seemed to have all the right elements; history, Nazis, action, art and romance.  Ultimately it was too mechanical.  This was Berry's first novel and it was obviously very well-researched.  Maybe his next attempt will be more finished.   THE AMBER ROOM is like a painted room with no curtains.  There's just something missing. 
 Oksendal develops stochastic integration, but only integration with respect to a Brownian Motion integrator, not with respect to local martingale integrators (e.g. The Ito process).  This presents a problem  because in his Finance section (and question 4.3) he wishes to integrate with respect to an Ito process, which is not neccessarily a Brownian Motion.  Based on the theory he has developed in the book, this is not justified! 
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 Who in thier right mind tells you to stockpile gynasmite? very limited use info here, several points that make you think but i belive most would benefit more from a more common sense approac 
 no one listen to this cos87 character.bone are some biten fake rappers that need to get outta here.oh my bad...stay outta here.3 6 has been around since the late 80s and there style is all original. bone was still playin run dmc records when the triple six mafia came out and a lot of the songs they made that this mainstream cos87 dude never even heard of that you can tell bone bit off of. i bet this dude never even heard of lil glock who was with 3 6 in their mixtape  days. stupid layzie bone sounds jus like him.but anyway...this album aint even that great anyway,i was jus angered by this dudes comment 
 Susan Clancy's Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens explores exactly what the title states; however, not in any depth required of a serious scientific study.  Clancy does an insufficient amount of research, writes six chapters stating what she could have easily stated in one, and proceeds to insult her readers in assuming they are unable to perform the simplest of deductions. 	Clancy began her research of "abductees" by placing ads in newspapers reading, "Have you been abducted by aliens?"  Surely, a study of this nature being conducted at Harvard should be approached with more caution.  Any sane person would assume that the ad is some kind of joke, or even an experiment conducted by an "abductee" herself.  The wording alone would only attract strange people, which would then further the assumption that anyone claiming to have been abducted is not normal, or sane for that matter.  In order to be taken seriously, Clancy should have chosen more appropriate wording to get her point across.  After reading the footnote, I found that Clancy had actually been requested to change the wording in the ads to something more professional.  So far, Clancy is off to a very rough start. 	During her research, Clancy makes it a point to consider each "abductee's" story as a serious matter.  She believes these stories must be taken seriously in order to properly approach the issues of how and why people believe that they have been abducted by aliens.  Clancy's research consists of many interviews with many different types of people; however, for something Clancy takes so seriously, that is an insufficient amount of research.  She never searches for hard evidence, or even asks for it.  She makes no visits to their homes to see what kind of environment they live in, among other things.  Any conclusion drawn solely on the accounts of people who are "out there" to begin with is nonsense.  From this moment on, it is nearly impossible to take any of Clancy's deductions seriously.   	The first chapter of the book is called "How do you wind up studying aliens?"  I highly doubt that anyone who buys a book titled Abducted is hoping to get twenty pages on how the author stumbled upon such a topic.  I read the book to learn about Clancy's research and conclusions, not to learn how she got into such a field.  Each chapter thereafter says practically the exact same thing, with exception to some of the explanations that Clancy gives for rare varying abduction stories.  She is excruciatingly repetitive in stating that their experiences must be from sleep paralysis, hypnotism, or simply having watched too much TV.  Clancy spends a great deal of the book recalling a countless number of abduction stories that, by the third chapter, seem to all generally be the same.  The only time the book is of any interest is when she finally gets to her point and tells the reader what has, for no reason at all, taken her so long to say.  An example of this would be chapter three in its entirety, where the point is that hypnosis could distort and alter memory.  I highly doubt that she needed an entire chapter to get that idea across. 	Which brings me to my next point.  Clancy, throughout the book, proceeds to insult her readers in assuming they are unable to perform the simplest of deductions.  She even seems to assume that her readers do not even know the most basic of scientific terms.  I am only twenty-one and reading my first book on alien abductions, and even I know every single term she so explicitly explained eight times each.  Clancy will clearly explain, step by step, how she deduced from an abduction story that the "abductee" must have been experiencing sleep paralysis, which after hearing the definition so many times, I, along with the majority of her readers, could have done in my sleep.  It seems as though Clancy wrote her book with an incompetent audience in mind.  Her writing makes Carl Sagan's writing look like Latin! 	Overall, I would not recommend this book.  I was bored the entire way through which is quite terrible considering the book's length.  Most of what I learned from reading Clancy's Abductions: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens I could have learned from a five minute conversation with my high school science teacher.  Clancy not only does insufficient research, causing her conclusions to be nonsense, but she repeats the same ideas over and over as if she has nothing else to say.  She spends the majority of the book explaining terms and pointing out the most obvious of deductions, which I find rather insulting.  Of course, the icing on the cake is the two blatant errors, one spelling and one grammatical, made in the writing, which ironically enough, is the only part of the book I actually enjoyed 
 This is supposed to be "the" bible on Excell. And it is; it has everything there's to know. BUT, if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done, don't buy this book. This book, as well as other "bibles" series, are design with a whole CD program with sample exercises. If you go thru them, step by step, you'll learn your stuff. But, if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly, you will find that their explanation is EXACTLY AS THE HELP FUNCTION ON THE SOFTWARE. And then, the will give you an example from that CD program. Believe me, if you don't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis, this book won't do it. The same applies to the Access Bible.. 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens. I bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite. Sorry to say that we just did not like any of these. A little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy. 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 I would have given this book an additional star if it wasn't for the terrible art on the cover. I was embarrassed to read this novel in public. The marketing for this series really cheapens the writing. My friends laugh at me when I show them these books, then insist they are good. I would never buy such an ugly book in hardcover. Get with the times, TOR 
 This book was a disappointment.  I was expecting more than a book of lists containing many "fill-in-the-blanks" pages at the end.  Even Chicken Soup for Single Parents was better than this very slim book that has practically no content 
 I caught some of this on PBS and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast Reba McEntire as Nellie.  Musicals are for people that can sing, not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch.  I'm a native of Arkansas, by the way, and it hurts my ears to listen to Reba's voice.  Reba's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is 
 This album is perfectly titled because he is probably the only one who is feeling it. Besides this album cover resembling Don Cartegena(his best album!) and the title ripped from an old De La Soul classic, Fat Joe doesnt give you anything you spectacular. No its not worser than All Or nothing but its still bad. He does have some dope tracks which are DAMN(all his songs should sound like this so why dont they?) NO DRAMA(sick beat, mediocre lyrics), BENDICION MAMI(great tribute to his mom), THINK ABOUT IT  HARD NOT TO KILL and STORY TO TELL but his album is weighed down heavily by these rusty anchors. Filler: Make It Rain and She's My Momma and Jealousy is bubblegum rap at its worst and Im still tring to figure out how Make It Rain became an anthem out here in South Florida. The song is bootycrack plus that has to be the worst beat Scott Storch has made! Pendemic needs to be redone. The Profit is better than Make It Rain but is that saying much? Breathe And Stop, which poorly samples Bob Marley's War is so dull I had to punch my self in the balls just to stay awake! And isnt that the dullest hook you've ever heard provided by The Game? Bottom Line: While this album is not worser than his previous work it is still forgettable like his previous albums. Joe raps decent on certain tracks and some of the beats are tight. You dont get the full package with Joe on this one and that why it will fall on deaf ears(all the pop albums he made notwithstanding). Fat Joe at his best: Jealous Ones Envy and Don Cartegena. Fat Joe at his worst: All Or Nothing, J.O.S.E., Represent(back when he was called Fat Joe De Gangsta),Loyalty and Me Myself and I. Thats five bad albums that Joe has made throughout his career. I think its about time for Fat Joe to hang it up. 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 I think they put the wrong cd in the case because most of sublimes good stuff is missing.  Weird.  Buy 40oz to freedom or anything other than this cd if you do not already have them.  It's has some good songs but false advertisement comes to mind.  Hardcore sublimers may want it, but you never really have to open it.      
 Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure 
 Simply put, I didn't like it. Emma Thompson was too old to play a 19 year old. Not only did the movie leave out a/o change alot of what was written in the book the movie left out a/o changed the characters. So, once again I must say, I didn't like it.. 
 forget the tom wolfe comparison. this book is simply BORING! i'm half through reading it, but i'm still waiting for something interesting to happen. if nobody tells me that the second half is much, much better than the first, i'm going to throw it away (which i rarely do). how could i believe this excellent book review (in a swiss newspaper) 
 Give me a break.  MIchael Drosnin has written the worst book of the new century.  Actually think about what everybody is saying because there is nboway that these codes can even be valid.  Nuff Said.  I have done my work, read all the other reviews (including Kazuo, ahem).  gift?  WHo tags this piece of _____ with gift 
 Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD  transfer, I was only referring to the "That Touch of Mink" DVD.  The Father Goose DVD is not that bad 
 Nadia Choucha's book "Surrealism and the Occult" is a failure on every level, partly because she fails to do more than skim the surface of the surrealists interest in the occult and even that inadequately. She fails to even mention Victor Brauner, obviously hasn't the faintest idea of the connections between surrealists such as Jorge Camacho and Martin Stejskal and alchemy, nor the importance of figures such as Malcolm de Chazal, the great philosopher of analogy. She substitutes a clumsy and fictitious tie-in with Kenneth Grant and Austin Spare and although a comparison between Spare's automatism with the surrealist concept might have been interesting, she largely botches this because she simply has not done her research properly.  I am told that Choucha originally wrote this as an undergraduate dissertation. It should have stayed that way. It could have been the starting point for a much better book if only she had bothered to find out enough to write the book that it should have been. A silly book, written out of ignorance. What a shame. And what  a shame that there is no other book that covers the whole of this underesearched area that could replace Choucha's. There is a great opening here for any real scholar, or better still, surrealist, who cares to make the effort.  
 I have progressively become more and more disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's books in the past decade. Her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- Southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. Blessedly, "Whisker of Evil" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. Rita Mae Brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of Virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only Virginians understand these things. That's just simply not true.  That said, there were some delightful aspects of "Whisker of Evil" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters were adorable as ever, and I loved learning more about Harry as a person and what makes her tick. Her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. I liked reading more about her home and her relationships. However, the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of Rita Mae Brown's fan base? It was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too far and I found myself skipping pages. As well, I almost threw the book across the room when I came across a line that stated in so many words that only Virginians have manners. This is a common theme of Ms. Brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. There is a big, big world outside of Virginia -- Rita Mae Brown should know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. I would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. Enough already about Southern manners (a biased perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and horse), and foxhunting.   Whatever happened to characters like Celeste Chalfonte 
 Some of the characters and story lines are interesting in and of themselves.  However, the story line doesn't progress.  Who cares about angels?  Not me.  I'm sorry my book group selected this story.  My suggestion--read something else that truly develops characters and plot 
 it doesnt fit well. the joystick doesnt function right with it on. the buttons are difficult to use. the product was poorly mad 
 I consider myself a diehard Star Wars fan but judging by my reaction to this book, apparently I am not.  I love the Star Wars series and wanted more background.  The visual dictionary series is pretty good for this purpose but I was looking for something that would provide more background and I would forgo the pictures.  This book, however, goes way beyond my interest.  It's basically an exhaustive account of the people and events of the ENTIRE Star Wars universe ever created from a very, very long time ago in a galaxy very, very far, far away.  There is little information about the 6 movies but pages upon pages of information on characters from before the pre-trilogy and after the trilogy.  While I'm certain this appeals to true diehards this is not at all of interest to me 
 The Nissan story certainly should be compelling and Ghosn himself is a rockstar business celebrity.  How come the book was so dull and after reading it I still didn't know what Ghosn had actually done to turn around Nissan?  Two things recommend this book:  Ghosn's recollections of starting out at Michelin...his portrait of that privately owned corporation was much more interesting than his Nissan story; and as a companion to the Reckoning, David Halberstam's history of Detroit that focused on Ford's eclipse by none other than Nissan.  To find out that Nissan was already rotting from within by the time Halberstam was finishing his great book, makes this poor one at least an interesting appendix 
 This book is such a downer.  Besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown-up sisters, and all of the complicated problems between Julie & Romeo's families, we have an eight-year old, Sarah, running the show in Julie's house.  Besides watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory endlessly, she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets!!  They have their very own Veruca Salt living in that house!!    If you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone, this is the book for you.  It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first one.   
 Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.  1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well 2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste' 3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 2003 4)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.  I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.  I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.  I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.  Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new? 
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 How hard can it be , shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger 
 "Camp Stories" is a movie that ironically does not have a story, let along stories.  David (played by Zach Zaylor) is forced to attend a Jewish all-boys camp when he would rather stay home and watch movies all summer.  His parents tell him the reason he must go is, "Because your Jewish!"  I knew I was in for a long 90 minutes when I heard that line.  David quickly establishes himself as a hot-shot when he accepts a challenge from the reigning rafterball champ, Paul (Kris Park) and beats him.  From there, David's camp adventures just get more and more exciting (YEAH RIGHT).  The movie suffers from a lack of anything that would keep a viewer interested.  The actors just plod along in a very episodic manner, there is literally nothing that happens in this movie that you will remember 5 minutes after you finish watching it.  I served as an extra in this movie, and was unfortunate enough to see how poorly this film was made.  How they got the actors they did (Elliot Gould, Jason Biggs, Jerry Stiller) is beyond me, but sadly I don't think any actor could have saved this script 
 I am planning a trip to Athens next spring. I love to walk. What could be better than a book of 14 walks through Athens? Not this book. The few maps that are included are of poor quality and hard to read. There is no correlation between the maps and the text portion of the book. There is no information on how to get around modern Athens. This book would be perfect for an armchair traveler. This book would not be helpful for someone who expected to use this book as a reference while actually strolling through Athens.    
 As a graduate professor who teaches several course on M&A, I've chosen two other efforts from publisher John Wiley for this year's curriculum over Pat Gaughan's updated version of his old book. Jeffrey Hooke's "Practical Guide to Doing the Deal" covers most of the same material in a more interesting style and "Winning at Mergers & Acquisitions" shows my students how all of this applies to the real world. Mark Clemente & David Greenspan, authors of "Winning at M&A", helped my students to understand the business rationale behind deals and brought to light many of the reasons so many corporate combinations fail. In addition, the juicy chapters on strategy, due diligence and culture and a whole section on integration best practices -- I feel -- will prepare serious readers on the topic and students of business alike for the M&A challenges that actually exist in corporate America today. Case studies and testaments on what works and what doesn't from corporate VPs and CEOs involved in mergers and acquisitions make "Winning at M&A" the core content I've already added to next year's syllabus. As for John Wiley's reprinting of Gaughan's book, they probably should have asked Hooke and Gaughan to collaborate on an updated version rather than publish two versions of the same manuscript 
 I'm currently using this textbook for a class, and I have to say that it is the WORST text book I have ever read.  Its explanations are never clear and always cluttered with pointless notation which obfuscates its readability.    For instance, it will constantly explain things like "index x whose range is 1...X" for some complicated equation, and then sort of skim over what is actually going on in the rest of the equation.  Just a clue:  If I could understand the dense, utterly frustrating, notation-crufty equations you let pass unexplained, it would be IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS (as it already is) that X was the upper bound on your indexing variable x.  In fact, you wouldn't even need to explain that x was an indexing variable:  I would be able to tell from its use in your sum notation (as I already am).  Use the text to actually EXPLAIN IN ENGLISH the significance of the OBSCURE parts of your notation.  This book focuses on explaining the trivially obvious points of its equations and leaves out CLEAR and STAIGHT-FORWARD explanations for what the processes going on in its notation mean.  The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it is obviously a wonderful book for someone who is a graduate-level math student, not a vanilla computer science student (even a fairly math savvy one) 
 This book attempts to link disconnected half-truths with pseudologic to push an idealogical agenda.  It is shocking an disappointing to me that in a time of war we allow enemy propaganda like this to demoralize our populace and troops. 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 If this book would have been completely "intact," it would have been one of the greatest sources of Japanese erotic life in my personal library. However, besides numerous grammatical errors (please excuse any in my review!), the book skips three entire stories before arriving in a part of the book which has no connection to the previous tale. For example, the book skips from page 146 to 243 - 274. Then it goes down from page 274 to 179 and then back up through 243 all the way to page 402. So basically, this book is missing 33 entire pages that never rematerialize (please keep in mind no pages where physically ripped out, they just aren't there). I don't know if I got my hands on a "bad" copy or if this is how all of them are. PLEASE, BEFORE BUYING YOUR OWN COPY OF THIS BOOK, FIND OUT IF IT IS WHOLE FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Sullivan was one of the best around.  But somehow he has become just another doom and gloom pundit.  He even manages to equate the Christian right with the Islamo terrorists. It is a shame to see such a talented guy become an extremist too.  His optimism has been replaced by cynicism and hate.  He used to make arguments and discuss both sides and how he ridicules others and calls them names.  
 this bratz looks very pretty but she is fianna she shound  not have blond hair she shound have brown because i have  funk out fianna wild life safari fianna and flash back fever fianna and they all have brown hair 
 I bought this book with the intention to learn something but i have not. The book is sectioned into lengthy paragraphs. the author also throws in some comments and interviews from other investment guru (how guru are they) but it makes reading even more confusing,  more often, the interviews serve no purpose to the chapter and tends to deviate away from topic.  A better book would be "The trading habits of warren buffett and georege soros"  A bad book for new investors 
 N.E.W. and it seems AMAZON have no idea of why there are three prices for the 4-year plan. The only solution that I could find from other reviews is possibly based on the price of the TV, ie when you check the price of a TV and scroll down to the bottom of the page, the price of the 2 and 4 year warrantees will be different for each TV. Based on that price, select either 2 or 4 years warrantee and add to your cart. 
 I hate to part company with the other reviewers here, as well as the Amazon comments but this NOT a must have.  I am huge fan of New Order and Joy Division and think they are one of the most important modern western popular bands of the last, almost thirty years for all their well-known contributions to existentilism and furturism in alternative, independent rock. Basically inventing post-punk, being one of the inventors of the dance-music, electronica scene a decade before most other bands and accidentaly inventing "goth" music along the way.  Not to mention being excellent musicians with a very artsy, deep and humorous sensitivity.  But, because they are such a good band it is glarringly obvious that the "rock video" is nothing more than a corporate music business era chore that bands just have to do as part of the job.  Film critic Rodger Ebert once said the rock video is "empty."  Here, they aren't so much empty as New Order's music is so good, just pointless.               I find myself almost angry that a beautiful song such as "Ceremony" would have such a terrible video like this(incidently, I do not know what the viewer below is talking about...there is no original version of the "Ceremony" video...just this thing). An aweful, unwatchable piece of useless garbage featuring a fellow walking around with a trashbag on his head. I guess that is a reference to the thought process of music video directors. Not sure what else it could be. I could only stomach 40 seconds of this filth. I'm afraid after listening to this tune for more than ten years, both Joy Division's and New Order's...the images in mine and in other musician's heads will have to do. Unwatchable. Trash. The new "Tempation" video....embarrasing.  Watch their concert videos, go see them live or better yet, think for yourself.  There are a few winners..."Confusion" is a classic and a great video as well as little bit of music history.  "Perfect Kiss" is cool but I've seen it enough and life is short. "Touched By the Hand of God" is very funny..but ..again..life is short. The only thing I hadn't seen before and actually kind of liked was the Gina Birch "Crystal"..that was a slightly cool workday music industry bit. Not important art in anyway....but better than Franz Fernidad peeing on an art gallery wall like the Nazis used to do.  Videos?  As for the documentary on the other disc. This is much better but is almost 13 years old. There are some excellent Joy Division clips here. Why don't we have a full DVD of all the Joy Division footage in the world yet? You get many of the same videos on the other disc played in full again on THIS disco too..in case you're someone like me who hated them enough the first time. Some great stuff, a bit of live Joy Division, great early live versions of 'Blue Monday", "Tempation"..and yes.."Ceremony". The interviews are great as New Order speaks like real musicians and their collaborators are an interesting bunch making up a lot of what urban nightlife music culture has been from the late seventies until today on both sides of the Atlantic. 
 Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management.  This book is not a good choice for college-level courses. 
 I found this book to be too much of a "cookbook". Information is good, but not enough at all. The section about the divisionals is bad..why tell you how to construct a navamsa or hora chart if she doesn't tell you  how to use it during interpretation? It's an okay introductory text..but I  strictly mean "just okay". Light on Life by Hart DeFouw is *MUCH*  better, although you must be more of an intellectual to grasp the  information. Dreyers book was written for attention spanned challenged  Americans, I think. It was one of the first jyotish books I bought, but I  don't refer back to it when I have a question. I couldn't recommend this  book 
 "A Man for All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts" was not my style.  I adore plays, and this era in time, but this play disappointed me, and I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it, as I had high hopes.  I looked at the play, as if I were to perform in it, and it did not strike my fancy.  With practically no stage direction, and little direction of emotion, I thought to myself how I would hate to perform it.  I do give credit for it being such a short play, when this time in history was anything but short and sweet.  I do not recommend 
 And now for a dissenting view:  Because of this work (and the lack of any other in-depth scholarship on the subject) people have tended over the years to associate Kenneth Grant with the Qliphoth.  In fact, when you say "Qliphoth", many people immediately think "Grant" without hesitation.  When I started doing my own studies of the World of the Shells in 1994, this was one of the first books I sought out because of its notoriety.  I referenced it many times over the last eleven years, and I have to say that every time I did I found it almost completely useless in terms of giving meaningful information on the Qliphoth.    Grant takes HIS interpretations of the VIII*, IX*, and XI* of OTO, and mixes them with Voodoo, H.P Lovecraft, and a good dollop of (sometimes faulty) gematria.  This array of symbolism he then pigeon holes into 22 pieces which he calls the "Tunnels of Set".  It is my opinion while while this work is very imaginative and creative, it has nothing to do with the Qliphoth.  The Qliphoth are actually the waste and rotting dead matter of the spirit that accumulate when the True Will is neglected.  It's all too human.  Grant doesn't even go there.  In Dion Fortune's _The Mystical Qabalah_ she has a few pages which she devotes to the Qliphoth, and I believe that she has more useful data on them in those few pages than Grant provides in this entire thick, expensive volume.    Unfortunately, There is no one else to recommend at this time as far as the Qliphoth is concerned.  Until someone else provides an alternative, Grant is really all that's out there on this subject (at least nominally).  He's the only fish currently in the pond, and all anybody sees there is him.  This book is a clear example of a case where simply because somebody sounds like they know what they are talking about, it doesn't really mean that they do.  Yes, it's creative, and I like some of the imagery and artwork, but I think that Grant missed the point entirely 
 The book is most useful as a source of references. A wide range of planning tools and techniques are mentioned, but treated in very small depth, and the text denotes little practical experience of the author in the management of true corporations, as when he states that The planning of strategy to identify a firm's mission, goals and objectives, ..., represents the difference between success and failure in today's environment (sic). There's certainly much more to success and failure in real world corporations than that. The reprint of the Telecommunications Acts of 1996 and 1934 occupies almost half of the book 
 I bought this book for my wife - a feminist, a mother of 4, a psychology graduate student, a conservative and a Christian. According to this book the down fall of motherhood is because of people like "Clair Huxtable", Princess Diana, Kathie Lee Gifford and the Christian Right. This author has some skeletons in her closet and carries her baggage through the whole book. This book was so jaded by this my wife was unable to read it. Here is an example of the bias in the book. In the center of the book are a few pages of pictures, here are two of the captions, "When Susan Smith killed her two children, she was widely vilified, and became a symbol of motherhood in peril. Smith got little sympathy for suffering from mental illness or for having been, for years, a victim of sexual abuse by her Christian Coalition stepfather." and "When Andrea Yates, a stay-at-home, fundamentalist Christian, home-schooling mother with five small children, drowned them all in 2001, much was made of the dangers of post-partum depression and psychosis. But many mothers also saw the tragedy as a warning sign about the tyranny of the new momism."  Typically I would resell the book here on Amazon, but in order to spare you... I threw it away 
 About average for the price, nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight.  The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot.  This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there. 
 I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera  for every episode thereafter.   Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's "Shadow Baby" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts 
 I started reading this to my 6 and 8 year old, and got about 5 chapters into it before I started to doubt my choice of reading material for these kids. For one thing, the language is archaic and hard to wrap your mouth around. But for another, the values expressed in this 300 year old book are a bit disturbing. The God-fearing family runs aground on an idyllic island full of naturally growing fruits and vegetables, and arrives with supplies aplenty to draw from, but within a week they have slaughtered at least a dozen creatures. Seems to me the main theme of the book is "man's dominance over nature." Doesn't work for me 
 In this short book, Wolfe purports to tell us that the entire American art scene (ie ALL abstract art) of the post-WWII years is nothing but verbiage, a creation of a bunch of second-rater critics. I find this kind of generalization absolutely breathtaking in its arrogance and facile dismissiveness.  By what criterion does Wolfe make this judgment?  By the fact that there were a bunch of high-falutin' critics who explained it to those who wanted to be taken by fashion.  While this is a common enough phenomenon in a nationalistic sense (pride in the output of one's country), I think it only applies to individuals rather than an entire scene.  Afterall, the astract artists like Pollack belonged to a continuous milieu, which runs the gamut from Bob Dylan and John Coltrane right through the Beat Generation writers and Pollack and his cohorts and even TV like the Outer Limits and Twilight Zone.  Were all of them and all they did first rate?  Perhaps not, but I wd argue that there area a lot of wonderful things there as well, reflections of a time even if they don't quite measure up to the earlier generation of modernists like Picasso and Matisse.  I wd not dismiss them so cavalierely, so cynically, as if you can emcompass all they stood for in a single argument.  This book is for those who want to appear as glib smartas*es 
 Picked up this book for it's potential from the first book. I finished it, but definately lets say it was a struggle. The main characters seems to fall into the same mistakes that failed them in the first book. Do they ever learn from their mistakes? None of the characters seems to really do anything (besides celimus)  other than just talk about their problems and after they talk about it the baddie just comes along knowing everything and makes them have more things to talk about. As I've said earlier, Celimus is sooo annoying in his 1 dimensionality that it makes me sick. I wanted to really like this book for what it could had been!!! Really!! I tried!!  2 1/2 star 
 Okay, here is the deal.  This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it.  It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble.  It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it.  Hell, it might even pull your pants down.  The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).  If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine.  Pass on this clunker 
 While this book is not an utter garbage, there's nothing remarkable about it either, at least in my opinion. There's a certain wit and charm to "Fat Girls...", but that in itself doesn't save it from being mediocre. Even though miss Peck says that she's not a professional writer, by any means, it still feels as if though you need be a part of her family in order to enjoy this book. There's no humor in here, despite whatever reviews are saying - its just a number of observations on life, good ones at that, but I was looking for something else.  Bonus points for an excellent books cover. 
 this is whining of a group that in the recent past were masters of all they surveyed, and now they have been given a reality check and been deposed from the position of lord and master of the house. now men aren't sure what their "role" is--i guess they can't think of any other way to be men than to financially lord it over their wives and children. the author thinks teenage women should have children and claims that is when they are at the height of their reproductive years. i guess he never saw the study that showed that women are not fully biologically developed, even at 17 and 18, and that having a child while still a teenager is dangerous both to the mother and the baby with an increased risk of miscarriage and infant mortality. my mother grew two inches when she was 18 and pregnant with my older sister--a clear case of two babies trying to grow at the same time. but i don't think mr. tiger thinks in terms of safety for anything but his ego--and keeping women barefoot and pregnant, and unable to go to college and have a career, and dependent on a man for support, keeps women from threatening the male ego. and if the man actually stays and supports his young wife and children, fine and great, but i think it is men that are conflicted about the role of provider and breadwinner. they want to be the big cheese but when the going gets tough they take off and lolita and the baby get to depend on the state for support. i just think that men should walk their masculine talk or shut up and stop whining like sissies. at the end of the book we get a parting jab at feminists-they are "immature" and "paraniod". however nobody sounds more immature and paranoid than these lost confused man-children 
 I was interested in this book for 2 reasons: to understand what worked and to see the rantings and ravings of a madman. I purchased this book similar to the way people slow down to see car accidents on the side of the freeway. Mostly, I found the book the same way German found it when it was initially published - long winded and boring comservative rethoric. Before putting the book down, I made the distinction that if Hitler were a plitician in modern America, he would definately be one of the staunch Republicans who are afraid of science, social progress and their own shadows. On a positive note, the book further reveals the idiocy of his following as it reads a bit like the book of Mormon...not interesting.  
 The Las Vegas Hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Buren and Ferlin Huskey. It appears to be a low budget film due to the photography, acting and settings. If you are a Jayne or Mamie fan, you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only. One highlight of the film is Ferlin Husky's dream sequence of Jayne singing "That Makes It." Air time of Jayne is very small. Trivia: the Siamese cat in the film, which Jayne is holding, belonged to Jayne's friend May Mann. 
 All you have to do is turn off your mind, relax and float downstream and you too can be a wealthy writer and go jetsetting with all your glamorous friends. Any actual writers reading this advice are probably expiring of laughter.    Being able to construct a simple sentence with proper spelling and grammar does not, in itself, make you a writer. It would seem to be a prerequisite of becoming one, but the lady who wrote this book apparently feels that it is preferable to lose control and write gibberish -- perhaps she's trying to encourage students to write the kind of garble that passes for "intelligent literature" nowadays.   Unfortunately, being told that you have the ability to write does not mean that you have the ability to write well in terms of plot, story structure, word choice and all the other elements necessary to high-quality, memorable writing (marketable or otherwise). Skip the autobiographical content; get what you can out of the guidelines. 
 I had purchased this book hoping it would help me to run my ISP business, perhaps providing me with some advice and pointers. Instead, I received a long-winded book which spends more time covering the basics of how the  Internet works, it's history, and tons of other garbage that I already  knew. This book should have been titled "The Internet, it's history,  it's protocols, and a few things to keep in mind if you want to be BORED  with the Internet.&quot 
 Though this is by no means Argento's worst film (his Phantom of the Opera was pure rubbish), this film is also not among his best, and was a disappointment even to Argento (he considered the production of this film cursed--in a way himself buying into the superstition which was part of the plot of the film).  For the Argento fan this film is quite enjoyable in a piecemeal sort of way, but it simply does not work as a whole.  The plot is fraught with enormous gaps in logic.  The scene when characters in the film rely on the memory of birds to identify the killer among opera audience members is utterly absurd, and the end monologue in which the herione announces that she doesn't need other people and has a lot in common with insects is absolutely random, nonsensical, and has absolutely nothing to do with what preceded it in the film.  Such scenes aside, what hurts this film the most is its absolutely corny heavy metal soundtrack, which has a very negative overall impact on the mood and atmosphere established by the film.  This said, the notorious "peephole scene" is one of Argento's most brilliant and effective sequences in any of his films, and this movie is well worth viewing for this scene alone 
 I never received this item. I thought I ordered it and I just got this email asking me what I think of it.  However I don't see this item in my "last six months" orders.  Did something go wrong?  ANy ideas?  An 
 I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?  
 This series (up to book 4/5) was one of my favorites. There were little things that bugged me, but I considered it to be a masterpiece.  A coupld of things have caused me to completely give up on this series after this book.  * Detail is great and all, but please make something happen. There are very few books that I haven't finished, but I was close with this one due to the lack of real events furthuring the story.   * ENOUGH with the 'Men are stupid, tug on my braids' mentality! RJ likes to infuse his charecters with the inability to understand the opposite gender. When will they learn what most mature adults learn? If I didn't know better I'd say that RJ is a feminist man-hater.  I could overlook these annoyances when the rest of the story was fantastic, but that just isn't the case with this book 
 I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping.   The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.    In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls).   Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help.   Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball.  
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my husband since plank cooking is a cooking style that we enjoy.  We have been disappointed with this book.  Each of the recipes that we tried was inedible and some have inconsistencies and inacuuracies in the recipes.  I originally decided to purchase the book because I liked the photography and the layout and I can only hope that similar attention to detail will be added to the recipes themselves.  We have now relegated this book to a new role as a fire starter.  
 If you want a pretty view of cobain read this.  I think I've read 4 bio's on Kurt.  This book makes him normal, just a guy with some pain and an alienation problems, so he does lots of drugs and kills himself.  How romantic.  A more realistic read is Christopher Sandfords Kurt Cobain.  It ain't pretty but it reads honest 
 the first half of the book is hype about what will happen in the second half.  something along the lines of: "i dont know why sensei acted why he did, something bad  mustve happened in his life, he was an annoying jerk, so i hope something really bad happened to him that can justify his being such a jerk who is annoying."  does the second half justify the first?  hardly.  sensei remains a jerk, and even goes beyond that by refusing to change, and even beyond that by transforming his pupil into a jerk.  what a bunch of jerks.  about the only person who is not a jerk in the book is the wife, who both the narrator and sensei view as just a stupid woman, you know, those types of humans who dont know how to think or really serve any purpose except to worship sensei.  man that guy is irritating! and the narrator too!    spoiler   the stupid kid leaves his dying dad so he can see the dead sensei!  what a jerk!  his dad is so much nicer to him!  the stupid sensei treats his wife like crap and never tells her why!  then he kills himself so she can be depressed, without telling her why!  what a jerk!  and he tells the kid but not her!  and he forbids the kid to tell her!  what a jerk!  
 There have been a dozen or more "boy's books" lately, most notably the exceptional Raising Cain, by Kindlon and Thompson.  Most of them are not worth the bother, and this compendium is at the top of that list 
 I heard that song recently "Three Strange Days"...and I recalled how much I detested it when it came out.  Overt pandering to tyros in altered states.  Now I can't get it out of my head, and may require a lobotomy.  There was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91; but this wasn't part of that canon.  Nice try School of Fish.  Have fun playing the CYO circuit 
 I'll admit this book is for younger kids, but I have to say that it was not very good at all.  Even when I read it for the first time when I was ten years old I didn't think it was very good.  The characters are all faceless and boring, except for Han who is  hugely exaggerated.  The writing is also boring and unimaginative, and very undiscriptive.  Children ten and under probably won't care, but adults and older kids such as myself should stick with Young Jedi Knights, and some of the adult novels 
 Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?   
  Thousands of little girls, armed only with bamboo spears and knives , are able to overcome an army of thousands of adult, Chinese revolutionaries? Many of the men are killed, but not one of the little girls is hurt? Does this seem plausible? A large group of intelligent, well educated men and women copy the culture and social structure of Victorian England? Is this reasonable? Absurdities compounding absurdities throughout the book.   Protracted , boring sections detail Nell's Fairy Tale adventures seeking magical keys in different castles. Nell's fantasy adventures are the primer's method of teaching and helping Nell to become a young woman who can think for herself and survive in a hostile world. OK , but there was too much of this for my taste.  With the possible exception of Nell, the characters lacked depth, they didn't fully come alive for me. We need to learn more about them, their backgrounds and motivations.  There were some interesting descriptions of nanotechnology, individual atoms being assembled into microscopic machines. Matter compilers essentially give people everything they need instantly. How would such technology affect our lives and culture? This was thought provoking and is the reason I gave the book two stars instead of one. There is the potential for a very good book here, but this isn't it 
 I borrowed this book from my local public library.  It is filled with darling projects - in fact, a friend asked me to make the shell-edged shrug for her.  Well, it started out fine, but about halfway up the first sleeve, the instructions went wacky.  Realizing the book was first published in Great Britain and translated to American (the crochet terms are very similar, but a G.B. single crochet is a U.S. double crochet), I tried to work with it using the photo as a guide.  When it was time to shape the shoulder, front, and back, however, the instructions became incoherent.  I gave up at that point - it just wasn't worth the struggle.    I've crocheted for many years, and it is rare that I find a pattern that stumps me so completely.  Needless to say, I've found a different pattern with a similar finished look to make for my friend, and I won't attempt any of the other projects in the book.  I don't have time for this 
 Why does Franken have to continually "borrow" names from those who are politically opposed to get himself some attention? Without the constant use and abuse of names like "Limbaugh" and "O'Reilly" (with radio and tv ratings to prove their success)in his titles - would ANYONE take a second look? I have to wonder.... 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake. 
 The minute I took the monopod out of cover it broke. The mounting head fell apart from the leg. The glue they use is very bad. I didn't return the product because I think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. I just fixed it myself 
 My wife and I were up for a romantic comedy. This one is neither. Woody Allen was okay, but Scarlett's acting seemed forced. The plot was entirely predictable and very boring. I regret wasting 90 minutes on this one 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 I liked Legends of the Fall and the other two novellas that were in that book but I got bored reading this, maybe after about 40 pages or so. I found myself getting depressed just thinking that somehow I should force myself to keep reading this rambling, pointless, overly detailed coming of age type story. Finally I just said the heck with it and turned it back into the library, so happy that I didn't buy it. I would have to have absolutely nothing else going on in my life in order to tolerate this kind of book. I've noticed that many writers, after they get some fame, decide to write one of these tour-de-force books and they are almost always very bad and very boring.  
 If you like being lied to, you'll love this collection of fiction and fairy tales provided by a hand picked whitewash council of highly compromised puppets. The largest attack on American soil and the Bush Crime Syndicate ignored requests over two years from the victims families to investigate what went wrong that day, until finally they gave in and formed this joke of a commission. The results are an insult to anyone with any knowledge of the actual facts, but facts are not what this report is about. The only purpose was to verify the Official Story and to shield those who were responsible for this self inflicted wound. 
 I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his?  Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the "cast of characters" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters.  The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it.  I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it 
 The best out of three guide books I looked at, and a must for the first trip to the big island.  
 Packaged with four left legs (requires two left, two right)   One briquette grate is smaller than the other and falls to bottom as a result.   Had to drill / elongate hole to install grate support bracket   Paint on handles started to run when I handled them with wet hands. I tried to rinse off the remaining paint or ink under running water so that it will not continue to bleed off. What paint do you know of that rinses off under plain water?   Right cast iron grate cracked when it came in contact with heat.    The design and construction of this product shows clear disregard for the consumer and is absolutely unacceptable at any price. I have to question at this point weather or not the paint used on the grill and grates is toxic or lead based. I've come across my share of junk but this is really bad!    
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 Oh did this one stink.  Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless.  I didn't laugh once 
 I would never buy this TV again or a Samsung product for that matter. I obviously purchased a lemon, have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck. Samsung initially told me I would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when I called back I was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period. How's that for sound logic.   I really like it when it works, but, unfortunately, an important aspect of a TV is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button. 
 As a professional my self I do not advice to buy this book, the reason is simple: People who are involved in mixed paellas (meats & seafood) do not understand the true soul of this dish. Ask anyone in Valencia what he thinks about mixing shrimp with meats, Its a herecy! I recomend you buy the book "100 Paellas & 1 Fidehuá, this is the closest you will be to the real thing but is in Spanish only. THE MIXED PAELLA WAS CREATED DURING THE TURIST BOOM OF THE MID XX CENTURY IN SPAIN AND IS A PRODUCT FOR IGNORANT TURISTS, no Paella made by a Valencian or any old school coock will have both seafood and meats.

 The footpump that comes with this ball is almost useless and very frustrating to use.   My Fitness Ball would not fully inflate.  I returned it 
 When will Disney ever learn that people could care less about Pan and Scan any more and that Widscreen editions are outselling 4:3 ratio by large margins. They could have at least provided both versions on one DVD. Top marks for this campy movie, zero stars for Disney 
 Warning, before reading this book make sure you are well schooled in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, US involvement with Somalia, the Persian Gulf War, and Islam. The more you know about these subjects the more you will realize that Bergen interjects his political opinions throughout the book with side comments; by selectively adding some facts and leaving out others; and by the clever arrangements of facts.  Bergen is biased against the US and eerily; the net affect is some sort of weird admiration for OBL.  Bergen falls for some of OBL's twisted, misrepresentation of the Koran. See page 99 and note the Bergen's equalization of the words infidel and idolater. He also defends OBL's rants against the US by clarifying for the reader that UN sanctions killed 500,000 Iraqi children. Of course Bergen leaves out Saddam Hussein's role in starving his own people.  Bergen's account of the murder of Abdullah Azzam (Bergen calls him OBL's mentor) follows right after discussion with former Pakistani Prime Minister so this arrangement implies that somehow they are connected. Other scholars suspect OBL of murdering Azzam. This Bergen ignores.  In his discussion of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan he spends all his time talking from the side of the rebels. He gives no background as to events leading up to it, nor the poor military practices in the Soviet army which contributed to its own defeat. The Soviet Union published an after action review, The Bear Went Over the Mountain, that points out individual combat leaders and mistakes they made that were grievous enough so that any band of rebels could have beaten them. Bergen only presents OBL view that he brought down a super power. He does mention the US made Stinger missile, but spends more time talking about how clumsy the US was to let some of these go unaccounted for; rather than mentioning that without the Stinger the Soviets would not have pulled out.  In Chapter 4, he mentions Desert Storm and out of left field adds the fact the Timothy McVeigh was one of the 500,000 US troops there. He adds that before 9-11 OK City was the worst terrorist activity in US. The subliminal message is US Army is an equivalent terrorist organization as Al-Qaeda. Later he outright says training in an Al-Qaeda camp is better that basic training in the Army.   In discussing Somalia, he makes sure the reader is aware George H Bush got US involved. He leaves out background information about the UN and Boutris Boutris Ghali role in tribal conflict. He claims at "least 500" Somalis died when more respected accounts put the number at 3000. He says US "tried" to capture and never mention they did capture two bad guys. In all he makes the US look foolish and A-Qaeda's cause of serious blow against US. He doesn't mention the decision by Les Aspin to hamper the mission by denying the US its own armor-protected vehicles.   While recounting OBL's case against the US (like the reader is suppose to take this seriously) he adds his opinion that for two thousand years Christians don't follow the teachings of Jesus.  I'm not half way through the book and I'm sorry I bought it.   I was hoping for a documented history about OBL. Instead I got the CNN view of the world - OBL is a deeply religious man, a great military leader, a successful businessman, and has a legitimate case against the US, which by default is guilty. 
 Mindless entertainment by definition. Doesn't create any empathy for the characters which is essential when telling a story. Unless of course you've got the IQ of a jar of mayo, then I guess you might be able to identify with one or more of the characters in this movie. Super lame premise and plot holes abound. It's just shy of delving into the cinema abyss that is Tony Scott film making. All style (poor style at that) no substance. The only thing that makes it worthy of 2 stars are a few mildly entertaining parts that border on the surreal and I won't tell you what those parts are and spoil it in the event you made the mistake of buying this movie. 
 Craig Fuller makes $3 million a year as chief of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. After perusing this tome, it is clear that writing lucid narrative prose is not part of his job description. Of course it is a typical Washington pretense to assume that every thought one has is profound and must be committed to print; after all, they're paying me three mil, so random musings that carom through my brainpan must be insightful!  Alas, as this embarrassing volume shows, this pretense is exactly that -- a pretense. This collection of cliches, shopworn positive thinking bromides, and other half-baked attempts at homey wisdom comes off as nothing but pure wind. Fuller makes no original observations about anything, though he certainly had ample opportunity to do so (Vioxx anyone?).  And so, let us please observe a moment of silence for the trees murdered so senselessly only so Fuller could commit his vacuous brain droppings to print. Indeed, the existence of this book is so tragic, and bodes so poorly for the future of Western civilization, that let us also say a silent prayer for the sacrifices of the ink and glue.  
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 I actually rate this book as absolutely ZERO stars.  There is ACCURATE information available 
 So much detail, so many acronyms, too much technical detail and rhetoric, not much action.   Bill Kurry 
 Sorry readers but slogging through this "tribute" to friendship was about as enjoyable as a root canal.  Where to begin? The first thing that comes to mind was "what a sick mess of a relationship".  You can sum it up in a nutshell something like this.  Lucy to Ann .... "You will, pay my bills, clean my pigsty of a house, do all my bidding however outrageous, lavish me with attention, declare your love.., in turn I will, ignore you at will, rarely deliver anything as promised, drop you for a better gig at a moments notice, take no responsibility for anything and use you for everything you've got... Ann to Lucy  "Yes pet!"  Lucy comes off as petty, self-absorbed, spoiled and plain obnoxious minus half a face or not.  Ann is a classic enabler, you can't help but pity her.  Like other reviewers I took issue with the author revealing every sordid detail about her dead friend while telling us nothing of her own shortcomings.  Although ultimately I suppose this novel itself speaks volumes about the author's many flaws 
 Steven Milloy is the self proclaimed "director" of The Advancement for Sound Science Coalition also known as TASSC. This coalition is a think tank for corporate interests. The objective of the TASSC is to debunk modern scientific research that concludes corporate pollution has serious consequences on he environment.  So Steven's objective is to discredit any scientific findings that come to the conclusion that corporate America's pollution has now and will continue to have global effects on the environment. So he criticizes the results of real scientists that are doing objective research and labels them as radical liberals. He calls their science "junk science" .  The only slip in reasoning here is that the scientists that conclude big business pollution is destructive to the environment and our health weren't paid by billion dollar Industries to come to these conclusions.  Steven Milloy and TASSC are funded gratuitously by corporate America to debunk global warming and any other scientific findings that run counter to corporate America's interests.  Originally TASSC was funded by Philip Morris with the goal of debunking the scientific conlusion that second hand smoke is hazardous to your health. Would you believe that? If I was paid a million dollars by Phillip Morris to say second hand smoke is not dangerous to your health would you believe me? I really hope not. But that is just what Steven Milloy does. He gets paid enormously by corporate America to say that environmental scientists (who weren't paid off to come to specific conclusions) are the one's producing the junk science. His original funding came from Phillip Morris but TASSC is funded by the following corporations: 3M, Amoco, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Motors, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lorillard Tobacco, Louisiana Chemical Association, National Pest Control Association, Occidental Petroleum, Philip Morris Companies, Procter & Gamble, Santa Fe Pacific Gold, and W.R. Grace, the asbestos and pesticide manufacturers.  If you think I'm making this all up do a Google search on "Steven J. Milloy Spin doctoring" or "Steven J. Milloy Phillip Morris" and see all of the legitimate resources that expose his true ulterior motives. That is, if you actually do care about the truth more than you care about not being labeled as a liberal radical.  The name calling is how these billion dollar corporations enforce compliance by labeling dissenters as deviants. If you care about the environment you are a bleeding heart liberal, if you don't support the United States occupation and Halliburton's profiteering in Iraq you are unpatriotic and sometimes even considered a terrorist. These God and Jesus spewing billionaires define right and wrong and what is moral according to their own interests. They will pay pseudo scientists like Steven J. Milloy enormous sums of money to make it appear that there is scientific evidence to support their agenda.   
 Batman has been a favorite of mine for many years, but I can only recommend this title to readers with a great deal of unsatisfied nostalgia for 70's-style comics.   If your aesthetics have grown with you since the 1970s, you might be disappointed with BATMAN: STRANGE APPARITIONS. Amongst the host of other Batman graphic novels and collections out there, you will find fare more deserving of your time and attention. 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 Do not buy this poor DVD. It is a waste of your money 
 This is probably the most amusing book of the USA trilogy, with a lot of sex and a certain amount of playfulness in the writing. Dos Passos is the kind of writer, however, who is often funnier when he is being scathing than when he trying to amuse. His politics are so badly dated that he often comes across as a reactionary pig just when he wants to be a revolutionary.   Case in point -- lovable Charley Anderson, the flyer who wants to become a captain of industry, is ultimately destroyed by his own lust, greed, and stupidity. Along the way, however, Dos Passon represents him as a "victim" of the rapacious Senator Planet, who is meant to be some sort of predatory aristocratic homosexual. The irony is that the mild, practically gallant flirtation the senator indulges in seems positively tame today, but Dos Passos sees it as The Ultimate Horror. Who coulda thunk that gay-bashing would go stale in just sixty years? Dos Passos sure didn't see it coming.   Other interesting thing, of course, is that Charley is the easy prey of his rich, cruel grasping wife. Some of their sex scenes are sexy, and the irony is that Gladys is a lot more of a feminist heroine than Mary French. When she doesn't want sex with Charley, she says so! I guess to dumb old Dos Passos it's only working men who have the right to go on strike.   By the same token, Margo Dowling, the luscious and high-spirited movie queen who makes it big in tinsel town, is actually quite a likeable charcter. But Dos Passos can't help taking digs at her first husband, a handsome Latino hunk who is -- guess what -- a gay man. Was there some kind of Latino self-loathing here? Dos Passos was a Portuguese, and not particularly masculine. Anyway, some of Margo and her husband's adventures are funny, but Dos Passos can't let them speak for themselves. He has to keep reminding you that handsome Ramon is a sissy -- like that justifies having him murdered off stage.   Read this book if you feel like a few cheap laughs on a man who outlived all his own ideas by a good thirty years. 
 I ususally enjoy Christina's books, however this book was very disappointing.  It lacks her usual commonsense approach to health and food and instead focuses one chapter on ancient chinese knowledge of the 5 elements applies this to food and modern day malady, and that is it.  The rest of the book is recipes, which I have noticed she tends to reuse in her other books.  This is the worst book out of her series, I reccomend skipping this one altogether and going for GLOW and cooking the whole foods wa 
 I had to quit reading this book approximately half way through because I had no interest whatsoever in continuing to read about these snobby, conceited and dull women.  Don't waste your time 
 Order was shipped very quickly.I will keep Item. Advertised hanging hardware and swivel not included. Chair could easily fray, cotten ends are only taped, not knotted. No way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised. I should have read advertisement closer. I could have gotten 100% cotten chair for less. This ad didn't state the material used. I could buy from this company again I'll just pay closer attention 
 What kind of an experiment was this cable watching thing supposed to be? The guy goes on a hike and imagines he comes back full of some eternal "wisdom" and then sits down and watches TV for 1700 hours straight, and comes to the conclusion that the 1700 hours of TV watching were not particularly rewarding...! give me a break! well duh-of course watching tv for a month straight isnt rewarding! Its amazing that people sit down and write big books making these sorts of obvious points. In the end mcKibben succeeds in shining a damning light on our culture - not through his "experiment" but by publishing the book. A culture, where people can pretend to be clever intellectuals by making the kind of social experiments and delvering the kind of half baked "insights" as McKibben does, is in serious, serious trouble 
 Reading this book was like drinking warm diet coke--flat and artifically sweet. Really just  a rehash of the Abraham Hicks/Law of Attraction materials, this books  fails to motivate or inspire. Between the plugs for the author's internet program and audio products there is just flat prose.  Even the sample meditation is uninspired.  The law of attraction has been addressed countless times and this book adds nothing to the mix. If you are seeking a thorough understanding of the law of attraction and techniques to assist you in its mastery, you would be better served by works by other authors, including Esther and Jerry Hicks, Lynn Grabhorn, Michael Losier and Joe Vitale. Avoid this tired retread 
 Buy this book at your peril. The author of this book has, it would appear, done alot of research and he wants you to know it. The book is difficult and language laborious. This might be an ok read for advanced sociologist but for your average computing proffessional or student of computing its a  waste of time 
 The play was relatively entertaining and has a promising beginning, but Higgins' infuriating and incesant bullying doesn't change, and quickly becomes tiresome. You keep expecting the characters to evolve, to grow into something better, or at least different, and none of them really do. Doolittle is still lazy, Pickering always the gentlemen, and most frustratingly, Eliza and Henry are never truly able to understand one another. In the beginning I was an immediate fan, but as the story continued I grew more and more dissatisfied, and by the end I felt that it was a complete waste of time 
 The book is somewhat entertaining, but reading it you realize that the author  doesn't know much about the subject. The part about 18 century was so unrealistic with things like lipstick, iced tea or bath tab, that I was really surprised the characters didn't use computers in that time period 
 I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this book.  The ads for it were so promising.  It's a terrible read, saturated with TMI in most cases (I don't care what lab did the research, and you don't need to keep reiterating it).  It preaches a hardcore opinion of the validity of the research, and then reveals nothing but open ended questions.  The book tells you how many entrepreneurs answered in what way, and the margin of difference is more often than not, miniscule.  
 Alan Deutschman writes in quintessential GQ style...Apple, Pixar, Next and Jobs are given the cinematic attention - Brioni suits and designer clothing take precedence to the story telling theme! That's precisely where the story ends - Neither Apple's business environment nor the facts behind Jobs renaissance garner attention! Steve's vendetta against the Apple board that sacked him, his bitterness about moving away from the company he helped create and his pre-occupation with Odwalla fruit juices/Black polo shirt & blue jeans are the only facets of Steve's character that Deutschman manages to grasp. (...) Steve's obsession with German design aesthetics, his "tomfoolery" with his corporate hobbies- Next, Pixar and Apple are all touted by Deuschman as tenets of a precipitous corporate personality! Jobs is portayed as a whip slashing mogul who just rides his "ill-deserved" luck to the top- He is credited with ZERO intelligence and a disgusting atttitude! Apparently, Next and Pixar had no strategies and were "bleeding,hemorrhaging corporations"- a phrase Deutschman uses with irritating regularity!  Job's groundbreaking strategies to rev up the motorcade of new products at Apple and Next are promptly thrown out of the window! His ability to turn small-door companies like Pixar into money making machines is rudely ignored. (...)This man hardly knows what he is talking about 
 I admit it, I thought the song 'Blurry' was an OK song for a post-grunge/wanabe-grunge band, and most of the other singles off 'Come Clean' were somewhat tolerable. However; when the local rockstations took it upon themselves to bombard us with 'She f--king Hates Meeee' 24/7, I realized just how mediocre they really were. Granted, I knew they weren't so great to begin with, but at least 'Blurry' was a somewhat tolerable Nevermind-derived song. But 'tolerable' isn't really saying much for their artistic ability of which they are obviously lacking.     When their next [and last? :)] album came out and the stations began to play 'Away From Me' it was clear just they were trying way too hard. All you need to hear is the first song, 'Away From Me' to realize that that's just where you should get from this band.    As far as sounding like Nirvana goes, Puddle of Mudd does not sound like them at all, what they sound like is a band blatently trying to rip-off Nirvana's style. That's what the fans hate, and that's why Puddle of Mudd will always be loathed by fans of grunge. They just try too hard. Especially if you look at their videos, of which I only remember seeing one and it was a long time ago, but so much of it, from the underwatery effect to the guy's hair just looked like a Nevermind-era rip off. If I hadn't known who they were beforehand I'd have thought it was a parody! [and a rather bad one at that, nowhere near as great as Weird Al].   Oh and one more thing before I end this, to that guy before me: for future reference, before you go and diss a band you obviously know nothing about, could you at least try and get some facts right? It was not '10-15' years ago, it was 12. And besides that, what exactly does that even have to do with anything? John Lennon died 26 years ago, should we care any less about him and his music as time goes by? Absolutely not. Death means nothing in the world of music, only that it lives on in the hearts and minds of fans everywhere. And lastly, yes you should hate Pepsi for tasting similar to Coke because it's obviously trying too hard to be Coke. :D  I will be very stunned if this band ever has a comeback and even more so if it's successful. I guess the record execs realized that emo was the new hip thing and ditched these guys faster than you can say My Chemical Romance. 
 This book is fairly basic.  You may instead browse internet and find some good advices on metrics and performance 
 Ahh, "Iron Eagle".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/"current" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.    The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base "network" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.  Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy. 
 PRODUCT IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH VIDEO IPODS.  THAT IS THE TARGET MARKET. SHOULD NOT BE SOLD 
 There are a ton of errors in this book (including listing Roland Hanna playing piano of Charles Mingus's Mingus ah Um, when it was actually Horace Parlan). Plus ALLMUSIC.COM will list a cd at 3 stars, and this book will list it at 5, and vice versa. The reviews are supposed to be in chronological order, but are frequently out of order. But THE MOST ANNOYING, is the enormous amount of 2 or 3 star reviews that end with, "essential music", "great music", "must have". Then the next review will be 5 stars and end with "not all that essential" or a causual "worth a listen". Buy music, not thi 
 This book is written by a woman who was sexually abused as a child and is now pushing the idea of sexuality between adults and children in order to justify her own pangs of guilt.  It is illegal and immoral to sexually abuse children.  Condoning such behavior, and certainly applauding it this blatantly, is shameful.  Certainly, if Ms. Levine had had any children herself, she would be writing with a very different perspective 
    I really got burned out on Star Wars novels because all of them, like this piece of book trash, is written by fan writers who have no clue what Star Wars is all about.  They just want to make money so that fan boy geeks with no life buy the books.   This book is well it reads like a Harold Robbins novel with poor dialoge and the author looks like she set the novel in the same vein as the 1977 Star Wars Holiday special, or the terrible Dark Hors Comics stories.  Rubbish 
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 Having read dozens of books on adoption and foster care, I was looking forward to this book.  While some of the ideas were compelling, I found the tone to be too aggressive and some of the facts misleading.  I would not recommend this book 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 The 1st "movie": Fist of Fear, Touch of Death is so bad I didn't even watch the next 2. The uninitiated will possibly not know that the footage that purports to be about Bruce's life,  family and ancestry is all rubbish and was actually taken from 2 different movies: The ancestors "cuts" in color are from a colossally poor period piece that would be funny if it didn't seem to be taking itself seriously. While the black and white parents-and-family "cuts" actually are truly a young Bruce in a Hong Kong film that he made before returning to the U.S. to live. However the scenario is totally misrepresented. All of the other participants are actors as well and not correctly identified. Nor is the dubbed dialog related to what is really being spoken (in Cantonese) by the actors. Yet a third source is tapped for the "supposed interviews" which are not with the speaker at all, but with someone else regarding the work Bruce did on the "Longstreet" TV show in '71 and once again the voice-over not only is not really Bruce and is again, not accurate (and he was speaking English during those interviews). One would be better served to buy the "Legend" DVD from the -Bruce Lee Master Collection- or the more recent "Bruce Lee: The Warrior's Journey" to see and hear in Bruce's own words and voice what the NON-"What's Up Tiger-Lily" version is of the early Hong Kong (black and white) and what the "Longstreet" interviews have to reveal about him.  If this is meant to be a spoof and they just forgot to mention that anywhere, then shame on them. I don't find it even remotely humorous, not to consider the generations of people who might not know any better since his untimely death 32 years ago.   
 "The Golden Bowl" (1904), written by Henry James (1843 -1916), is a book that many consider a classic. I read it many years ago, and decided to read it again after hearing a friend mention it, and realizing I didnt remember much about its plot.  The story is set in England, and its main characters are Prince Amerigo, Maggie Verver and her father Adam, and Charlotte Stant, Maggies best friend. Amerigo is an Italian nobleman that happens to be poor, and decides to marry the very rich Maggie in order to become wealthy. Maggie has a very close relationship with her father, and decides that Adam should marry Charlotte, so that he wont be alone. What Maggie doesnt know, however, is that Amerigo was the lover of her friend Charlotte. That seemingly small detail, that Amerigo and Charlotte go to great lenghts to hide, complicates the relationships of the four characters, and immerses them in a web of lies and simulation. Appearances and reality, what is more important? And what doesn a golden bowl have to do with all that?  If you are interested in finding the answer to those questions, and dont mind the fact that James style is somewhat baroque in this book, you might be interested in reading "The Golden Bowl". The descriptions are great, and the author excels at making you understand what these couples are thinking, and feeling. On the other hand, not much happens, and this is the kind of book that can be easily forgotten. That is what already happened to me once, and it is likely to happen again, at least to me. I dont recommend "The golden bowl", due to the fact that there are other books out there that are unforgettable, books that simply make you remember them...  Belen Alcat  PS: If you are interested in reading this book, please do so. "The golden bowl" was not for me, but maybe you will understand and appreciate it better 
 Very complicated book. Bad examples and format. AN FYI for college students trying to save money, the older edition is the SAME as the newest one. What a rip off. 
 There is nothing of interest in this book. Read the Amazon and Publishers Weekly reviews - they politely explain how little of the content is either new or tells you anything significant about John Lennon. If you buy it you are only providing more money to a very rich talentless person who has parasited the memory of JL for 25 years 
 this book doesn't even deserve 1 star! i would give it a negative number of stars if i could! this book is awful! i read fifty pages and couldn't take it any more! the caracters are unoriginal! the plot is a cheap wannabe of something great that leaves you feeling like an easily amused simpleton for attempting to read it in the first place!!! honestly if you want to read some good, fullfilling fantasy, read something with a little depth to it read something good like 'Lord of the Rings' or 'the firebringer trilogy' or 'the Bartimaeus Trilogy' at least they have something original to them! 
 There's isn't much of a story to this repetitive book.  Sure, there's lots of animals in this zoo and they all 'look back' at the main character after she looks at them, but it's not enough to make it interesting.  My 2 and 4  year old weren't impressed and they LOVE books 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 They would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken 
 Chapter 2 in the book is EXCELLENT.  Step by step on how to install and setting up and project.  After setting up everything from chapter 2, when you start learning Hibernate, this is what you're going to get: 1. Examples in the book do not match the code 2. The codes aren't complete 3. Authors walk you all over the place.  You'll get even more confused after reading this book 4. Sample codes in the book aren't clear  My opinion: I think the authors wrote this book while doing something else.  The ideas are not focus 
 At first glance, the book seems to be nicely organized, with month-by-month information for various types of plants/tasks.  However, finding information about a particular plant can be frustrating, as the index is inadequate, and not detailed enough.  For example, the index for azaleas contains a list of 27 different page numbers, which are not sub-indexed.  This group of 27 pages actually covers a large section of azaleas as houseplants, and azaleas as shrubs.  It would have been easier to find the information I was looking for if the index had listed "azaleas: houseplants" and then "azaleas: shrubs".  Other plants suffer similar indexing fates.    Another gripe is the lack of any easily found index information for pests or for weeds.  I recently moved from the West coast, and have found that most of the pests and weeds are completely different.  In fact, I have no idea what a "chinch bug" looks like, and this book leaves me in complete ignorance.  The book mentions a chinch bug several times, but nowhere is there a picture, nor can I find chinch bug in the index.  Likewise, I cannot find a picture of, for example, nutgrass.  Nutgrass is mentioned a few times, but alas, this book fails to  help me learn how to identify it.  Overall, I am truly sorry that I spent money on this book.    
 It has been 15 years since I last shopped for a stereo receiver, and back then there were certain features that all receivers came with, regardless of how basic or inexpensive the model was.  Well, I took for granted that they all still came with these basic features, and I was wrong.  I just purchased the Sherwood RX-4105, and it does not have the tape monitoring feature.  It has tape input and output jacks, but it doesn't have the monitoring feature that lets you listen to the tape deck's output while you are recording.  If you press the tape button, the receiver switches away from the input source you are trying to record from!  The tape monitor function is also necessary for the use of an equalizer.  It baffles me that they are still giving you tape in and out jacks, but don't give you the proper switching for monitoring.  I guess they figured they could save a few pennies by leaving out this function, since the demand for tape decks has declined in recent years.  Unfortunately, there are those of us who still like to use an EQ to customize the sound to our environment, even if we are no longer recording on tape.  I have found it difficult to verify whether or not a receiver has this function, since the specs and features list usually never mentions it.  If they have a good picture of the unit, you can look to see if there is a button that says "tape monitor."  Just looking for tape in and out jacks will not help, because as I mentioned above, the RX-4105 has these jacks, but no monitor function.  Then there are some models that have monitoring even though the switch only says "tape."  The best way to know for sure is to try out the unit first, but this is not practical when shopping online.  I have even gone so far as to go to the manufacturer's website and download the instruction manual.  If the section on tape connections and recording doesn't mention "monitoring," it probably doesn't have it.  Also, many models no longer have phono input, but this is easy to check just by looking at a good picture of the unit.  The RX-4105 also lacks an auxillary AC jack on the back of the unit; not a big deal, but a consideration if you have an outlet strip already filled up by other components. Another thing I noted that is worth mentioning is that many newer models such as this one have volume control knobs that do not have any position indicators or scale markings on them; so be sure to turn down the volume before you turn off the unit, or you could be in for a surprise when you turn it back on again!  If you don't intend to use an EQ, and don't need phono input, the RX-4105 is probably a good inexpensive starter model.  The sound seemed fine, and it had plenty of power for my application.  The tuner did seem to have a weak sensitivity; some local FM stations came in with a lot of static.    In my research I have found the TEAC models RV-S2100 and AG-790, as well as Onkyo models TX-8011 and TX-8211 all have tape monitoring capabilities as well as phono input. 
 Picked these up last night and they really sound bad. There seems to be a lot of artifacts in the sound from the digital signal processing. Also, they recommend you not separate the speakers by more than 24".  That's hard with a large monitor.  The quality of materials is top notch though.  I expected allot better sound quality from Bose, especially considering the price.  Listening to one of my favorite CDs for about five minutes over them actually made me nauseous.  I returned them to the store this morning for a full refund.      
 The best thing about this book for me was that it was so short.  I really don't think I could have finished if it were any longer.  I just don't get it.  I found the book to be so simple that it was insulting.  I felt like I should have read this at about 10 years of age.  Profound? Hardly. Masterpiece? Certainly not.  The only impact that this book had on me was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about... and I am still working on that one 
 I am giving Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock a single star because it has been revered as "the" book on this master director for way too long.   I first read this book years ago as a new student of film and Hitchcock.  Since that time I have read lots more about Hitchcock and with each new piece of the puzzle, have determined after re-reading it recently that there is little that is new or exclusive to this book.  Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago.  The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer.  This book merely provides what Hitchcock wanted to say of himself, the packaged image, just like his famous caricature.  There are many other books to choose from which offer a more complete portrait.  Seek them out .. 
 I am definitely an admirer of Bobbi Brown, whose lovely makeup designs can actually be worn by real women in real life.  Her book "Bobbi Brown Beauty" is one of my favorites.  However, much of the advice in that book is repeated in this one.  There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life.  However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication.  I would only purchase this book at a bargain price 
 This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel 
 Thanks God that the phone can survive a moderate fall.  The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case, its all loose after that.  Another disappointment, the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing, again you guessed it, falls.  
 I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example 
 Robert Massie has spent execptional amounts of time for over 30 years flaying this dead horse about the Romanvos. He has all ways been dead wrong with any of his "findings".  As any /every one knows, history is a fairy tale, slanted by the winning side. Russians are incapable of telling the truth. The British are not known as exceptionally truthful. There are legions of individuals both directly involved and peripherally involved with the "fate" of the Romanovs, but none will band together and state the facts. TOO, too ridiculous, with Massie acting like Moses coming down from the Mount. Hey, Bob, after all, it is ONLY your version of the facts.   His "research" is sloppy, he relies on dubious sources. He violates all the basic tenets of factual, honest journalism.   By all means, AVOID any and all books with Massie's name on them. Total waste of time, effort, ink, paper and money. He should have quit with "Nicholas & Alexandra", so long ago 
 Wow, I sampled the songs on this new CD and I really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness Sting used to bring to the music.  Like DeNiro and Pacino.  Where are they now?  Doing comedy and bland movies.  Not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch.  Stings voice is still among the best in the world, just the music behind him is what makes his CDs bland and uninteresting.  I mean, Techno and Rap.  It's like a mundane chant, much like the Sting of the past used to sing out about.  It looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it's also consuming those that used to be the best.  It's really a shame to see an artist like Sting decline in his work.  Brand New Day was the start.  Although it wasn't all bad, but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style.  Oh, well, albums like "Ten Summoner's Tale", "Nothing Like the Sun", "Soul Cages", and "Dream of the Blue Turtles" were the best of his solo career.  Now, he's just earning a paycheck.  Farewell Sting.  It was nice knowing you 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 I do not know why he decided to recycle his "Long Term Secrets to Short Term Trading" book. He is selling the same old stuff in a new book with a different name. Even the examples and the explanations of his setups are word to word the same. Nothing new at all. No need to buy the book 
   I can honestly say that the D20 Modern is a playable system. There are several key oversites in the engine. With the introduction of an entirely new wealth system (purchase DC) the authors have sidestepped the complicated issues of dealing with a credit system. While this has it's advantages for the game designers, it has left players who wish to deal on a cash basis entirely out of luck. There are no real world prices listed in this book, or the supliments for d20 modern. This means that players wishing to work with a traditional money system are faced with creating their own prices. There is a conversion table listed in the book, but this table is broad in it's range.  There are several other issues within this slight deviation of the standard D20 system that leave the player fealing like they have purchase a watered down version of Cyberpunk. All in all, the system is still very playable but I am certain that many more in house rules will be in effect where D20 modern is being played 
 This book was written in 1997, before Brockman honed her storytelling skills to the high level they are today.  The characters are one-dimensional, the plot simplistic, and the book is just plain boring.  There are a few hints of the excellent writer that Brockman will become, but there are not enough of them to make reading this book worthwhile 
 I bought this book as I was interested in simulating in simprocess. The book is not useful at all neither for an experienced modeller, nor for a beginner. This is of no use for a practical modeller, theoreist or student.  It is more of an entertainment kind of book with very generalistic sporadic examples about where simulation application was successful and funny pictures, double space 16 font text with no content.   For beginners, one should rather buy "Business Process Simulation" by Laguna, which also has a student version of soft. One can go through simulation examples and learn a lot. (I bought this two books together)   In general, if you want to waist your time and money, and read something in half an hour and learn nothing, buy it. But but  does it make sense to pay for nothing and make the authors rich just because they are from GACI or Ernst and Young consultancy. Bad use of their brand to promote the sales of the bad book (but probably not so bad software 
 The advice Rand gives writers in this transcription of a series of living room lectures is sound in places: anchor your abstractions in the concrete; remember that art is selectivity; show, don't tell; use actions to illuminate your character, etc, etc, etc. All good advice, to be sure, but to say that Rand is proposing anything new or different from what is taught in writing seminars across the country is a little disingenuous. Add to this her refusal to praise the work of any author besides herself and Victor Hugo, her casual dismissal of prominent writers without convincing evidence (and, even more interesting, the relative paucity of authors she even brings up) and a few didactic guidelines (her ban on profanity, slang, and references less than one century old), and there's rather too much extraneous stuff here to be worth the effort of wading in to try to get to the good bits.  If it's advice you're looking for, there's an excellent essay called "Dogma" in "The Writing Life," a collection of essays and interviews with a number of authors put together by the National Book Award that I found both more helpful and less self-absorbed 
 I got one word: RETARDED. It fits this album and also every one of the reviewers here, that gave this bs more than one star. 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 There's no effort to hide the fact that this book is basic, but perhaps it's too basic. The authors scurry through the full set of design principles, but often move too fast and touch too superficially to allow for real learning. Deeper analysis of the basics, substituting thoughtful examples and exercises for the many one-liners, would make this more helpful. On the other hand, it's probably useful for the part-time desktop publisher who needs to browse three "sample brochures" before four p.m. and couldn't care less about theory 
 The worst thing that the 60's produced is Roger Kimball. Yes, that's right. He was around then you know. He wan't visiting some other planet. He is more of a product of the 60's than the people he writes about.  But he never tells us why he had such a toxic reaction. Where does this all come from? What motivated him to put together his grab bag of stuffy attitudes and procede to pontificate for the next however many years. And this is important because, let's face it, attitude is all he ever shows us. There's nothing deep or really clever here 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 This book provides more confusion and frustration to a student than anything.  It ceases to offer sufficient example problems, while the few problems that do exist pertain to the less important theory.  Also, the  text provides a lack of explaination as to where it gets its values for  constants - nearly all chapter problems require the utilization of some  type of constant, yet the book has no tables of these values.  I actually  had to refer to my thermodynamics text in order to finish the questions  from this book.  It almost seems as if the book was rushed, since it  doesn't explain or justify anything. Finally, I would like to mention that  this was the most expensive of all my texts.  I regret purchasing this  text, as I could have learned more about fluid mechanics in my bathtub than  from this book 
 Usually I am a "Happy Consumer"... NOT THIS TIME. My 13 month daughter loves flap books and loves to sit quietly and flip through books. This book left a DEEP paper cut on my child's thumb and blood all over book!!!!!!! Although she did not cry, I was horrified!!!!! Parents beware! Do yourself a favor and buy books that have the thicker pages/ flaps for this age group. Be sure to inspect books like this for sharp edges 
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. Having said that I did not like this book:  1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point.   2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story.   3) who were all the pictures of? i found them distracting...   i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette 
 There is no royal road to Hegel. This book was written by a political scientist, not a philosopher--and it shows. A reviewer above said that one who wants to avoid Hegel's technical terminology should read this book. Patten not only avoids Hegel's technical terminology, he shows no signs of understanding it. There is no substitute for reading Hegel himself. But if you _must_ read Hegel through a secondary source, get Peperzak's Modern Freedom. Save up because it's expensive 
 As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening. 
 The erotic content was on the level of jerking off into a test tube - never thought I'd find the sight of a woman masturbating so uninteresting 
 The main reason I ordered this kit was for the battery.  When I received it ....NO BATTERY included.  I contacted Amazon and all they could do was give me a number for Sony customer service.  Thanks Amazon!! 
 I was extremely disappointed in Dan's book. Really, it was pages and pages of reference to his website, where, in the book, he tells you that you can go to find valuable information. When you go to the site, you find that the "valuable" information is just that--valuable (highly priced). This book is nothing more than a sales pitch. Its amazing that someone can sell a book that is really just a sales pitch for high priced seminars and pricey information 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 This book of short stories and poems by Edgar Allan poe is very confusing. I would only suggest this book to an adult of teenager with an extremely wide vocabulary. I'm in middle school and I didn't really undrestand some of the stories. If you are into bazzar and weird things then this is the book for you. don't get me wrong Edgar Allan Poe is an awsome writer but the book is a little confusing. Be sure to make the right choice on this book 
 I agree with Jeff.  The overuse of the "N" word was unnecessary and racist, and Ruth Yancey Fox ruining life after life for over 300 pages was just about too much to endure 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 What happend to the firehouse of the early 90s?  This group went from a once hard rocking band to putting out shlock like Category 5.  If you are thinking about buying this because you enjoyed their earlier albums, be prepared to be dissapointed.  It's a bunch of mellow rock that I would expect to hear on a radio station in a dentist's office.  A station that plays Phil Collins, Sheryl Crow, and Bryan Adams 
 OK, I figure if you're looking at this CD, you're a Laurie Anderson fan and can recall at least twice you've seen her great concert movie, likely at a midnight showing back in the 80's.  Well, if you're that person, avoid the utter heartbreak which is this CD.  I counted 18 tracks from my old VHS copy of this concert, while only 8 made it to the CD.  The banter between tracks is omitted entirely.  The tracks are out of order (OK, small nitpick), and it's certainly not worth the effort.  I'm sorry, Laurie, but Warner scr-wed you hard on this one.  On the up side, the sound quality is good, certainly better than my VHS.  But hey, this is a concert film soundtrack, but apparently they forgot to include the second disk.  Laurie fans will be livid.  (Others merely confused!  : 
 As I write this review, it was 5 years ago this very day that the Walt Disney Co. released the classic "Fantasia" for the first time on DVD as a 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  But exactly 5 years later, you can no longer purchase a legitimate, new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price, via such avenues as ebay.  As a Disney shareholder, I am one unhappy camper!!  This is the only reason I'm rating this classic 5-star film with only 2 stars.  The DVD is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least $40 or $50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under $30 (and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by).  I'm sure I'm not the only consumer that's really sick and tired of Disney's inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their DVD releases.  So what am I supposed to do now?  Wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this DVD when Disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again?  I think not!  I can't wait that long, and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point.  Or, should I instead pay an insane price now for an original copy (the profits of which WILL NOT go to Disney)?  Again, I don't think so!  I do not believe in getting ripped off, and refuse to support those that profit from it, regardless of supply/demand fundamentals.  If Disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on DVD after only 2 to 3 years of availability, it shouldn't surprise them at all that they're actually LOSING POTENTIAL SALES to counterfeit/pirated versions of the films that are being sold around the world (and from auction sites like ebay, too).  The way I see it, THEY ASKED FOR IT!!  By not making these classics legitimately available at all times, they are encouraging piracy.  It's that simple, and they deserve it!!  In this day and age, people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want NOW!!  I guess Disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper DVD version of the original "Fantasia" just so I can show this classic to my nieces and nephews.  I'd much rather buy a legitimate copy that's reasonably priced, but I can't because Disney won't allow me to do so.  Oh well, it's their loss.  A classic film like "Fantasia", which came in at No. 58 on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time, deserves a far better fate than this.   Great job Disney!!  Way to go! 
 I was sucked into "playing" this a few years ago at a retreat weekend.  It was the only "game" that still had all its pieces.  After having experienced it, I know why.  It never stayed out of the box long enough to lose its bits.  Now, granted, I'm not an overly communicative type of guy.  But I enjoy games, and when my talkative friends wanted to play, I was willing to give it a shot.  By 5 minutes into it, even they were bored and were looking for excuses to leave.  We moved on from pretending to go around the pointless board to just rifling through the questions for any good ones.  The whole experience lasted all of ten minutes before we put it away.  I've played fun communication games.  There is a point and a purpose in playing those games:  You can win.  There is no win scenario in this "game".  Did War Games and WOPR teach us nothing?  If there is no winner, what's the point in playing 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
     This vacuum cleaner has been junk from day one. Poor quality accessories that broke easily and were expensive to replace, retractable cord that rarely retracts. All this, and it barely cleans anything. Don't buy it. The folks at Hoover should be ashamed of themselves 
 I knew going in that this would not have much use for me... that's okay, one tidbit of information could pay for the book many times over.  What i got was a rehash of the now ancient history (2003) versions of Amazon Web Services, and nothing useful from a pratical standpoint.   I didn't expect to use the programing stuff (non outdate), but thought the author might throw in at least one example of someone useing this goldmine for a functioning task.  I'm giving a 2 stars because it doesn't have some of the promised programing discussion, but recomend anyone looking to market books, etc to avoid this one 
 Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on "customer service", but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the "help area". I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all 
 Perhaps my expectations were too high?  Martha produces a beautiful magazine and her new Best of Weddings book is superb so I thought that this book, although older, would be a nice addition.  I was disappointed.  Although the book was published in 1999, it seemed even more outdated than that.  The flowers used seemed repeated over and over again and the book was centered completely around the varieties in Martha's garden. For a more thorough view, I'd like to recommend 2 books in place of this one.  Jane Packer's Fast Flower Arranging is fantastic and shows beautiful arrangements that can be made quickly even by a novice.  For actual, technical "how to" steps and design theory, I'd recommend Judith Blacklock's "Flower Arranging" (might be called Teach Yourself Flower Arranging in some indexes).  Once you know proper floral design techniques, you can use any kind of flowers (NOT just those from Martha's garden) to create beautiful arrangements 
 I have taught computer applications such as Word, Excel, and Project for many years, but I rarely touch programming languages. This book appeared to be a solid fit: Build a Program Now! However, I simply couldn't connect with the author's style. The author seems to spend an entire page writing about a concept that could have been explained in a paragraph, but topics and code snippets that needed explanation were skipped completely. I have a hunch that Pelland had the perspective of, "Don't kill the newbie reader with crazy terminology; just tell them what to type." The end result, however, is code that works, but how & why it actually works is a Masonic secret. I would have REALLY benefited from an approach such as, "OK morons, here's a six line program that will add two numbers, and show the answer in a Message Box. Notice Line 1 does this. Line 2 creates a variable that does that. Line 3 uses the 'Show' command to blah blah." There was one section that had over 60 lines of code with virtually none of it described or defined. In short, I learned a few things, but the time was not spent well. I gave up about half way through the book after my ego required hospitalization 
 This book applies to women who are in leadership positions, which I am not, so I despise the title "Nine Secrets Every Working Woman Must Know". It's misleading. I'm currently reading this book and have only found a small paragraph that applies to "every working woman." Given the title, I thought the book would give helpful tips on getting ahead for the average working woman, but it doesn't. Needless to say, it didn't do me much good for where I am currently in my career. 
 Half of the product came with mold growing on it.  The other half tasted so artifical that we just threw it out 
 King Alan is my favorite man in Washington.  I know I am not alone here.  But this book was not what I had hoped it would be.  There are a lot of quotes and brief comments on each.  Most of the book is about regulations  and banking, not on the markets.  In a couple of months the market  information will be outdated.  There is some interesting insite into the  1998 crisis, but that only covers a few pages.  The juicy quotes are pretty  far between.  I did not learn too much about Greenspan or his effect here 
 On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent. 
 I read the enthusiatic reviews before buying this cookbook.  I was disappointed.  First of all, the recipes are very difficult and time-consuming. It would help to have a staff of kitchen help to do all the required prep. Secondly, the presentation is lacking. But the worst problem of all is the exotic ingredients called for.  It seems that every other recipe requires "kombu" which is apparently some kind of seaweed.  I searched high and low and checked out every oriental market in town, to no avail.  Nobody knew what I was talking about!  I still don't know what kombu is.  Similarly, many other ingredients are generally unavailable.  Maybe these things would be easier to find on the West Coast where there is a large Asian population, but you just can't get them in Texas.  All that said, I did have some very delicious results on the "Acorn Squash stuffed with sweet rice."  I only had to make a few substitutions.. 
 Starting off with the premise that this book is a review of the lives of the 200 children born of Nobel prize winning sperm donors is completely misleading to the reader.  It has been a long time since I actually felt lied to in the preamble to purchasing a book.  Readers should know that no children are born of Nobel prize winners, no examination of the lives of 200 sperm donors from the bank is undertaken and no scientific information on genetics are even discussed throughout the whole book.  In fact, even the data collection of the few lives the author does research seems adhoc at best. What this book is about is a look at some kids who find their true fathers through the help of the author, but more so through a Canadian director researching the same topic for a movie documentary.  The author seems to ride on the coattails of this director in finding out a lot of his information.  All the while he makes enormously ridiculous comments and judgments about the supposed Nobel prize winning sperm bank and genetics.  He never once looks at the topic with an open mind, that maybe, just maybe extremely bright parents might be more likely to have extremely bright children. He does some good research in unraveling the Nobel sperm bank and the people behind it.  But it seems he relies on old interviews and tv show spots from the 70s and 80s, a time when these topics of genetics and race and IQ were strictly taboo.   The book feels to me that it was trying to use the hype around a Nobel prize winning sperm bank to create a marketing buzz when infact this book is nothing but a review of what could be any sperm bank and any children born of it.  Quite disappointing. 
 I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer. I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago.  I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm.  Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie 
 Kelly advertizes himself as a "student" of Frank Frazetta, but he hasn't learned anything except how to imitate the master.  Stiff, uninvolving, poorly designed, lifeless figures go through boring rehashes of Frazetta motifs.  If a student showed me this work, I'd encourage him to keep going in the hope that he might eventually find his own style.  He once did a Famous Monsters of Filmland cover that wasn't too bad, because he was copying from  photographs.  Boris is another one that has built a career scavenging from Frazetta, but at least he has slick craftmanship.  Kelly is an incompetent draughtsman and his compositions are awkward.  Did his family connections get him this book?  Sorry to sound harsh, but this stuff is junior league 
 Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.    Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.  Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.  And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.  It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.   * Recently reprinted and highly recommended!  
 OK. I have to separate my opinion of Ms. McKay - she is a brat - with her musical ability. She is a good instrumental musician. She doesn't blow me away. Her approach to music, and near about everything else from what I can gather, is 'I like what I'm doing and that's the only opinion that counts.' OK. If you're not on a major label, yeah. If you don't care if people listen, yeah. But she IS on a major label, and she DOES care if people listen or she wouldn't be so stridently 'in your face' about her opinions. This goes back to 'she is a brat.' And unfortuantely, that spills over into her music in ways that are extremely off-putting to me.  This record sounds great from a recording standpoint, but anyone can make a good-sounding record. However, it's so calculated that it has no real soul. It's more a commentary on McKay than it is on anything else. If she could rein in her ego and attitude, she might make a good session player, but if I never heard her sing another song she wrote, my heart wouldn't break. Perhaps the critics like her little schtick, but to me, it only reveals her immaturity. There are far better artists out there with less attitude and more ability. This record is as off-putting as her bratty attitude about nearly everything, as evidenced by the interviews she gives. I wouldn't waste my money on this one 
 In reviewing the music, I found that this is not the same Rip, Rig and Panic from 1982.  I cannot find any recordings from then. Where is that music 
 This book's title shows that "qualitative research" is its primary subject, and "developing grounded theory" is its secondary subject. The opposite is true in the case of the book coauthored earlier by Strauss: "The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research." In the interval between the writing of the two books, Strauss may have realized that his thesis was about research work more than theory construction. But the text of this second book too presents research work as theory construction, as explained below. It could be thought that what is to be called a "theory" is a linguistic issue. But the definition of this term must not prevent the construction of real theories as distinct from empirical knowledge.  In lieu of  the implicit definition of "theory" that appeared in the earlier book (p. 1), an explicit one is given in this second book: "A set of well developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena" (p. 15). The new and critical but obscure expressions in this definition are "well developed concepts" and "integrated framework," whereas the idea of explaining or predicting phenomena by using a theory appeared also in the earlier definition. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier book, explaining or predicting phenomena can be done by using empirical knowledge too and therefore cannot be considered a distinguishing characteristic of theories. For example, the empirical laws of electromagnetism known before Maxwell served to explain, predict, and control many electromagnetic phenomena but did not constitute a theory. The authors repeat the same mistake when they admit that "a theory is more than a set of [empirical] findings;" and continue by saying, "it offers an explanation of phenomena" (p.22). They also say, "generating theories about phenomena, rather than just generating a set of findings, is important to the development of a field of knowledge" (pp. 22-23). That is correct, but the problem is to know how theories are generated. Also, "findings" too serve to explain phenomena, as mentioned, although they have a narrower scope than theories.      "Statements of relationship [between phenomena] are commonly referred to as `hypotheses'" (p. 103). "Any hypotheses and propositions derived from data must be continuously `checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary" (p. 22). The key concept here, which the authors do not clarify sufficiently, is the derivation of hypotheses from data. First, some relationships between phenomena can be deduced from the data. But what is thus produced constitutes not a hypothesis but empirical knowledge about those phenomena. It is when those relationships are "generalized through induction," in Newton's words, that they become general rules which are of hypothetical nature, or hypotheses, because induction yields only probabilities, not certainties, as Bertrand Russell emphasized. The authors seem to ignore this fact. Moreover, when the hypotheses thus derived from data are "continuously `checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary" and those that are conserved are finally supported by all new information, they stop being hypotheses and become empirically known facts. And any set of such facts constitutes empirical knowledge, not a theory.  The authors seem not to have a clear view of where induction and deduction are used. "Anytime a researcher derives hypotheses from data, because it involves interpretation, we consider that a deductive process" (p. 22). A relationship that is deduced from the data related to some singular phenomena constitutes empirical knowledge about those phenomena. A hypothesis is created out of that knowledge when it is "generalized through induction." The total process is not only deduction but involves also  induction. The authors express these facts in an obscure way thus: "At the heart of theorizing lies the interplay of making inductions (deriving concepts, their properties, and dimensions from data) and deductions (hypothesizing about the relationships between concepts, the relationships also are derived from data, but data that have been abstracted by the analyst from the raw data)" (p. 22). What the authors unclearly describe as "abstracted by the analyst from the raw data" is what Newton meant by the words "generalized through induction." And the generalization must cover phenomena that do not allow the deduction of the hypothesis from the data if the hypothesis is expected to be used to construct a theory. The authors conclude: "At the end, it is hoped, the researcher has systematically developed the products of analysis into a theory" (p. 22). The major mistake in this conception of theory construction is that it ignores the following fact: A hypothesis that is "checked out against incoming data," (i.e. fits the data, is deducible from the data) is no more a hypothesis but empirical knowledge and therefore a system of statements only such hypotheses constitutes not a theory but a group of empirical knowledge. The authors repeat the same mistake when they say that a theory "is validated during the actual research process" (213). What can be validated during the "actual" (original) research process is empirical knowledge. A second phase of research is concerned with the validation of the theory, i.e. with showing that the consequences of the theory fit the phenomena, or that they are deducible not only from the theory but also from the phenomena. Consequently, the theory becomes usable in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.   Only when knowledge that is deduced, or readily obtained, from the raw data related to some singular phenomena is "generalized through induction" and assumed, or hypothesized, to be valid also in relation to phenomena that do not make possible the deduction of that hypothesis from the data that a hypothesis is created that can be used to construct a theory. This means that a theory contains at least one hypothesis that cannot be deduced from the empirical data related to all phenomena to which it is assumed to apply. The reason for this is that a law of nature may be deduced from the data related to some phenomena but not from the data related to other phenomena. Consequently, by transferring knowledge from one set of phenomena to another can provide hypothetical knowledge that is otherwise unavailable. A theory is a set of general statements, or laws, of which at least one is such a non-testable hypothesis at the time of the construction of the theory. After a theory is thus constructed, consequences are deduced from it that serve to explain, predict, and control the related phenomena. The usefulness of a theory in doing these things constitutes the proof of its usability and also the proofs of all of its contents, including the non-testable hypothesis, or hypotheses. When phenomena that do not fit a tested and accepted theory are encountered, a more general theory is constructed. The old theory is not discarded by being considered wrong but remains in use in the area where it is valid, because it is simpler than the more general theory.  The above-presented knowledge about the content and the method of construction of theories is derived from the grand theories of physics. I have shown in my books how the same method can be used in psychology too. As an example, I constructed a theory of automatic responses such as the symptoms of non-organic mental disorders, dreams, cerebral lateralization as structural response, etc. This theory serves not only to explain and predict those phenomena but also to control them very effectively where this is possible. I had to mention these here because the best test of ideas is their usefulness in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.  Although Strauss and Corbin advocate what they call "grounded theory," which is in reality nothing else than empirical knowledge, they expose their distrust of their work, which contains many unclear points, when they warn the reader by saying, "Remember that a theory is just that - a theory" (p. 213). Theories inspire more respect when their method of construction and their function are better understood.   
 Mr. Brooks talks about achieving instant rapport with someone.  Although this book talks about the very basics of NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) since it has been written in 1989 when NLP was fairly new, there are couple of basic stradegies I found useful:  1.  Talking in forms of the other's representation types (Visual, Kinesthetic, Auditory) We are either one of the three types, and we tend to talk more in types of those languages.  (ex.  I "see" what you mean vs. I "hear" what you mean)  Simply recongnize them in a conversation and talk in that context of language.  2.  Mirroring  In order to establish rapport, subtly mirror their physical behaviors (ex. hand gestures, crossing legs)   3.  Anchoring When someone is in high emotional state, anchor that feeling by planting a signal on his/her body (squeezeing elbows, wrist)   Other methods Brooks talks about did not seem very practical to me (such as using specific questions such as "Can you remember a time when you have been totally attracted to someone?" leading to "What was the first thing you noticed, looks, sound, or feeling?" to "What was the second thing you noticed..." to "What was the third?" to supposedly tap into someone's minds.  Seems kind of impractical to use in a conversational context because nobody talks like this and the subject is likely to feel strange.  Overall, gives you a gist of the world of NLP, which can be a very powerful tool if studied carefully. However, there are other more modern books out on NLP now since studies have advanced.  If interested, check out Tony Robbins' Unlimited Power if you want to learn how to control your mind and feelings as well as rapport with others in greater detail.  
 I was excited to finally get this book in the mail, but I felt unmoved after I looked through it. I sat and read through it all in one sitting like I did with the first book, but it felt as though everything was rushed. The book was lacking in variety and seemed almost repetetive. Some of the secrets really touched me (don't get me wrong), but the overall impact of the book was lukewarm at best. If you haven't yet, I would suggest reading the first book over this one 
 The very concept of this book is deeply offensive to anyone who values freedom of speech and thought, or good writing.  Don't these people realize that they are engaging in intentional brainwashing?  You can't change reality by changing the words; you have to change it by changing the reality.  Resist these intellectual totalitarians at every opportunity!  Use (and treasure) precise, vigorous language, eschew emasculated, politically correct twaddle 
 This a fascinating book that argues quite convincingly the existence of a "dual soul" theory to explain the different claims about the afterlife.  It attempts to unite both those who believe (or through an NDE actually experienced) a Heaven/Hell afterlife with those who believe in reincarnation.  Novak argues that the human mind fragments at death, with the objective conscious mind going on to reincarnate, while the subjective unconscious mind with its memories, conscience and self-judgment experiences a Heaven or Hell scenario.  He offers compelling evidence from traditional religious texts and modern NDE accounts, wile putting them in the context of current scholarship on the right-left brain dichotomy.  I was with him for the entire intellectual journey, until the last few chapters, where he takes this fascinating theory and makes a leap too far based on his own personal religious convictions.  Novak argues that the only way for the human soul to achieve true peace and fulfillment is for the two halves of consciousness to be reunited after death.  That sounds perfectly reasonable.  And then Novak leaves behind his analytical hat and becomes an evangelist -- literally.  The final pages of the book become a rather tortured effort to convince the reader that this reunification of the soul can only happen through accepting Jesus Christ, whose death and resurrection reunited the binary souls for us.  All you have to do is believe in Jesus, and the spiritual work of reuniting your own inner dualities is no longer necessary.  As a Muslim and a Sufi mystic, I had to smile.  As Novak acknowledges, all of the world's spiritual traditions contain the idea that there are several layers of souls and dualities within the human condition, and that the goal of spiritual life is to reunite them.  I have learned this from Sufi teachings about the Ruh (spirit) and Nafs (ego) and and have found similiar ideas in Taoism, Jewish Kabbalah, Buddhism and other mystical paths.  The methods each of these traditions have developed rely on individual spiritual work and progress on the path.  Unfortunately for Novak, these tried and true methods that have helped human beings transcend duality are too "uncertain."  So he decides, based on nothing except his own personal conviction, that believing in Christ is a shortcut to healing the mind rift at death, removing the need to do the spiritual work that these "Old Path" traditions require.  For those of us who value human free will and the joy of the personal journey to God, the idea that we should just believe and let "Jesus do the big lifting" is not only erroneous, but it is dangerously self-deceptive.  This delusion of vicarious atonement removes individual responsibility for the spiritual journey, which is the central purpose of life.  Novak does such a wonderful job of explaining the ancient mystical truth that the human soul is bifurcated and must be reunited, it is a tragedy that he then tells his readers to skip the hard work of spiritual discipline because he believes someone else already did the work for everyone.  I feel as if Novak brought his readers to the verge of truth, only to hoodwink them at the last minute.  They see the destination, and then are told they don't need to walk to get there.  This delusion of vicarious atonement leads to a loss of personal moral responsibility and causes people to take the spiritual life for granted.  It is a cruel joke, and I am saddened that a man of such great intellect and passion can't see that his rejection of the very ancient wisdom he uses to buttress his theory dooms his efforts to help humanity at the end.  Novak helps people see that they need to overcome their inner duality and achieve unity, and then tells them they don't need to bother to actually do it, because its already been done for them by someone else.  If he is wrong, and my heart tells me he is deeply wrong, he has misled his readers and cursed them to spiritual stagnation.  His conclusion covers up what he has himself discovered about the purpose of the human condition -- to take one step at a time toward the Infinite, which is One and beyond duality.  Thank you Mr. Novak for showing how the Binary Soul Doctrine is an ancient belief in the human condition.  The Sufis, the Taoists and all other mystics new this already.  Now if you'll excuse us, those of us "Old Path" followers who believe in individual responsibility and choice will put our knowledge into action through spiritual practice, while the delusional wait for someone else to do the work for them 
 Sixty-nine pages into this book I have been astonished at the number of outrageous factual inaccuracies.  In describing the attack on Pearl Harbour at p.13 he describes each anchored battleship as "a small city with upward of 15,000 crew". According to "Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946" at pp. 91 & 92, their actual complement was between 1,050 and 2,375.A Nimitz class aircraft carrier has a crew of less than 6,000!  At p.15 the author goes on to assert that the battleship Arizona was hit by bomb "igniting more than one million tons of ammunition". A remarkable load for a ship which Conway's states had a displacement of 31,400 tons! And since the A-bomb dropped on Hiroshima was considered to be the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT, Professor Miller's explosion should have vaporized Oahu!  The absurdities continue into the Author's account of the Battle of Midway, where at p.43 he tells us that the Japanese carrier Soryu "was hit by 3,000 bombs". Since the three American carriers at Midway had a maximum total compliment of about 108 single-engine dive-bombers (plus about 48 torpedo carrying aircraft), the assertion is preposterous.  This book contains interesting first-hand accounts of combat by people who were involved, but one is soon left to wonder about the accuracy of any of the author's own statements about the events being described. 
 I bought this book initially expecting it to be a Marxist discussion of religion and its nature, considering it was published by Monthly Review Press and comes with a recommendation by Robert Brenner. But I must admit I was disappointed - not just because it wasn't that, but because what it does say is hardly very impressive.  Saxton starts his discussion of religion with a series of assumptions. The first is that humanity is in a great crisis the likes of which have been never seen, because of the threat of "nuclear/biological" destruction. The second is that religion in human development is old enough to be the product of biological evolution, and therefore must have had some sort of necessary purpose. These two ideas form the basis of the rest of Saxton's arguments.  Those proceed as following: religion is the form in which morality appears, and in ancient societies morality is what kept people from pursuing their self-interest at the expense of the tribe. Therefore, tribes with more religion had more chance to survive, and this made religion the more succesful 'meme', so to speak (Saxton doesn't actually use that word, but might as well have). For the many millennia following, religion kept serving the double purpose of keeping society together, which is a necessary thing, and of supporting "class and gender privilege", which is also a good thing, because without it we'd never have achieved the level of development we are now. However, because we are now in a situation where the threat is not from one society to another but from all of humanity against all of humanity, religion is no longer useful to serve this protective purpose, and on the contrary inhibits solving this problem, because religious people (with thoughts of the afterlife etc.) are less likely to create rational solutions for this issue.  The whole book is couched in the jargon of "cultural evolution", which makes for very superficial and annoying discussions of culture. Additionally, the chapter attempting to refute the Marxist view of religion is very poorly done and misses the point of the Marxist critique entirely - it is as if Saxton isn't aware of the existence of "On the Jewish Question", the best Marxist (and in my view altogether) discussion of religion there is. Some of Saxton's arguments regarding the possible origins of religion in prehistorical societies are persuasive, if somewhat short on proof, but for that he may be forgiven considering the little material we have to work with. But he ignores fundamental issues such as the possibility of morality without religion, the increasing relative amount of atheists in the world (he quite incorrectly assumes the opposite is true), and his dismissal of the negative role of religion as ideology by claiming that oppression is necessary to achieve development is completely ridiculous.   I'm frankly a bit surprised at Monthly Review and Brenner for apparently supporting this. It's not a terrible book but I can't see what it has to offer for a socialist when the traditional socialist critique of religion is so much better 
 I'm responsible for 10 computers at our organization. Last year we purchased Norton Antivirus 2006. It was such a resource hog that it stopped our older computers (550 Mhz) from working and I had to uninstall from all computers. After reading reviews that said 2007 was leaner, I tried to install this on 6 computers. Only 1 install went without problems. Installing on three other computers took 3 days, and I'm still not through with computer 5. Sometimes the program won't install. Once it crashes during install, it leaves behind broken code that prevents reinstall unless you use the Norton uninstall tool, which removes ALL Norton products. So in addition to uninstalling and reinstalling Antivirus, you also have to reinstall Norton Ghost or any other Norton products. On the computer I'm still fighting with the install went smoothly, but during the update the program hung up and now I can't open Norton Antivirus. Even worse, when I open a Word document, the Norton Antivirus starts scanning the document and freezes the computer.  What a nightmare 
 I have been reading several good guides to the Montessori method, including one volume from the library I was able to get written by Montessori herself.  I was hopeful that this book by Lillard would give good sound advice for practical current infant Montessori techniques based on a sound knowledge of Montessori.  Unfortunately this was not the case.    My biggest complaint regarding this book was the disregard shown to infant well being.  Leaving an infant alone for extended periods of time is not advisable and can be dangerous.  I had a very large objection to her advice that infants should be weaned at 9 months whether the infant seemed "ready" or not.  That certainly does not seem to be respecting an infant's innate intelligence.  Then there was the potty training at 12 months advice.  Well that may be great if your child is showing signs of readiness, it would not be advisable for the many many infants who are simply not developmentally ready at that stage.  Those ideas of the author are in direct conflict with Montessori principles of giving children materials for their developmental readiness.  Not all children will be ready then and forcing them as the author seems to suggest will not likely lead to positive results.    There are much better guides out there and this one I simply cannot recommend as it is harsh and gives an impression of Montessori principles that is not truly accurate in many instances.  
 It seems the authors of this book could not make up their minds if they were writing a reference book or a tutorial. This book fails as a tutorial by not spending enough time on basic subjects and is too disorganized to be an effective reference tool. There is a lot of information in there but good luck trying to find out how to do something specific 
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 This book has two key faults:  the author's unobjective/uncritical assessment of her subject and an asleep-at-the-wheel editor.  Carmel Snow seems to have been a fascinating and complex character, but the author's apparent idol/family-worship prevented her from viewing Mrs. Snow critically.  That ultimately makes the Mrs. Snow presented in this book a one-dimensional character - "Aunt Carmel who worked like a man, didn't have much time for her family, etc."  It would have been interesting to know, for example, why Bazaar's circulation numbers often didn't equal Vogue's, for all of the paeans to Mrs. Snow's editorial genius.  What were the real, business reasons for the housecleaning at Bazaar after Mr. Hearst died?  Mrs. Snow's alcoholism was almost entirely avoided until the very end, when it was presented as "Mrs. Snow liked to have several cocktails at lunch" and then noted only as the cause of a highly embarrassing social moment.  Alcoholism doesn't happen overnight, as it seems to in this book, and it would have been interested to know what effect it had on her work.  The book also suffers from the want of a good editor who could have eliminated the author's juvenile asides to the reader, e.g. "how to put it", "Pace, Nigella Lawson" etc.  
 I have to agree with the readers that have stated this is not as good as her earlier works.  She seems to be losing her passion and style.  This book is very disjointed in places and I don't care for the personal references she throws in from time to time.  The story will be moving along somewhat smoothly then she out of nowhere interjects a personal statement.  It really takes away from the narrative.    Also don't like the ficticious names nor the recycling of old stories.  Ms. Rule is a much better author than this book would ever show 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 This is an excellent textbook.....if you already have a PhD. in Fluid  Mechanics.  As a textbook for an undergraduate course though, it is useless  except possibly for using as a very large paper weight.  The text  completely lacks any useful examples.  Most are far too simplistic to be of  any use in solving the end of the chapter problems.  As far as the writing  style is concerned, the author fails to put items in a distinct clearly  stated way.  The text also lacks proper end of the chapter reviews of the  material, which should highlight the important concepts and equations for  quick reference.  The back of the text has solutions, but only to certain  problems and, as usual, in McGraw-Hill texts, only to the most basic and  simplistic questions.  In essence this text is a poor example to be used  for teaching the classs, unless of course the instructor makes the solution  manual available, in which case the student may have an outside chance of  understanding the course concepts.  I really I wish I had been like my  friends...they photocopied the necessary chapters for our course and saved  themselves about $80 
 This poor hodgepodge of a book should have been structured to explicate the immigration policies of each European country, then describe the experiences of each country with its Islamic radicals (and their families).  Instead, there is just a spouting forth of this and that information in a way that does not help readers see which immigration measures are useful and which are negative.  The poor linkage of measures to experience deprives readers of any handle on how the European countries can improve the situation in the future.  The author seems to feel that the United States has a much better handle on immigration than the European countries; he fails to note that the U.S. also has inconsistencies and problems in how it handles immigration.  This book is an example of a first draft that should have received far better treatment during the editorial process.  It should have been improved beyond simply an emotional screed into a book that enables readers to see what policies seem most effective in integrating immigrants into the body politic and which leave immigrants as separate, poor, and disillusioned groupings vulnerable to exploitation by organizations trying to undermine the European countries 
 What is this person trying to prove? Most of this book was created on a racist bent, not very professional if you ask me. Shouldn't we be enjoying their gifts to mankind, instead of crying about something so petty and childish? Egypt was a melting pot, GET OVER IT! Besides, the race of these wonderfull people shouldn't matter. Quit befouling a glorious culture with modern day "politics." 
 Thanks to Walker Percy a manuscript about a rotund medievalist with a pronounced aversion to gainful employment was saved from the dustbin.  Unfortunately, Percy's own works, variations on Russian humbuggery doused in southern discomfort, often slip into an existential coma. The Last Gentleman barely has a pulse. After an engaging opening with a baby who emerges from a hurricane, the novel gets downright tiresome. When examining the limits and conundrums of human freedom, Percy lacks the subtlety of the far superior storyteller Robert Penn Warren. In this instance, Percy's women are insufferably tedious, his men only slightly more amusing. Mr. Vaught induces a grin in seersucker, but the protagonist, a nearly transparent figure known as the engineer, has the charm and presence of an expired june bug. He talks nonsense with a jumbled up girl and, in a fugue state, wanders around for days not knowing his name. After a while, the weary reader prays he'll wander across a busy freeway 
 It just goes on and on about things I don't care abou 
 I found that the book has quite a bit of typos, mispellings, and at times contradictory information. This was espeically frustrating and confusing, since preparing for a test that draws on such a wide pool of information is trying enough. I used Barron's which I thought was alright, but I have to attribute my passing the CLEP to the CLEP Comprehensive Success System, [...]. The problems on the CLEP were very similar to the problems in the three practice tests in the end of this other study guide I bought.  If you want to waste your hard earned money and precious time on a poorly written study guide, this CLEP Official Study Guide 18th Edition is the book for you. Some of the grammatical errors in this book are so outrageous, and overall, the book is just a jumbled compilation of historical facts, with no specific "plan of attack" to help you pass the CLEP.   
 I suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something. But......dear GOD that thing is ugly 
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 I must write quickly, for soon, soon, the Milk will awake within me again.  And it will know, but you will have been warned.  The Milk will punish me, but it knows it must have a host, so I will survive - tormented and trapped within myself, but I will continue to exist, though I live in nightmare now.  Beware!  Beware the Milk!  For the Milk lives.  I too was once tempted by the smooth, sweet creaminess of Tuscan Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 Fl Oz.  I too read the odes written to its greatness, not knowing that the Milk was forcing it's hosts to speak of the goodness of the Milk that the Milk might spread, that it might acquire new hosts in which to live, and to spread, to spread, to spread.  Beware the sweet seduction of the Milk!  Ah - the bittersweet memories of that first gallon.  How smooth, how creamy, how exhilarating, uplifting, fulfilling and enlightening!  How free it made me feel!  But then came that terrible moment when in my home town supermarket, I reached for a gallon of store brand milk, and felt the pain.  Oh, the pain the Milk can give!  Equal in intensity to the first joy that the Milk can give, but pain!  Terrible pain!  Words alone cannot describe it!  And now, I live in fear of the Milk, a Slave to the joy and the pain it can give.  Oh, the shame I feel that I must come to the Milk like a supplicant, begging for the pleasure it can give.  And the cowardice that I feel, knowing that I cannot face the pain it can inflict.  Beware!  Do not let this be your fate!  And now, I must go... the Milk stirs inside me, and it will be angry.  But perhaps, perhaps, it is not too late for you... 
 Not a bad printer; I like the quality of print... but as said elsewhere, very expensive to maintain... Ink cartridges don't last long and are, as far as I can tell, more expensive 
 I was honestly dissapointed with this album. I bought this album with the expectation of the caliber of songs that was found on the album RAIN.This album is average. All I can do is sigh and hope the next album is better 
 I've taken kickboxng classes and have owned other kickboxing DVDs but did not like this one. Its boring, Kathy seems to be doing a number of the moves in an awkward manner and the other people on set are distracting -- from their outfits to their sloppy moves. Skip this one 
 This book was not up to my expectations. Maybe I understood this introduction wrong- I hoped to find some hints to find great employees and some new ideas. Instead I read many times, that it is important to hire great employees and that they are not easy to find. To my opininon it is more like a childrens book, than for the adults. I am not a manager, but I read nothing new, instead I understood, that we are doing things ok already in our company. In real world things are not so easy and simple as in this book. At least not in Estonia, people are bit smarter. Some of the titles in this book were  longer that the chapters itself, I was lucky to get one good sentence per chapter 
 I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated.   My advice: avoid SUNPAK like the Plague!   
 This album is not terrible, it is quite adequate and even sophisticated in a background music sort of way..It is just not very engaging on the forefront though..We all know Alex is a masterful programmer, but the famework that surrounds his beats this time generally does not hold the listeners attention, the album is mostly a showcase for the spastic and weird, rather then evolving beats that engulf a listener into the most immersive experience techno has to offer..You could definitly track this artist's waxing and waning of artistic zeal, with this album continuing Patterson's return to his more dancy, breezy roots, while incorporating the more twisted, dark elements of his post ultraworld releases. 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Im begging that whoever tryed to cap Fiddy Cent try it again. This time, however, with a much bigger gun.  As for the music, this gives talented rappers (I use that loosely, rap is garbage, always been, always will) a bad name. Do your ears a favor, take a blowtorch to this 
 If this is a re-issue of their 1994 debut album "Life", then can someone tell me why "Carnival" wasn't included?  I love the Cardigans, but for some strange reason their biggest hit in Europe was not included in this CD.  For that reason alone, I defintely do not recommned this album and I urge people instead to purchase "Life".  I give it 1 star because it is utterly perplexing why "Carnival" wasn't included.  
 The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims "4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly "cards for all occasions" means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own 
 Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, "could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?"  Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.  A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature 
 There are precious few books available which deal with the writing and production of shorts, which is odd considering the grown explosion the form has gone through the last few years, so I almost hate to be critical of what information is available.  That said, this 1994 guide is in desperate need of updating, as it does not deal with short films in the digital medium.  Now that digital video has made it even easier to produce a short--not to mention that it's opened up the possibilities of what can be accomplished on film on a budget--the process of making a short needs to be addressed in the current context.  In addition, with the number of internet sites specializing in shorts, and the practice of most film festivals of accepting digital submissions, the possibilities of making and distributing a short have far outgrown what this book covers.  Please, Mr. Levy--give us a new edition of this fine guide 
 If you're considering buying this book...save your money.  This book is the same as the online study guide on the Border Patrol's website.  It has the same questions and the same alternative language.  It does have a couple full-length practice tests.  I was hoping for some insight into the actual test or some "inside" information that may not be outlined on the Border Patrol's website or in its' study guide.  I was VERY disappointed with this purchase 
 I was surprised how shockingly dull this book was compared to his "Gates of Fire."  This is a book desperately searching for a plot.  One can get a better picture of Alcibiades reading a "traditional" history (Donald Kagan's "The Peloponnesian War" is highly recommended).  Read "Gates of Fire" or "The Last Amazon" instead.  You will be disappointed if you buy this book 
 This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide 
 I really liked Dick's "Do Androids Dream" and was excited to read another of his books.  What a disappointment!  The characters in "The Divine Invasion" seem to exist only for symbolic reasons.  Dick needs a protagonist to convey his religious theory but he doesn't create anyone believable.  The main character, Herb Asher, is obsessed with a sappy singer named Linda Fox or "The Fox" (how eighties is that?) but we don't find out what he likes so much about her.  His wife, a virgin who carries Yaweh (God) as a human child, comes across as unlikeable and morbid.  As a musician, I feel that Dick's portrayal of the music industry and the sound system that Asher sells to The Fox is absurd.  For such a visionary as Dick it seems pretty silly to write about music tapes in a future of space colonization... I mean did he think we'd be recording to tape forever??  Also there are a couple of chapters in which Dick writes about powerful religious leaders who seem to be forgotten by the end of the book.  I will say that I think PKD's religious ideas are interesting.  I like his portrayal of God and the Torah as being parts of the same whole.  It's also interesting that he explains that the angry god of the Jewish Bible is only one facet of God's personality.  This is something that bothers me about the bible and I'm glad to see Dick addressing it.  Aside from these things, I wouldn't recommend "The Divine Invasion" 
 Through out all other korn albums I hate is mostly this album this is the worst album of korn. And the worst songs that were overrated are ALL IN THE FAMILY with guest fred durst doing a rap battle against jonathan which was so stupid and pathetic and CHILDREN OF THE KORN with ice cube rapping a duet with jonathan davis who sings in soft growling whining anger which was stupid and annoying and PRETTY. These were the worst songs and the rest of the songs were just awful and jonathan is a horrible untalented singer and for the band horrible guitar riffs. They need alot of work on it 
 If you like the Beatles you might not like what has been done to their music on this album. I liken it to one of those K-tel brand album collections where you get hit songs sung by someone other than the original recording artist. Yes this is the Beatles but they are "one off" - you'll know what I mean when I hear the album.   I know that is the point but it could have been so much better rather than the "Disneyfied" approach they took. I believe that others have done more with the music (with less cooperation from EMI). Ultimately a CD that is doomed to collect dust.    
 I have the book, but you can do a search right now and attempt to find the word NUCLEAR in this older release. Dr. James Lovelock was right (see his REVENGE OF GAIA). Well-meaning researchers have a built-in and historic bias against nuclear energy as a policy/techology option to quell carbon emissions. And that bias has to be exposed for what it is: ignorance and/or inadequate risk assessment.  Can one of the authors of this book please give Amazon book reviewers a reasonable explanation for this? Especially for a book published only a few years ago? Did Island Press refuse to have a nuclear policy analyst included in the mix 
 I am a graduate student in organizational development.  Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging.  It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations.  There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters 
 "the close-minded, vain beliefs that most Christians harbor. anti-intellectual" I hear this all the time from close minded pushing only one theory.   Who is the one with a closed mind? sounds obvious to me. Give us students the freedom of choice, I don't want one idea forced on me. be it evolution or intelligent design, the danger is having only one idea. What the Catholic church did at one time abused and perverting christianity for its own powers and control, this is now being done by evolution and those closed minded thinking by forcing one theory. there are only 2 options, the earth created itself, or someone created it. give me my freedom of choice. Thank you 
 I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad.  I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie.  The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular.  It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art.  That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real. 
 First of all, this book mentions "the heart" and strays from the truth of scripture terribly. God's word says the "heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it?" There is nothing good in our hearts, apart from Christ, and whatever "good" there might be in there comes from Him. Scripture tells us that in the last days the church will go into apostasy. This time has come like no other time before. There is a move to to throw out scripture and move past it, ignoring what God has already told us. What we need to know is in scripture--especially those things we need to know about Him and what He requires of us. This move in the church today to "feel" God and go "to a deeper level" is a reawakening of mysticism which does not belong in the body of Christ. The truth and objectives of scripture are not mystical, for a reason. Jesus Christ was and is not a mystic. This movement is called "contemplative spirituality" and it is subtle and dangerous. Sadly, even Eldredge has taken this route. How many more good authors and great men of God are going to forsake the completeness of God's word to turn inward to "self" and think they will find something new? Solomon said, "there is nothing new under the sun." The devil wants us to think we can reinvent and invent "new" outside of God's marvelous confines. We need to stick to scripture and stop reading books like these written by men who want to offer us something more than the Lord commanded us. We are treading on shaky ground, but all we need is His glorious word and to do what He said: "Keep my commandments. 
 I felt the movie lacked. The end was a real let down. I have seen better 
 These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid. 
 The central problem in this novel is that a main character can only be too desperate before one begins to despise them.  
 Compiling two specials made for TNT, and Chuck Jones' 1941 "Horton Hatches The Egg" (From his early Disney-like peroid) to boot, it's nothing more than a thrownaway! Get the DVD of "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Horton Hears A Who" instead 
 Frequently demonstrably wrong, and regularly claims "facts" that do not seem to occur in any other source, casting serious doubt upon their authenticity. Anyone repeating anything from this book runs a severe risk of perpetuating inaccuracies. For example, the claim in the blurb that "Twenty people literally "drowned in beer" in 1814 when a vat in a London brewery exploded" is simply not true - only eight people died, all when  buildings collapsed, and the vat never "exploded", one of the hoops broke and it collapsed 
 A good book to get through the basics, or for incredibly light reading. Most of this proved to be skimming material, as it touched on things I already know and think upon myself. If you're looking for something with depth and meat, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 Updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development.  As other have stated, you know from page one that the final page will involve an Arab, a truck and a bomb.  The lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing, interesting character development or original insights.  Updike fails to deliver on all three counts.  One particularly slipshod literary technique Updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character Ahmad.  When Ahmad speaks, it is in the voice of an intelligent, thoughtful foreigner.  His phrasing captures very well the cadence, vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of English.  Curiously, Ahmad IS an American, raised in New Jersey by a thoroughly American mother.  So, what influences created this stilted phrasing?  Updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a Jersey teenager speaks like a Pakistani or Egyptian immigrant.  There is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is grating.  Updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious stereotypes.  Sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature.  However, in Updike's case, the stereotypes make little sense at all.  For instance, a high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his "Jewishness" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality.  This is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a Jew and, in fact, his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier.  So where does all the Jewsih influence come from?  Likewise, Ahmad's mother's personality is often linked to her Irish heritage.  Yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her Irish background (which could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit.  The reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development.  Another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the Korna in Arabic.  Obviously, few Western readers will understand Arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for Updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages.  What comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research.  If that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in Western script rather than Arabic script.  After all, the Koran is not written with Western phonetics in mind. Ultimately, the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight, poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author 
 At first I was happy to be able to purchase a printer for such a low price.  However, the price should be even lower for this pile of junk.  Every time I attempt to print, I spend several minutes trying to feed it paper.  The printer will intake several pieces of paper at the same time instead of just one, and it will jam up.  Even if I just feed it one piece of paper at a time, it will often still jam on just one piece of paper.  Printing should not be this hard.  These problems have occurred since I first purchased the printer.  I regret purchasing this printer, as I should have went with a higher end model.  I've lost respect for HP products because of the poor quality of this printer 
 If your looking for something beyond gradeschool math (read:algebra/geometry)then I wouldn't recommend this book. The formulas would be usefull in modifying from an already set or measured value (tire size,mph,mpg) but would not be usefull when trying to design, analyze or mathmaticaly model anything. Use of English units nice for laymen.  I was dissapointed at the lack of truely usefull equations, most seem to be shuffling of equations.  Conversion tables are nice however 
 To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander.  The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited.  Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.  It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".  [... 
 Sure he knows his stuff but doesn't have a clue on how to write. This is appallingly poorly written. It is one of the most ridiculously disorganized collections of academic 'verbage' (verbiage subsumes garbage) I have ever read. It's almost useless as a reference: its very non-linear (say non-deterministic almost) in concept elucidation (perhaps he's taken the notion of multithreading too much to heart and tried multi-threaded writing???). It's useless as a book to learn from- since learning by example is not just a way to learn, but the only way to learn (Einstein) and this book largely disavows examples.  What it needs is another edition with a ghost writer. Seriously it's not good. Try Paul Hyde for a good intro to threads.   While those at guru-ish level may love this book, those of us for whom threads represent a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves, would probably want to throw this book in frustration of the author's inability to structure a coherent sentence with a clear point. This meanders on like great uncle herb's war stories and is equally will sapping.  Avoid if you can or check it out when you reach guru-ness. It's a good cure for insomnia though 
 Reading this book I expected to feel the flavor of ancient Egypt and was very disappointed. As much as Haney loves Egypt she fails to convey this in her book.  The Elizabeth Peters books, written in a completely different time period at least portray some ideas of ancient Egypt.  Haney's characters seem shallow and the dialogue sounds more like modern American than Egyptian.  I had a difficult time "enjoying" the story line as I had to continually fight with the dialogue and lifestyle descriptions 
 I really enjoyed Jean-Claude's earlier films.  But, they keep seeming to get worse and worse.  The dude kicked like 3 times in the film.  The best part of Jean-Claude's films are the fight scenes and these sucked.  You know you are getting cheese whenever you watch any of his movies but instead of cheedar this was some moldy government crap!  I'm really hoping he'll get with Steven Segal talk about how much they both suck, watch their old movies and then go back to thier roots 
 it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a "masterpiece" and "touching". Well this left me cold. How many times does this novel need to be written? there are many ways to create unforgettable characters and working the hell out of tired stereotypes is not one of them.  Also, read something by Julius Lester if you want to see this kind of thing done well 
 I really should ask for my money back on this book....it was poorly written, vague in description, the cover is great and appears appealing....this is not worth the price of admission. Sorry.! 
 The men literally drag the women by their hair in this novel, it is beyond me how it got categorized as a romance.  The romance is virtually non-existant whereas violence is abundant.  If you're looking for brutality, rape, incest, homosexuality, and things of that nature, read this novel.   
 I've bought a used car, and while the ashtray was clean and new, and there was no smell at the moment of purchase, this was just due to the pre-sale preparation (deodorizing procedure). In a couple of weeks I started feeling the disgusting residual cigarette (or may be cigar) smell...   I tried EVERYTHING, including Febreeze, and even a special "smoke grenade" that they put inside the car and start the A/C in order to circulate deodorizing gas through the whole system. Nothing worked. I didn't believe in this thing from the start, but was desperate, and tried...  Guess what: after 3 weeks of persistent presence inside the car (all instructions were followed) NOTHING changed. So do not throw your hard-earned 35 bucks away!  Leo, P 
 I am a big fan of the show, and was disappointed that for so long, only a few episodes were available to purchase, and those were only on VHS. I was really happy when I heard they're releasing the complete series on DVD... but if you ask me, these DVDs are worse than having nothing at all.  The box advertises "complete, uncut" episodes and yet many episodes are missing scenes for no apparent reason. I can't imagine the reason for this. The DVD picture and sound quality are far worse than the VHS releases. How does that even happen? The episodes are also missing the introductions (which are different for each episode, depending on guest stars, etc)... left out for no reason. The DVDs also have no chapter stops whatsoever.  How does this happen in the modern day entertainment industry? No one in charge of product quality, no one even attempting to release something up to DVD standards, yet they hired someone to delete scenes that aren't crucial to the plot? I just don't get it... did they think DVDs have very limited space, and they have to take any steps necessary to reduce the length of the show?  The Little House series still appears on cable TV. You can literally get a much better quality product simply by taping the shows off of TV... this DVD release is a joke.  It's a bit frustrating to see so many shows (including older shows and less popular ones) are having great DVD releases, with great quality video and sound, and actor commentary despite the show being made decades ago... and then to see that Little House is treated so poorly 
 I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents 
 	Sally Denton's Faith and Betrayal is a disappointing book. It promised all the elements of an exceptionally dramatic (and true) story: love and loss, wealth and poverty, dedication and disillusionment, an epic journey, a peculiar religion, polygamy, theocracy, a massacre, and perhaps betrayal. But Denton's account is so replete with inaccuracies and confusion of facts that it destroys all credibility. Listing her errors would take nearly as many pages as the book itself. In addition she failed to use the richest repository of primary sources of Mormon history-the LDS Church Historical Department Archives. Presumably this is because she assumed she would not be welcome, she believed the records there had been selectively censored, or she thought they would have little relevance.  	As a non-Mormon historian working on the stories of disillusioned converts in the same period of the mid-nineteenth century, I can assure her that for the past decade I have never been refused generous help in the Church Archives and have found the records there amazingly rich, especially the correspondence of Brigham Young and the diaries of contemporaries of those who left the church.  	Denton makes Jean Rio's piano a pivotal issue, which she says was brought to Utah in 1851, though Jean Rio never mentions it in her trip diary nor does the captain of the company she traveled with in his (which is in the Church Archives). Denton fails to give a source for her account of it. It is quite possible Jean Rio ordered the piano later after her arrival in Salt Lake and had it shipped from the East. As for the tar-covered crate (p. 165), if that is in a museum in California, could not have Denton done the research to find where it is?  	Was Jean Rio's piano taken by the church leaders through "consecration"-a rule of stewardship (pp. xvii, 129)? Did Denton bother to inquire in the Church Archives what the consecration records show? Not all records survived, but many did. It is unlikely the church purged them of information about the piano. Likewise, did Denton ever ask the staff at the Museum of Church History and Art about the provenance of the piano? One Jean Rio descendent believes it was gifted to the museum by a Mormon descendant. Here again Denton confuses her facts: She states (p. 130) that the piano is in the "Church Temple Museum"; there is no such institution.  	Denton claims the piano ended up in the "Amelia Palace, the home of Young's favorite wife, a beautiful Englishwoman named Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning..." (p. 129). Here Denton has all too typically confused Young's so-called "favorite" wife Harriet Amelia Folsom with a later wife, Ann Eliza. Neither were English. The Gardo House, the so-called "Amelia's Palace," was not finished until after Brigham Young's death; Amelia lived in it a short period to establish her claim in Young's will, while Ann Eliza never lived there.  	Denton quotes from one of my papers (pp. 153-54), and although the quote is correct, she misinterprets my account, stating "The flow of Mormon defectors had become the largest emigration to that point, far surpassing even the California gold rush." No records can support that idea. Likewise, she claims that "U.S. Army escorts oversaw a burgeoning traffic of disaffected Mormons fleeing Zion." There was only one such escort from Salt Lake of approximately forty families.  	Although a beautifully produced little book, publisher Alfred A. Knopf should be embarrassed at having accepted and published such a consistently unreliable "history." I'm sorry to advise potential readers not to waste their money 
 i ordered this, based largely on the concept, which seemed like a book on gay history that was much needed to fill in the gaps. instead, the book comes off as if Kaiser got a nice advance and then needed to submit *some* kind of manuscript, but he had lots of other things to do, so he did the absolute minimal amount of new research. instead, he relies heavily on taped interviews with 6 or 7 gay men to fill out the pages. The chapter on the '70s, one of the most important decades in gay history, has nothing more than former bartenders saying that "the Mineshaft was wild, man" and a politico friend of his talking about how he semi-came out of the closet. No sense of the "gay metropolis" here, just a random series of unconnected anecdotes. I hope he got a nice advance, but this book isn't really worth actually BUYING - just check it out at the library, in all its dismalness, and see for yourself. 
 I am not going to go over the plot or what I liked about the novel because the other reviewers did a good job explaining that.   What I don't like about the novel is the author's rudimentary writing style. His character (or environment) descriptions are nonexistent; instead, he let's the conversations do the job of describing the characters but this gives the novel a very dry feeling, a lack of mood or atmosphere.   Another thing that I don't like about his style is that at times the author branches off of the main line and goes to unnecessary details which add nothing to the "whole" and feel like leftover parts that don't fit in with the "whole".  Yet another one (which is common to the author's other novels as well) is the characters' weird conversations and weird lines of reasoning. In this novel this is not too obvious because most of the weirdness is attributed to the fact that the characters are heavy drug users, but there are still some parts which irritates the reader, for instance where the woman locks her boyfriend out of the apartment because he is trying to kill her but when he goes to the parking lot and starts slashing her car's tires, she runs out to protect her tires at the risk of her life. Or the elderly couple criticizing the neighborhood for such frequent fights when they comment that the worst part about the neighborhood is that "there is dog do everywhere"! One would think that among murderous, drug addict, drug dealer neighbors it should be relatively unimportant whether the streets are clean or not! This scene is an example for the type of weirdness I was referring to and actually it is a good example to my previous criticism about "brancing-off" unnecessarily: if this scene was omitted, it would have taken nothing away from the "whole".  Over 100 reviewers here at Amozon gave this novel 5 stars. Perhaps I am missing something but just because other people liked it, I can't say that I like it. For me, negativities outweigh the positive aspects and hence two stars. I think it is overrated, and if the author wasn't Dick but an unknown first timer, it would have got a lot worse reviews.  
 This book covers writing for the genres of Mystery, Suspense, and Thriller.  Mystery:  I'd recommend this section to anyone writing a mystery.  The mystery section is excellent and well done.  It gives great examples, describes the genre elements necessary to a mystery, goes through various subgenres, and gives examples.  Suspense/Thriller:  Then I get to this section.  Suspense and thriller are done together, with the focus on suspense.  Where I got excellent examples of mysteries, for Thriller, I got "once upon a time" fairy tale stuff.  Little was discussed about core elements of a thriller, no real examples given, and only a few subgenres were even mentioned--one of which, even at the time of this book's publication--is no longer selling well (techno).  The section made me wonder if the author actually read any Thrillers.  So for Mystery writers, it gets 3 stars; for Thrillers, I wouldn't recommend it 
 Oochie Wally was tight so I got it. It was one my favorite songs at that time.  The album made me keep hitting the skip button.  And then one of them said that he will sell crack to a pregnant women on Straight outta Queensbridge.  So what!!You proud of that? I decided to look past that and listen to rest of it.  I'm cool with cuss words but when they are overused it takes alway from the music.  The cd was boring from start to finish.  It seemed like they was trying to be NWA or something on Straight outta Queensbridge.  They should be more original.  This is not 1990.  And then I almost fell out when Our Way came on. It opened with them saying "Drive Drunk To This" ova and ova again.  Hey I wonder if I drive drunk to this and killed some of your family members will you still say that.  That was totally ignorant. For Real. Think about what you saying.  Have compassion for the people killed by drunk drivers.  That alone warrants the 1 star but the cd still sucked.  I thought Nas was betta then that.  I feel like cussing somebody out after hearing this.LO 
 This book came highly recommended to me, and I have to admit, nothing about it was significant or spectacular.  My two immediate conclusions for why this book recieves such rave reviews are fan nostalgia, and that the creators who immediately proceeded Byrne really botched things up.  I tend to dislike a book more than I otherwise would when a book fails to live up to high expectations.  Unfortunately, this is the case here.  Not to say that this is a bad read.  It isn't.  Byrne is at the top of his game here, and it shows on every page.  But modern comics have inevitably eclipsed this material (compare the Fantastic Four vs. Ego to the modernized version of The Authority vs. "God").  Sometimes it's not the novelty of a story that makes it great, but the way it's told.  I'll say this:  buy this book if, and only if, you are a Fantastic Four completist.  Otherwise, you're gonna be walking in on someone else's show.  
 This book tries to explain how and why the media would try to send out its ideals to the masses through a selective exposé of certain television programs such as THE SIMPSONS, BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, REN & STIMPY SHOW, MURPHY BROWN, LA LAW, COPS; political and celebrity personalities like the BUSH's, BILL CLINTON, WILLIAM BORROUGHS, PHIL DONAHUE, RUSH LIMBOUGH, PEEWEE HERMAN (Paul Reubens), THE JACKSONS, MADONNA, ICE T, and even quite peculiar for me even the whole controversy with one of my personal faves U2 over the legal frictions with a parody band called NEGATIVLAND (which is rather more documented on the documentary feature flick of the said group) and even more so about the band that I often refer to -  JESUS JONES regarding their music video for their perrenial track "Right Here Right Now" and the advent of MTV's outbreak with the likes of music videos from A-HA; BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN; and even more so mentioning the likes of `wanna-whats' like R.U. SERIOUS, and the cult of Genesis P-Orrige called THEE TEMPLE OV PSYCHIC YOUTH - the book nearly gives an impression that the author is culture-shocked, and proposed to infect likewise with the `memes' (ie. A term used by the author to refer about the certain data/info's that are being assimilated n=by the media which in turn affects to influence the masses, at least in the way I understood it and could simply put it) it presents to expose - however, the whole matter is subject to the particular perspective preference of the readers personal comprehension.  The book is said to have been "revised and updated" from a two-year's span by 1996 - even seems quite un-innovative even from that time, and most of the authors' analysis are nothing new. Rushkoff, although being quite informative nevertheless from time to time with the book only seem to mainly dwell on a surface level, when what we need is to see more of the primal motivating factors behind the dissemination of counter-culture trends and ideas which Rushkoff attempted to disseminate within the length of his work. 
 Typically, Tess Gerritsen (TG) has shown herself a decent writer ... nothing stellar but always competent and better than many of her peers.  However, she now apparently has an agenda to fulfill.  Whether it's self-imposed or her editor mandated it, TG has attempted to write a romance thriller.  And, unfortunately, in her crusade to complete this book she felt that she must constantly figuratively shove the following themes down the readers' collective throats.  - Women are strong and can serve in the same position as men - Women have the added burden of child-bearing - Catholic school upbringing is very tough, especially for women - Other than a few studs sprinkled throughout the book, most of the men are criminals or ultimately heartless.  Oh yeah, there was one fat ex-cop who had a crush on Jane Rizzoli.  OKAY, Mrs. Gerritsen, we get it.  Most men are jerks!  Much of my problem with the book lies with the fact that I never was able to buy into several of TG's proposed premises.  The remotely potential love interest in the priest.  The ex-husband stud/suspect.  The crime itself, I could see why the coverup but I never understood --- did Octagon pay Dr. Sutcliffe to kill the people and, if indeed he was the sole killer, why would Sutcliffe, a doctor mind you, murder the victims using such gruesome methods?  And most embarassingly for my self, since I'd rather lost interest by this point, did Sutcliffe even do all of the killings?  It never made sense to me and seemed very slapped-together.  For the few readers who don't already know this, TG used to write romance thrillers.  This novel was more like a throwback to that genre.  I picked The Sinner up thinking it would be a concise, riveting thriller, instead, through mind-numbingly average writing, I was reminded for 342 pages how unreliable and underhanded my gender (male) always acts.  Sorry, TG, that's another premise I'm just not able to subscribe to 
 This CD is awesome from beginning to end.  I really enjoy listening to this type of music.  This CD is a must have.  
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 Poor video quality, extra thrill section lame, it like one big advertisement rather then detailed clips of passes and crashes. I have 2004 dvd which is much better. Don't buy 2006 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 In Infernal, Repairman Jack's latest of ten novels, his adopted family is put in mortal danger by the last surviving member of his bloodline, his older brother Tom and Jack doesn't like it one bit..  For those of you who have never had the pleasure of reading a Repairman Jack story; let me edify you. To fans of Repairman Jack, he is without a doubt the most beloved of the contemporary fictional figures, bar none. He has a fan club, Stephen King is a charter member, after his first book and a couple short stories, he disappeared for ten years and was bought back by popular demand.   Who is this guy?   Jack could be described as a fixer - you got problem and for a fee, he can fix it, or a champion of the oppressed - you can't afford a fee, we'll work something out. To the government he doesn't exist. He has never collected a paycheck and has never paid income tax. He has no credit, no credit cards, no FICO score, has never voted, has no social security card, has never been arrested, has no driver's license or passport (at least in his real name). In short, he works outside the system totally under the radar.   Jack has a fianc named Gia, who has a nine year old daughter named Vickey. She doesn't approve of what Jack does but Jack has saved both their lives on more than one occasion, so she grudgingly accepts his occupation. Jack is crazy about both of them and Vickey idolizes Jack.   More about Jack   Jack is average in every way - average height, weight, looks, hair and eyes and clothes. Since Jacks works within an underground society he works at blending in, being non descript if you will but that's where all similarities to an average man end.   Jack is tough as nails. When he doesn't have a client he works out and practices martial arts. Jack is deadly in a fight and is afraid of no one. Has Jack beat anyone up? You bet. Has he killed anyone? Only those who deserved it and even then, reluctantly. Jack has friends in low places like the intractable, Abe, proprietor of a sporting goods store that is a front for an armory, both legal and illegal weapons. The more you read him the more you decide that Jack is a very interesting fellow.   The Plot  Jack receives the shock of his life when his father is killed in a terrorist massacre at the airport. In all, the terrorists killed over fifty, in the baggage claim section, mostly Hasidic Jews, but bystanders such as Jack's Father on Joey Castle's brother. Jack encountered Joey and his brother, occasionally in the course of business. Joey Castle and his brother were grifters, scam artists, who bilked people for a living. Jack didn't approve of what they did but discounting their marks, who were always looking for something for nothing, thought they were stand up guys.  Jack's last remaining relative was his older brother Tom, with whom Jack never got along. Unfortunately, since Jack was a non-entity, he needed his brother to claim their father's body. Tom, who was a judge from Philadelphia, was curious about his younger brother, since his father had told him that if he were ever in trouble, you could count on Jack to cover his back and Tom was in big trouble.  Tom, after an undistinguished career as a Judge, presiding in a culture of graft and bribery, was about to be indicted. Tom with Gia's help, convinced Jack to go to on a trip to Bermuda, ostensibly to close out an off shore account he had there. However, the ultimate reason was to have Jack's help to find treasure in an unknown sunken ship that Tom had a map for. The ship was there alright but what they found was the antithesis of treasure, placing Jack's whole family in danger.   Conclusion  Some of you who have read my book reviews know that I consider F. Paul Wilson, to be one of my favorite authors. I still do, but the latest Repairman Jack book by Wilson, Infernal, in my opinion, is not a very good book. I don't mean it's awful. More like very disappointing. It still is good enough to hold your interest and finish in a timely manner. But this is a Repairman Jack novel and it doesn't stand the comparison test.  What can I say? The book just didn't grab me. I thought the plot was weak and holey (I don't mean religious), the characters were unlikable and the writing just so-so. I never thought I'd say that about an F. Paul Wilson book. I even found a couple typos that the editor missed, normally no big deal but in this case, it adds to the appearance of what I consider a carelessly written, probably rushed book.   Report Card Plot                D- Story               D Writing style       C+ Characters          C- Readability         C  Would I recommend this book? Only if you were a RJ fanatic. Otherwise no! Final rating 2.5 strars 
 Enough reviewers have groused that the verdict is in -- The Owl and the Pussycat WAS a classic that rocked, until the idiot Babs and the Columbia scissor boys got hold of it.  If I were Buck Henry, I'd be angry.  The majority of people who would be interested in this film ALREADY SAW IT in our relative youth.  That means we saw Babs nude and we heard the "F" word that had everyone talking, as she tells off a bunch of moochers.  More than a few of us need to give Columbia a piece of our minds.  This is unconscionable.  The nude scene was NOT destroyed, it was BLOCKED from the collar bone down (she was laying in Barney's bed, asking "Whatdaya think?" just before Felix joined her.  It still exists in the vault.  I own a copy with the "F" word intact, and in context, it only makes it funny.  COLUMBIA, NOW HEAR THIS: GIVE US THIS FILM IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, OR GIVE US NOTHING! 
 I'll make this short and sweet for you.  I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this "gem" and see what all the fuss is about on this game.  OVERRATED.  I have no idea how people prais this as "THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!"...How silly, This game is just plain average..  If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve..I don't need to tell you but I'll give you a hint....H***f L*fe...This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring...And I don't need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours..  The good Visuals are good I guess  Bad Very Mediocer Plain boring combat...Nothing new Online isn't that great Extreamly Overrated...TRUST ME.. Gets boring after awhile And yes I played this out for more then an 1hour...2 bucks I'll never get back  2.1 out of 5 stars....  Extreamly Overrated, Not worth my 2 bucks, and that's all I got to say....  Peac 
 I seriously did not laugh once in this movie.  Horatio Sanz got me to crack a smile a couple times, but I can't believe I think he should have been in the movie more.  I thought Saturday Night Live was bad, I had no idea!  SNL is gold compared to this.  Every single joke falls flat and the director obviously has no clue how to make a movie.  I can't even tell if Jerry O'Connel and Jake Busey are bad actors because the director doesn't even give them a chance.  I think one thing that could have really helped this movie out would have been a script.  In case the director reads this review I want to tell him you need to have a script BEFORE shooting a film.  Just a tip.    One of the worst movies I have ever seen, easily.      0/ 
 We just got back from 5 days in New Orleans, and this was the only guide we took with us. It was a mistake. It's a difficult book to navigate, has limited maps, limited selection of accomodation & restaurants. If you go outside of Madi Gras & with children (two teenagers in our case) half the book is irrelevent. The restaurant '100 best' list doesn't match Zagats (always reliable). It warns against solo visits to the cemeteries (they're not safe, go on a tour), but doesn't explain why! Pity there isn't a Michelin Green Guide 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 I travel extensively and am a fan of Frommer's guides which I generally find to have a nice assortment of options in varying price ranges.  The volume on South Africa however, was a great disappointment.  If Frommer's were to be believed, you had to pay $200 and up for a decent hotel room.  Fortunately I have often traveled in South Africa, enjoyed its reasonably priced accomodations, and knew such prices were nonsense.  I stayed in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and other top destinations in season for less than half that much.  The guide also overlooked  destinations a bit off the beaten path and proved of so little use to me that I didn't bother to pack it home with me. I strongly suggest the Eyewitness guide instead or just surf the web for tons of great information from the South African Tourism Board.  
 He wrote a long essay about it, and condemned it for being an "unmoral" (as opposed to "immoral") book.  If he used the adjective "brilliant," it was probably in a negative way.  Believe me, he was no fan of the author or of this particular book 
 Really a Master Piece Can take to the Moon and another planets also. Iqbal Lodhi 
 I'm wondering if the previous reviewers did any online research on the subject before purchasing the book & giving it rave reviews. There's very little information in the book that I can't easily find online. A good/reputable essential oil supplier's website would contain much more information than this book. The descriptions of only a handful essential oils are also extremely lacking. Somtimes she'd say, this oil is usually good for xxx, but I tried just the opposite and it still worked well (paraphrase). But she offers absolutely no explanation why it still worked for her when the oil is typically used for something else. She casually uses her own experience as examples frequently, but offers no detailed explanation. Often she just says, I like this, or I don't like this. Again, no reason why she liked or disliked something. She simply doesn't sound like a professional writer to me (almost airy), and I expected a lot more from the book, especially after reading the other rave reviews. There are many books out there not even specifically focused on the subject of essential oils, but still contain much more useful & detailed information than this book. Total disappointment. Unless you're too lazy to do any online research and only want to touch the surface of what essential oils are, then this may be the book for you. Afterall, it does contain a small amount of information in an organized fashion, but I could've written this book in a week. Otherwise, don't waste your money 
 Thick towels but shed, even after washing. Don't wash with anything else but other towels. Seem to have good color saturation. Nothing special, but better than most discount store brands. I'd probably pay a little more for better quality next time 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 This book is incredibly boring and tedious to read.  It has no plot; I fell asleep every time I tried to read it.  It isn't realistic, as some attest, becuase the Indians have the ability to talk to animals.  Remarkably, their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies; James Welch takes foreshadowing a little too far.  A final warning: this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts, including adultery and incest 
 I have been reading the Anita books and loved it ever since Guilty Pleasures. That is why I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I'm halfway through the book already and still there's not even a hint of a big bad. After the scene at the club, it's like 200 pages of repetative sex scene nonsense. I found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter. It feels like LKH ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into 5 chapters. I mean the curing Gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg... If the remaining books are like this, I think I'm going to pass it. AND Anita is getting to be so annoying. Whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore 
 this book was very disappointing, it is a very limited point of view written for a committed male/female couple and no one else, also only talks about "domestic discpline" not really about the BDSM mindset.  I really didn't learn a thing from this about truely creating a scene and understanding your sub 
 I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it.  I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well.  Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author.  I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much.  This book is going on my "Do Not Lend" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense.  
 I was very excited to read this book, as I studied forensic anthropology in college. Within the first chapters, I became very disappointed. The only reason for me to continue reading this is because I have no other books. I read the reviews that this isn't the best example from the author but I will hesitate when buying another one of her books. It is boring, easy to put down, and an overall slow read 
 Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization. The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers. I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra "I told you so." Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow. So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.   There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past. So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again. Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now 
 I was looking for a step by step process, but this book isn't written that way. If you're looking for a step by step process..this isn't it. One thing I don't like about this book is that it's more like stories of the authors patients and also the author keep saying I will talk about something in chapter so and so, I talked about it in chapter so and so....sign of a bad self help book 
 This cake mix book is based on the concept of creating beautiful cakes using prepared cake mixes. It is a nice idea, especially for those who would be willing to sacrifice a bit of taste for convenience.  However, many of the recipes in this book are little more than your cake mix with some fruity/sugary sauce or colorful icing decoration slathered on it. The icing designs look cute in a crayon drawing, but look a bit scary on a food item. Since since these designs are targeted for kids, this is a bit worrisome because that is a lot of food coloring for a little kid's liver to process, not to mention the amount of sugar in that much icing.  Just be sure to read up on diabetes before you crack open this book. Health aside, the book does have colorful photos. The photos illustrate the main focus of the book - few of the cakes actually look exquisite, but they're all cheerfully colored and cute looking. The book is perfect for those who don't mind their cakes ending up with similar taste but enjoy just a moment of sugar high amid the cuteness. For those who relish the freshness and tenderness of a real chocolate cake, who possess a more nuanced ability to distinguish the sweetness between fruits and high fructose corn syrup, prepare to look elsewhere. 
 I thought this book would be so helpful to me, an artist looking for a tolerable day job while I continue to pursue my career.  Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment.  I took the quiz and it identified me as a type which I honestly don't agree with.  Most of the recommended jobs were neither interesting nor creative.  The rest were impossibly out of reach, such as symphony conductor or State Director of Natural Resources (I mean come on - there are only 50 in the nation and they are political appointees).  The last straw was when it recommended my current position - a job in which I am slowly dying from lack of stimulation 
 If you want aran knitting, buy "Aran Sweater Design" by Janet Szabo, "The Best of Knitter's Aran & Celtics" or"Aran Knitting" by Alice Starmore, those are excellent books, this book lack originality and good information. The 'one star' is for the photographer 
 Mike Wallace has been engaged in his so- called hard- hitting journalism for years. But anyone who has studied Wallace close-up knows he has engaged repeatedly in some of the most dishonest of all journalist practices. In the late eighties his crew was caught paying Palestinian youths to throw rocks at Israeli soldiers. This provided good film footage. Wallace's most recent interview which is not included in this book is a perfect illustration of the dishonesty in another way. The very same week Wallace interviewed him Ahmadinejad spoke in Iran before a screaming hystircal audience. He ranted against the United States and said how it would fall apart. But his most bitter cursings were for Israel and he repeatedly shouted to his audience , in Hitlerlike fashion 'Death to Israel'  Now switch to the interview. Wallace says Ahmadinejad is personable , does question him about his Holocaust denial, but lets him off relatively easily. There is no mention of proposed genocide, or politicide, only that Ahmadinejad is against the 'Zionists'  Years ago watching Wallace I noticed how insulting and aggressive he could be with those who did not share his political views.  Edward R. Murrow he is not. 
 This would of been a great sd card had it actually had a list of actual devices that it was compatible with...from the description, my mda should of been but alas it wasnt...this is a very forseeable problem, im not sure why such an obivous issue such as compatibiltiy went unchecked by amazon and transcend....very dissapointin 
  You people are all idiots, you burn loving a disgusting nation into innocent children's heads who know nothing better.  Go see the innocent bodies strewn across the floor in foreign lands due to America and tell your children to bless America in their prayers.  To hell with you all 
 There are no really good songs on this cd.  i am not writing an indepth review of each song because all are just self indulgences for Kate Bush.  This is an ode to her ego.  The only true great cd which I bought 3 copies were 'The Hounds of Love'.  Nearly every song was great.  And the video of 'cloudbursting' from the cd was wonderful with an apperance by Donald Sutherland as her father.  Her next album , I beleive 'Ruberband Girl' had one good song written for an 80's movie 'She's having a Baby' called 'This Woman's work' as the only great song and a few were decent.    But her new CD is frankly bad.  But since I loved 'Hounds of Love' so much, I still have hope for Kate and gave her two stars.  Just don't stay away fromm the studio so long.  It's like everything else, practice and perfect your kraft or lose the talent 
 I would really want to give this book 0 stars. Zero, zip, nada, nothing... Because that's what it's worth.  It's about the worst book I've ever read.   From the adolescent writing, the missing plot, the stupid drawings, the made up words (what's with the -'s and the /'s anyway), the enormous font used, it's a big waste of time to read.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for blood, gore, suspense and plenty of porn and sex. For en eye opener; read Matthew Stokoe's two books instead - Cows and High Life 
 I made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils.  If you can buy the karaoke version, this might be pretty good, otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest Yanni cd.  The vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame 
 I have to say i am disappointed, Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon.   the one i received was much cheaper in quality. The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped. The guide shattered. There is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 I can find.  Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.  On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is incredible. 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 Do yourself a favor... read FATHERLAND by Robert Harris instead if you like this sort of thing.  I was very, very disappointed with how predictable this book was.  It was written with the knowledge of what happened, but not written as if the characters didn't know what happened.  I give it a 2 stars instead of a 1 because I liked how Kerr handled some of his descriptions of Berlin, but I would not recommend Kerr, and this series, to anyone 
 Stoner begins by warning that unscientific books written by Christians bring discredit upon Christianity and drive non-Christians away from the Gospel. Unfortunately, following this thinking, Stoner may be a major culprit. He simply accepts standard uniformitarian thinking as fact. His treatment of dating methods appears to show a complete misunderstanding of them. He says, for instance, that the circular reasoning of using fossils is obviated by the fact that fossils are used for dating only when they first have been shown to agree with isotopic dates. First of all, index fossils, and the concepts behind using them, were used for over a century before isotopic dating even existed. Second, one of the major ways that dating results are evaluated for presumed reliability is their agreement with relative dating based on index fossils. Consequently, the circular reasoning still stands 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off.  The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume.  Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm.  A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash 
 You have to ask yourself, "Why did William Grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary?".  As you read the book, the answer comes quickly, before you're even very far into the "A's"... apparently he didn't. I was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory, often puerile definitions which accompany most of the 2000 culinary terms Grimes presents.  The simplistic line or two of text each are accompanied by are often incomplete and sometimes down right misleading. The introduction builds up the book as a necessary tool to help we little folk through the growing complexities of modern food buying and eating.  In a world no longer dominated by a few French terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between old-school cooking books (say, from before 1990) and the current state of culinaria.  Why then are so many of the terms defined in an out-dated, even archaic mind-set? Take  the term "brown sugar".  This book says it is "unrefined or partially refined sugar", a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago.  Today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed, and Grimes should know the difference.  The are innumerable other examples available in the same vein. Additionally, Grimes give us  "food lists" scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them.  For example, there is a list of Varieties of Apples.  48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking.  Sure "Red Delicious" apples have an insipid definition in the "R" section but what about the more interesting varieties like "Sundowner", or "Lodi" apples?  No further mention of them can be found in the book.  There is also a huge list of  "Fish and Seafood" but if you are intrigued by what the "Geoduck" or "Sprat" listed might be, you're out of luck (without running to a REAL culinary dictionary). The bright (if limited) spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history.  There are 7 of them (reprints from other publications and various authors) that are each informative and interesting.  Grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject. My guess is that the brevity of the definitions (leading to rampant deficiencies) was, perhaps, an attempt at simplicity but the effective "dumbing-down" of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader.  I know that Grimes, a former restaurant reviewer for the New York Times, must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound.  Grimes is listed as the "editor" of this work (along with a number of others) and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary. Unfortunately, my copy of this book is destined for "re-gifting" or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable, dog-eared Larousse Gastronomic retains it's place of honor near my desk. Bon appetite, ex libris, and caveat emptor. DH 
 Unix in a Nutshell is not for the faint-hearted.  It tries to be a concise reference on Unix but ends up being incomplete (esp. with regard to Linux).  A lot of commands are explained cursorily without complete options or examples.  The presentation is often confusing; witness the chapters on shell programming.  If you know nothing about Unix, don't even consider this book; it'll get you nowhere and more frustrate than ever.  If you already know Unix you can find better and more accurate Unix references elsewhere 
 I had to read this for a class.  I just could not get into this story.  I normally love to read but this book just could not cut it.  I would not continue reading this book by choice.  I will be glad to be done with it.  The instructor could have picked a better book.  No one else in the class cares for this book either.  A waste of my money.  J. is an annoying character.   Couldn't care less about him... 
 i have wanted a carpenters christmas album for 3 years now and finally got it for christmas this year as a gift.  it was a gigantic dissapointment!  i did not want all the other music in there with it i just wanted the Carpenters!  i did not review the cd on line to see what it involved but someone else bought it for me!  anyway HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!  great songs but like i said I just wanted the carpenters!

 The book is an easy read, which is good.  You'll have an easy time getting through the questions, but when you go to take the test you'll fail.  This book is no where a good match for the exam.  I suggest this book for people who want to learn about Win2k3 AD, but if you're getting it to prepare for the test you should think twice.  Nothing this book discuss could have prepared me for the test.  Bummer 
 It's sooo easy to take a cheap shot and say that Anne Bird wrote this to finance her wine/carpaccio/Disneyland/Xanax habit, but if she did, that's okay.  Catherine Crier wrote a brilliant book about the Peterson case and I doubt all the proceeds are going to charity.  But what to make of this poorly written and not-terribly-well-thought-out book?  First of all, Ms. Bird clearly has some issues with being adopted, though why I don't know--her adoptive parents are loving, supportive, and RICHRICHRICH, as she takes pains to alert us.  I guess she's annoyed that Scott was considered the family "golden boy," though in my experience those kids generally end up worse than their siblings.  (My spouse has an acquaintance whose mother also considered him the "golden boy" and who could do no wrong--she even defended him when he put his own brother in the hospital.  He'll probably end up in court one day and his mother will be there pulling a Jackie Peterson).  But Ms. Bird just LOVES everybody when she first meets them, although she makes sure to tell us "I know it seems as if I liked everybody indiscriminately, but I'm actually not that way" (not a direct quote, obviously).  She thinks some aspects of Jackie Peterson's behavior is creepy--though it struck me that Mrs. Peterson was probably just awkward in the situation, who wouldn't be?--but nonetheless she and the Petersons go on trips to Disneyland, the shore, fancy restaurants, etc.  She proclaims that she and Laci are practically soul sisters though they meet about four times and only rarely talk on the phone.  Despite Ms. Bird's avowal that the purpose of her book is to "get justice for Laci and Conner" (this was accomplished at the trial, Anne!) Laci is a cardboard character who likes flowers, shopping, and complains about her aching back.    There are some interesting tidbits about Scott and the rest of the Peterson clan, which saves the book from a 1-star rating.  We already knew about his porn channels, of course, but the pattern of silly lies (like claiming he and Laci were going to name the baby "California"--Anne hilariously writes "I didn't know what to make of that"), going out boozing with Anne while the search is going on, Jackie's defense of Scott's lies to Amber Frey with "Well, he's been all those places!"--if it weren't for the fact that a woman and her unborn baby are dead, these people would make wonderful Springer or Maury guests.  This includes Ms. Bird, who sits watching "Murder, She Wrote," neglecting her kids and jeopardizing her marriage because "He's my brother."  I'd argue that her adoptive siblings are her "brothers," but I guess she feels differently.  Her "33 reasons" are pretty ludicrous (Laci was almost certainly NOT killed in the pool) consisting primarily of such insights that Scott Peterson was at Cal Poly when Kristen Smart disappeared (again, almost certainly not a connection), Scott making "flirtinis" for the babysitter and getting into the Mile-High club (again, chilling details, but not dispositive).  She also "reads" guilt into a tale Scott weaved for her regarding a children's cemetery that he and Laci supposedly stumbled on and a vision that Scott had of Laci.  Again, Scott's guilty--but these stories don't really tell us much that we don't get in Catherine Crier's far superior book.       As for dissembling, Anne Bird proves she's not above it herself.  We are asked to believe that upon hearing Laci is dead, her three-year-old son takes his crib mattress and tries to drag it outside saying, "I'm going to put this outside for Aunt Laci for when she falls down from the heavens."  PLEASE!  Also, for all her talk about believing Scott to be innocent at first, she seems curiously eager to get involved in the case.  She had absolutely no useful information to give either the defense or the prosecution (seems like she tried one, then the other) and when she failed to get her sufficient 15 minutes of fame, she hitches her wagon to Gloria Allred and peddles her stories in this book.  If you can borrow a friend's copy or check it out of the library, it's a fun read if you were a Peterson trial junkie (which probably includes most of the country). Again, stories of the wildly dysfunctional Petersons would be funnier if Laci and Connor weren't horribly dead...but Anne's working out her "adoptee" issues, so I guess it's all right.  Uhhh-huhhh.....       
 I think this book is made up of a bunch of baloney.  I don't believe a word of it.  I think that way too much importance is placed on sex, to the point of being obsessed with it. It's about a bunch perverts, in my opinion.  The author's interest and obsession with sex is not normal.  It appears she thinks of nothing else in life, except sex, and who to have it with 
 Wow. This is a BAD film. Where to begin? The young cast is talented and appealing but the writing completely lets these talented youngsters down. Was it written for 14-year-olds or by 14-year-olds? Comparing it to those shallow but well-intentioned ABC after-school specials from the 70s is insulting to the latter. Also, it is incredibly offensive that 25 years after "Fame" we still are subjected to the sad, doomed Paul McCrane gay character (who cross-dresses, naturally), living unrequited and unfulfilled -- in the final scenes he must content himself with watching the straight boy and girl find the happiness denied him. Todd Graff's heart is obviously in the right place, but please Todd, hire a real writer of some depth next time. The score is marvelous, however, and deserves a better film. There are some rare comic moments, but not enough to recommend this film. In fact, adults should stay away from this stinker, only musical theater teens and pre-teens could possibly find this film engaging 
 This book is very poorly written.  There are many typographical errors throughout the book and many, many inaccuracies in the content.  Some terms are used incorrectly and instead of assisting the reader in learning civil litigation, it creates confustion and frustration.  I would not recommend this book to anyone - especially students.  I hope the new edition is worth the paper it's written on 
 This book is difficult and needs better interpretation.  If I thought it was so difficult to read and understand, I wouldn't have bothered to buy.. 
 The plot was interesting, but less complicated than I expected it would be based on other reviews, and the "surprise" killer was evident from the beginning. The story is gruesome, but not as terrifying as it could be, and not shocking considering what else is available in prose and reality now. The writing was choppy and pedestrian, reminiscent of a high school short story with certain words replaced by "thesaurus alternatives." In such a common joe book, why use "masticated" instead of "eaten"? The book is written as a screenplay and would make a better movie than a novel. Also, the author continually quotes T.S. Eliot without explanation of why the character has these complex, provocative thoughts and only names Eliot as the author of the phrases in an author's note at the back of the book. Elsewhere in the book he uses "Only that and nothing more" as his own words, almost word for word the well known writing of Edgar Allen Poe ("Only this, and nothing more."-The Raven ) Recently another author's work was pulled from the shelves for using such similarities of "internalized" work. Not worth the time, read a spoiler if you want to hear the story. It only took me a few hours to burn through the book given its low level and I wasn't terrified, thrilled or surprised 
 Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
 What a total waste of money this was. I'd been after a frother, having used one at a friend's house (but not knowing the brand name) - it looked similar to a Bodum coffeemaker, with a thick metal-and-plastic layered base on a metal rod, within a glass beaker.  This thing, however, doesn't even come close. The glass beaker is okay, but the base is plasticky, and the frother end of the mechanism is simply a very thin, wobbly circle of white plastic with some holes in it.   Pumping it for 3 minutes, and still - minimal, weak froth (and I'm using full fat milk!), not enough for one small cappuccino.  Useless piece of junk. Don't waste your money 
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 I had hoped that this would be a cool film, but as with many of Hollywoods films, it just flat out sucked beyond words that could define it. Basically what we have here is an empty, hollow flim with a miniscule plot.Really though,Smokin' Aces is a huge rip off of other films that were made long ago,and done 100 times better such as Resevior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock and two Smoking Barels and Snatch to name a few. None of the characters were interesting in the least bit and I was astonished that Ray Liotta, Ryan Renolds, Ben Affleck and Alisha Keys(I think that's who it was?) agreed to do this film.If I were them(if we could switch identities for a day) I would have fired my agent for even offering this piece of gragage to me. The film tries to be "ultra cool and stylish" again ripping off the the film formulas of originals done long ago. What it does succeed at doing is making "sleezy,scummy people trendy and cool",yeah...great message.The Neo Nazi Hit men, the crooked cops turned hitmen,the two female assassins and the assasin who makes masks to disguise himself,"I mean...come on!"How much stupider does this film have to get?Well,it doesn't stop there,it all comes complete with an FBI government conspiracy to tie everything in so the unbelievable plot makes sense.I'm all for fiction and fantasy, even for enjoying films that are made soly for entertainment reasons.However,when Hollywood tries to push this kind of stuff onto people by showing some flashy trailers and making the film out to be something it isn't,it can't get much lower,or cheaper than that.I wish I never rented this DVD, it was a total disappointment(not to mention money) and I'm hoping that I can save the rest of you out there from making the same mistake that I did. Avoid Smokin' Aces at all costs, it isn't worth the money that its printed on 
 Aesop's fables are interesting, but I wouldn't try to read too many of them at once.  I am currently reading this edition of Aesop's fables.  If I have to read any more animal stories, I may have to pick up a copy of  "Final Exit."  The author's notes, however, make this edition  almost worth the time 
 Really, I'd give negative stars if it was possible.  Before I get going, I'd like to point out that I've always liked Douglas Niles's DL works, The Last Thane aside.  In particular, I'd recommend Fistandantilus Reborn, The Kinslayer Wars, and Emperor of Ansalon as excellent examples of how good a writer her can be in this setting...even if each has slight flaws, they don't add up enough to detract from the book.  In Wizard's Conclave, it seems like all there are, are flaws.  As far as the issue of Dalamar the Dark's hair color, he WAS killed and resurrected.  The shock of that COULD have bleached his hair - it happens in real life sometimes when people experience a severe trauma.  That was the least of it in my mind.  For starters, the heroine (Coryn) was far too naive and STUPID throughout the book.  The idea that a kender could just show up (in Icereach, of all places, without being a god, as in The Icewall Trilogy) at Scharon's door and guide a 15-year old girl to Palanthas WITHOUT INCIDENT is ludicrous.  Plain and simple.  Any ship they took would have had to pass close enough to the Gale off the coast of Southern Ergoth to experience negative weather patterns from its fallout, yet we hear nothing of a storm-tossed ship or anything.  Just smooth sailing!  Secondly, the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth has a whole big piece of source material on it (Raistlin's Legacy: The Tower of High Sorcery) that was readily available to Mr. Niles that he apparently didn't look at once.  Wayreth Forest is just that, a forest.  No caves, no mountains, NO SECRET TUNNELS! It is guarded by a COPPER dragon, not some massive green holdover from the Third Dragon War.  It is also a structure that CANNOT be harmed.  Raistlin, in Test of the Twins, was a god in an alternate future and even his DIVINE power couldn't harm it, never mind some wild magic.  The villain was, in a word, boring.  The writing was kiddie (he should have named Coryn Harriet Potter and just have been done with it) and there were so many problems that they got in the way of telling a good story.  Not the least of which is the idea that every wizard had the "fly" spell memorized for every day use or that they suddenly had a full compliment of spells after years of having no access to them.  Oh, and lest I forget, they made good time from all corners of the continent, all arriving at the SAME EXACT TIME the day AFTER the Night of the Eye.  I wasn't aware Ansalon had Leer jets.  The Master of the Tower has his own form, but it was not once used, and is more powerful than just about any wizard because he IS the Tower.  Why he didn't lock the villain and his toadying sidekick in a room and allow them to suffocate is beyond me.  The Tower's physical layout was incorrectly described, or should I say incompletely described.  No mention was made of where the fence went from the foretower.  And for all of Coryn's unbelievable (literally) powers, she HAD to use her little copycat spell on that arrow to win? What about, oh, I dunno, casting a haste spell on the arrow so it would get there before Kalwhatshisname had time to turn around?  Was there anything about this book I liked? Yes, actually.  I liked that Jenna became the Head of the Conclave, even if she's far too old to have withstood the punishment she took.  She was no spring chicken in Dragons of Summer Flame as it was, yet here she is 40+ years later and still running around like she was in the prime of her life.  Even Elminster would have a problem bouncing back from the kind of injuries she sustained!  The best part, though, was the scene with Palin and Dalamar.  I felt that it was an excellent closing of the book on the Majere family (Linsha aside) and their involvement with the future of Krynn.  Palin sacrificed magic at the end of the War of Souls trilogy and in this book - released shortly after Prisoner of Haven and, thus, a great piece of loose-end-tying - we see him happy for the first time in years.  A family that rose from peaceful common stock returns to peaceful common stock...a great way to bring their saga full circle.  In short, though, Mr. Niles took far too many liberties with the story, not the least of which was betraying the tone of DL with a kiddie fantasy story, dialogue sequences, and pace.  As I said, though, I like Doug Niles's DL stuff, by and large, and will just be forced to file this in the Miss category for him...which is still far outnumberd by his Hits.  I really hope that he phoned this in due to personal feelings towards the story idea and the supposed story arc that is supposed to come with it.  Coryn is rumored to feature prominently in his upcoming trilogy...I can only hope he doesn't continue the trend established in this book, but rather takes the story seriously and attempts to make the read not only fun, but worthwhile as well 
 the very thesis of this book is disturbing, and added with the fact that some people are ignorant enough to believe it is just shocking.  my grandparents are survivors of Auschwitz and have the tatoos to prove it, they lived through the nightmare along with many many others- including elie wiesel, who wrote/spoke extensively about his experiences at the hands of the nazis.  that anyone would actually believe this anti-genocidal propoganda is beyond me, should we next begin to disbelieve that the rwandan genocide happened? what about pol pots slaughter of millions?  this book is not worth any history teachers-such as myself- time, no matter how much you want to look at all sides of the picture to paint an authentic historical scene for your students.  
 People who enjoy this book seem to characterize it as an original work of sci-fi/fantasy and a thought-provoking exploration of insanity, which interests me very much.  However, I found this book to be neither original nor an adequate account of someone's "descent" into or recovery from madness.  The premise is intriguing enough as the novel begins, gradually revealing the story of an amnesiac/schizophrenic patient being admitted to a psych ward, who turns out to be a professor at Cambridge.  Immediately, the reader is thrown into 50 pages or so of stream of conciousness ramblings that were quite frankly difficult to trudge through.  This put a bad taste in my mouth, possibly tainting the rest of the book for me.  The remainder really wasn't terribly interesting; I found Lessing's writing style to be excruciatingly boring and lacking any sort of insight.  Other reviews of this book tend to fall to the extremes of loving it or hating it; I guess that means I hated it.  So maybe I just didn't "get" it...personally, I don't think there was anything to "get".  
 I find it very amazing that if you click on the "See my all reviews" box that these same people also highly recommend all the other books by the same author?  WOW imagine that! Type in the names Harris H. McIlwain and Debra Fulghum Bruce in a search engine and see the 100 other books these people have in print. They sound like the experts for every sickness and illness known to man.  There is some good advice, but nothing new here, snake-oil at best like so many books on the market.   
 Recently i've been looking to buy a cheap curling iron. i came across this one and thought vidal sassoon was a brand that's been around for a while. well. after "curling" my hair it just looked like i poorly straightend it. seriously. i am taking this back immediatly. don't waist your money or your time on this. maybe if you have thinner hair it would work. i dont know. 
 I was interested in learning more about Savonarola because "The Palace" by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro is set in Renaissance Florence at the time of Savonarola, who plays a part in the novel. Now I love history and read a lot of history books, unfortunately, this book was a big dissapointment. Contrary to the blurb on the back cover this book is hardly riveting nor is it much of a thriller. It only covers the last few years of Savonarola's life but it is more about the political history of Florence than on Savonarola himself. Actually the book does not really seem to have a direction or a point and I could not figure out why the author wrote this.   I would suggest that if you are interested in this book that you find a copy in a book store and read it before you buy otherwise you risk being dissapointed 
 If you like trashy, you'll love it.  I like a little more romance. This was more soft porn! I didn't see the romance, only the physical relationship.  It was okay 
 I managed to watch only one of the 39 shows presented on this series.  The second episode began to fall apart into digital clutter and finally quit playing altogether.  This is unfortunate -- the first episode was actually of interest and the series promised many hours of entertainment.  As I have learned, to my chagrin -- if there is a quality problem with one dvd or cd, there is a strong likelihood that the others in the production run will have the same issue.   In short, there is a reason for the low cost of this item, and one gets what one pays for.  Don't count on being lucky like other reviewers -- my recommendation is you avoid this until the company announces that they have fixed the quality problems 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 yes, i bought this & read it. wel, it may make you feel less like it's "your fault!" if you're infertile, but it's important to know the facts. most women menstrate into their 50s, but become infertile between 38-42. your chances of conceiving w/ your own eggs, even with ivf, after 43 is like 0.02%, OR, in layman's terms, not good. NONE of these fertility books tell you that. and for every woman, like the author of "Inconceivable," which I also read, who conceive, literally hundreds more won't. the moviestars over 40, like Geena Davis, who you see in redbook, etc., are getting pregnant through IVF with DONOR eggs.  but they don't tell anyone, keeping the pregnant over 40 myth going.... i guess there's a lot o shame w/ infertility, which leads to people like me casting about for answers since "it worked for them," thinking, "if only i could drink as much wheatgrass as HER!!!" & "ooo! what's HER secret, and how much will she charge me for it?"  (bye the bye, i found the book "inconceivable" terribly upsetting and sad & not helpful. plus, she was trying for her 2nd baby, and hearing her whine feels like a slap when YOU think she's so lucky to even have 1!)  one "bit" of "magic" i did find... acupuncture. it regulated my cycle, and going twice a week can improve a man's sperm by 60% research shows. plus it's relaxing and AFFORDABLE, which Dr. Domar's programs (I live near her LA branch) aren't. otherwise, save your money, or join RESOLVE (www.resolve.org)and maybe you can "book swap" with fellow members... my best advice, go to a reproductive endocrinologist asap, & find out what's really happening. it set our minds at ease, even though all the news wasn't good. most importantly... strive to keep your relationship happy and loving and sexy.  hang in there; you have my entire sympathy & empathy. good luck & i wish all of us babies :) 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 It's important for buyers and readers to understand, first and foremost, that this is a text book.  You can read in the prelude that this book was the result of teaching in the classroom.  Because of this certain aspects of the book are useful to new systems programmers, namely the heavy emphasis on examples and excercises.  However, the examples are so large and the is text built around them that you don't get a wide enough understanding of the topic.  If your the sort of person who can actually read from cover to coder without jumping around this might work out fine, but for most of us we don't want to read full chapters at a time.    Because of this, this book doesn't cut it as a reference.  You read it, you put it on yourself and you find a good reference to put on your desk (Teer or Stevens').    Topics like POSIX Threading are great to have, but it's too big a topic for most systems programming books and pushes out alot of good information in order to facility these larger topics.  This really kills the book.  Don't think that you can buy this book and then avoid buying a POSIX Threads book; you'd be far better off to buy a more thurough programming book (Teer or Stevens') and then suppliment it with a good solid PThreads book.  One thing that really really bugs me about this book is that it does not dissuse UNIX memory in any detail.  There is a small section that explains stacks and heaps, but outside of that there is little memory discussion at all.  Topics such as secure programming are scarcely touched, despite being an independant topic.  If you want a good ol' college textbook, complete with examples that aren't all that interesting and lots of "Real World(tm)" discussion then by all means nab this book.  But if your a real systems programmer or are trying to become one, do yourself a favor and buy a real systems programming book (Teer or Stevens') and leave this book on the shelf.  I bought this book about 6 months ago and already it's sitting on my bookshelf of unused texts.  I'd suggest to anyone looking for a Systems Programming text to strongly look at "Solaris Systems Programming" for a far better and comprehensive book 
 Lynn Hall's "Dog Showing For Beginners" is fine for explaining the class structure, point system and politics but totally ignores the mechanics of dog showing. Information on the physical training and handling  of your dog is not to be found.  The book in two words "amusing  fluff" 
 I was very disappointed with Feed Your Kids Well. This is an Atkins/Low Carbohydrate type diet that excludes most fruits and vegetables. The book is filled with list of "off limit" foods and only 6-7 time consuming recepies. All meals must be made from scratch and everyday  children should be eating eggs for breakfas! What if your child does not  like eggs?  The author is unclear on what children should be eating. His  suggestions seem unrealistic (especiall for working parents) and his  exclusion of most fruits and vegetables seems more of a "fad  diet" than a healty solution to a difficult problem many parents with  little time face 
 This A6 size book(HtoSS} while OK on basic scanning techniques ,is very deficient on twins and triplets, but these are what you need to solve the difficult puzzles in mags, books, and papers. You need to know the how, when, and where of these and all variations.This book only has one instructional diagram on them, seeming to just mention them in passing. The only easy to understand guide that covers them properly is 'So Do Sudoku' (SDS) which has ten instructional diagrams on them.Also the intermediate technique in HtoSS is covered easier and better by an alternative scanning technique in SDS. All these books have been said to be useless by people who assume everyone else is up to their level, when in fact these books are written for the majority of people who struggle with the puzzles in general circulation, and contain tips to help you complete them. None of them are useless to the right people ,but some are better than others. 
 Right-Wing Women?   Poor research.  Bad categorization.  Try again 
 This albums mad wack  Manson's mad wack  Goth rock's mad wack  P.S. To the loser who responded to me on that review i last wrote you might wanna actually listen to Tupac, you know instead of being an ignorant f*ck. Tupac was known more than anything for sticking up for his people in his lyrics. The crimes he talked about weren't things he had done, he grew up around that which makes him a true artist. He sent out powerful messages which helped millions of people in life and talked about real life issues. Oh yeah and you don't even know how he died, you don't know who your paying out so i suggest you be silent you goth rock poser. Step your game up, u call that tainted love bullcrap good, Tupac's Dear Mama could murder that song in cold blood. To all the goths who hate me for writing this review i don't give a flying fig what you think. Go ahead, respond to me, that's of course if you like being laughed at, silly question: all goth rock posers want to be laughed at. Go f*ck yourselves 
 After reading the book I had no real clue how to build a boat which was why I bought the book in the first place. I think it would make sense to maby not call a book complete hand book of wooden boats when it is not  complete. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 Fast, easy, not-too-techincal read.  The Title is misleading.  The book is about race. It is a political screed the basis of which is that racial differences in the U.S. are cultural and not genetic.  The author presents scientific evidence that there is little racial difference in DNA from one race to another to show that all races have more in common than they have differences.  The book moves from science to an attack on Europeans.  According to Graves, Europeans are subjugators of others.  Those Anglo-Saxon males seem to be the worst!  Graves conveniently forgets some non-Europeans who have not done too poorly when it comes to subjugation: Ghenghis Kahn, Mao Tse Dong, Hirohito, and Pol Pot come immediately to mind.  Even some Africans have done their part: Idi Amin, Sani Abacha, Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and Zimbabwe's own Robert Mugabe, who is now "cleaning out the trash."     
 The best part of reading this book was finishing it, and turning directly to Jonathan Kozol's "Shame of the Nation".  The Thernstroms bombard readers with "facts", graphs, charts, and a whole lot of stereotypes and dangerous assumption.  For starters, they must have a different place in mind when they describe the "affluent town" of Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Clearly they've never stepped outside the Ivy walls of Harvard Square.  If they did, they would see first hand the gross injustice being done in the shadows of these walls...an urban public high school that is nowhere near the profile that they provide.  They go on to describe, with great confidence, different groups as chapter titles as crass as "Asians" "Hispanics" and "Blacks". Don't bother with this...pick up anything by Kozol, Deborah Meier, Gary Orfield, Richard Elmore, or Richard Rothstein instead 
 Having listened to Outkast since Southernplayalisticadilacmusik came out in the early 90's, I have always been excited when they drop a new album. They have always pushed the envelope and pushed hip-hop in new directions, opening new doors. But, this album simply didn't work.  There are highlights, but overall, this is a very uneven album. Most Outkast albums standup to repeated listening (Aquemini hasn't left my CD-changer since the day it came out) but most of this album gets tiresome after a few listens. Only "Church" stands up to repeated plays. The rest of the album should be taken in small doses. "Ghetto Music", "Tomb of the Boom", and "Last Call" are fun songs that I like to hear occasionally when I'm in the mood for some loud, big-beat club-style hip-hop. While "the Love Below" is certainly interesting, Andre's experimentation falls flat for the first time in his career. There are no real standout tracks on this second CD though most are listenable, but leave you thinking "Hmmmm, that was interesting and I respect you for trying something new, but..." You just aren't tempted to push that play button again right away. Compared to the hip-hop that generally gets radio airplay today, this album is better, but compared to Outkast's other work, it is a huge letdown. Southernplayalisticadillacmusik was a tempting showcase of talent that foreshadowed the good things to come, but it was pretty standard fare for southern rap at the time, although done better than most with a few hints of experimentation. (3 1/2 stars). Outakast really broke through with ATLiens with stripped down beats and ambient highs and thoughtful lyrics (5 stars). Aquemini (5 stars since that's the highest mark, but it deserves more) marked the highwater point of Outkast's career thus far. It was (and still is) an absolutely amazing album that can be held up as a standard against which others can be measured. (Only Goodie Mob's "Soul Food" is on a similar level in my opinion.) Stankonia was a bit of a drop off after Aquemini, but still an extremely solid effort with some standout tracks like "Gasoline Dreams" and "Humble Mumble." (4 Stars). But, with this latest release, Outkast seems to have lost some of the edge that made their earlier albums so great. I respect Outkast for constantly trying new things (that is what made ATLiens and Aquemini instant classics) and can understand that sometimes expiramentation will not go as planned. Given that, I look forward to thier next album and hope they can recapture the magic that made their second and third albums so amazing 
   Notwithstanding Jeff's mantra that flawless grammar and orthography are essential features of successful writers (i.e., attention to detail), it is amazing how sloppy this book is.  It boasts incorrect addresses, incomplete addresses, and sometimes, in the agent profiles sections, the "Subjects that you would most love to agent" and "Subjects that you definitely never want to agent" sections contain the same thing!  According to page 536, for example, fantasy and science fiction are both subjects that Peter Rubie would "most love to agent" and "definitely never want to agent."  Either the agent is schizophrenic, or Jeff Herman is an extraordinarily sloppy writer.  Also, this book features almost no valuable information on query letters for fiction books; this book seems to assume that all aspiring authors want to write non-fiction 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 It's an amazing phenomenon...people so smart that they are stupid.  Singer falls into that category, and I can't believe the influence this man wields.  It's mind boggling.  : /  Read this to understand his influence in our time, yes.  But don't be a sheep.  This stuff is ridiculous 
 My mother and father read this book and it enflamed them against the doctors who were trying to convince my mother that she needed to do something about her Stage II breast cancer.  She was scared to death by what she read.  Perhaps literally.  While she was scared, her cancer progressed to Stage IIIC.  We're not sure she's going to make it.  She received three opinions regarding recommended treatment from some of the best hospitals/doctors in the U.S.  Then the cancer spread to her breast bone area.  She is finally following doctors orders, including chemo, and her tumors are shrinking.  We pray it is not too late.  I'm sure this book has some useful information, but my mother only showed me the scary bits--the things that made her wait.  Too long?  Who knows.  Beware 
 This title sounds good but the stories do not live up to it. All three are very similiar and except for the fact that all the guys are great looking weasels, who would like a son of satan. They have all lived for  hundreds of yrs, but we are to believe that one woman can change each of their souls.   I would think that after being irristable to women all those years that they would be quite sated with the physical aspects of living, so I was looking for something abit more spiritual to reach them. But in every story it was sex that set them free of evil.  Each story was so much alike it was a chore to read. don't waste your time or money

 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 I expected Michael Savage to read on this CD himself. I have listened to his radio program and this CD version of the book missed a great deal without his inflections and style 
 Being in the asset management consulting field I thought this highly recommended title should be as insightful as Swensen's "Pioneering Portfolio Management". I found it directionless, full of unconnected pointless anecdotal comments, as well as giving misleading shallow guidance regarding indexing 
 I truly believe in the power of the mind. In so much as we can control our own thoughts we have tremendous control over our own moods and lives and can consequently impact the lives of those around us, but on a psychological level only.  The authors' attempt to link the power of thought beyond our own bodies through actual physical phenomenon, like vibration, is unscholarly at best.  The authors backup their claims with citations of the work of other "scientists", but a little investigation shows that they are simply backing up junk science with more junk science. The reference to work of Dr. Masaru Emoto's with ice crystals, for example, not only has no bearing on their subject matter, but has been discredited for its lack of scientific rigor.  Had the authors stayed in the psychological realm and not ventured into the physical sciences they might have maintained their creditability and produced a truly interesting piece of work. Unfortunately they did not.  
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 I don't know if Bob Roll thinks it is still funny after all these years to say "Tour DAY France" or if he is just stuck on stupid.  Whatever the reason, I can not get over this imbecillity to have any further concern with whatever else might be sloshing around inside his skull 
 I have ordered the items twice and still have not received it by now, because your shipping department have problem to provide the correct mailing address to DHL. 
 I was bitterly disappointed with this book. If you are not a serious number person, you will not need this book. After that, it's a list of web addresses - which you can surely find by doing a web search 
 All this book is about how the Indians and Pilgrims started Thanks giving. I read thi book when i was 8. It was alright back then.                               BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU READ THIS BOOK !!! 
 But still an OK good all round resource, albeit woefully short on design ideas.  My first reaction was that it's not the book the other reviewers read, but maybe I was too hard on it.  This is an edited review, and if I could change the number of stars, I'd give it three, anyway, having set it aside and picked it up again.  I have several other books that cover the subject very well--especially when it comes to function and design--and I've been through a remodeling, so a lot of what's in this one didn't seem new, thorough or insightful the first time I sat down with.  Probably the rave reviews by other readers created unreasonable expectations that this would have some fabulous unique insights about designing kitchens that work AS KITCHENS.  It doesn't, but it is very comprehensive when it comes to construction, working w/a contractor, avoiding on-site screw-ups, adapting kitchen layout to the spaces that surround it, etc., none of which should be given short shrift.  Maybe that's what excited the other reviewers; guess that's the main perspective and expertise of the authors.  It would be quite useful for someone who has not spent as many months [years, maybe] studying the subject and been through multiple additions and remodelings.  Don't buy this one for design ideas.  It tries, but it's not even the best when it comes to function, though you might have high expectations based on the title.  It's really pretty basic in that respect and focuses more on common mistakes that contractors find in designers' work, like 'that door is going to bump into that [wall/cabinet/doorway/etc.].  The most thorough book on my shelf when it comes to kitchen function [i.e., making using it efficient and comfortable] is good old (1980) Build Your Harvest Kitchen (Rodale Press).  For creative design ideas, try DK Home Design Workbooks: Kitchen.  For innovative, high style ideas, try Terence Conran Kitchens: The Hub of the Home.  Another good one is Kitchen Redos, Revamps, Remodels, and Replacements: Without Murder, Suicide, or Divorce; also the New Kitchen Idea Book.  I also have and like Joan Kohn's It's Your Kitchen.  My current kitchen is based on ideas pulled from everywhere, including pages ripped from obscure magazines and stuff I found on the web.  If you're not as inclined as I am to cast a wide net, maybe at least these brief comments will lead you to a book or two that will meet your needs.  This might be one of them--if you're handing the contruction details yourself 
 I guess I'll never hear another Chicago II, III, or V again. I even liked Chicago 17. There was still enough rock and upbeat jazz (We Can Stop The Hurtin; Stay the Night; Along Comes A Woman). Oddly enough, sap songwriter Cetera leaves the group but the sappy stuff not only survives, but it dominates.  No more jazz. No more R & B. Just pop music for the masses.  Since it's been 15 years since the last "new" release, I guess I'll be dead (or close to it) before the next one. As far as I'm concernced, their best work is way behind them.  So long Chicago. 
 Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe 
 I was disappointed with this book.  I didn't learn anything new from reading this book, which was really disappointing.  For the price, it's just not thorough.  There are many other books on the subject that offer the same advice and are a better value for your money.  If I'd have had the chance to flip through this first I would not have spent the money on this book.  Over-rated and over-priced.  
 I have been looking for a good cheese plane, and this one isn't it.  It works fine for rubbery semi-soft cheeses like swiss, but not for harder cheese like cheddar, which tend to crrumble before I can finish a slice.  The problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid.  It should be thin and flexible.  Also, don't let the name fool you.  This utensil is made in China, a country which consumes very little cheese 
 The CD set is 3 hour  it has the feel of a bad Human Resource  video on office rules. It is read from scipts and sounds as such ....10  minutes into the First CD I ejected it from my Car's CD player.....  Even in a captive environment ......it got the "boot" 
 This is not a software engineering text. The author does not talk about how to write better programs. Instead he addresses how engineers might produce better numerical data to give management more control over the software development process.   The book readily admits that the methods only work well when an identifiable customer is able to provide an accurate and detailed problem statement. Perhaps in some isolated cases this may be so.   The author relies heavily on statistical methods. This may be comforting to management schooled in 6 sigma methodology. However it is bound to make an experienced engineer feel like a production unit on a software manufacturing line.  The book is extremely dry and tedious. The author does not know how to hold the reader's attention. He tends to ramble on for many pages before getting around to making a very small point.   The material may be useful in some isolated cases, but for most, the evidence isn't abundant that the benefit justifies the effort 
 all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started.  We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STO 
 I saw the movie a few years back, enjoyed it, and recently bought the sound track....  What a disappointment!  As I listened to the sound track, I realized yet again that Joy Division WAS Madchester and all the other tracks (with the possible exception of the New Order tracks) are just filler.  The no-name bands are awful.  Without Joy Division there would be no 24 Hour Party People worth remembering.  So I wish I had bought a Joy Division album instead of this 
 Several years ago, Republican Findley lost a congressional election to now-Senator, Democrat Dick Durbin. Whose fault was it? Why the Jews, of course! Borrow this from the library, along with "They Dare To Speak Out," and you'll find that Findley is nothing more than a bitter ex-politico, looking for someone to blame for his electoral ineptitude 
 Peter Lance is just another sensationalist who spouts misinformation at every opportunity ...hoping to lead you the reader, or perhaps an American seeking truth, down the path of distraction and outright fantasy.  Maybe he took lessons from his previous employer, a CIA controlled TV network ...or maybe Karl Rove of the Bush administration.  Either way, if you really want to know the truth about 911, read some David Ray Griffin, or get one of Eric Huschmid's DVD/videos.  As for Peter Lance, well ...if you have time for fiction and more government spin, then by all means, please help yourself to an extra big serving of the same 
 Just about the most useLESS book I have ever bought.  The coverage is way too broad and general. There are little to NO specific areas covered. Just general information that can be obtained in the owners manual that comes with the vehicle. All in all, not even worth taking to the throne room. 
 I bought this DVD for my husband for Xmas.  We loved Shaolin Soccer so much, I thought it would be a great present.  We sat down to watch it on Christmas night and it would not play, in any of our DVD players.  It was only 4.99, so it's not a huge loss, but we were really looking forward to watching it.  Save your 5 bucks 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 Purchased Teenage Investor for my grandchildren but decided not to give it to them.  While the book gives a reasonable survey of the stock market it promotes the negative theme throughout that we, average investors, cannot succeed and would be better off buying mutual funds.  (So, why write a book about investing?)  This boy-writer (in my opinion) must have garnered a lot of help from dad, a lawyer, an accountant, a broker, a writer, and an editor. I read the whole book hoping to find something that read as if a teenager actually contributed, but I couldn't find it.   
 I subscibe to this magazine.  Will not renew it either!  Maybe I am too old to appreciate this periodical.  It is way overpriced even with the Amazom, and others discount 
 Meandering. Monotonous. It is properly mixed and does sound good, though. However, it's a true betrayal of Metallica's namesake.  I often compare and contrast this work with Pantera's underrated (is it still in print?) 1996 album, "The Great Southern Trendkill" and realized the truth: There's no metal here. Even Ministry's "Filth Pig" has more metal than this (and Ministry was all LOADed up on heroin at the time). It may swagger and rock occasionally but that's the problem. It just lacks a punch. I wasn't moved. I was left cold.  Needless to say that I bought this for $5 USD used. And, when I finally listened to it, my conscience led me to that eternal question and a possible answer to that question:  Q: What's the purpose for the existance of 2003's "St. Anger"?  A: To make Metallica's 90s work look damn good by comparison.  Damn shame, really 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 hm.  i found it to be rather amazing that this book was even published.  IT IS SO BAD.  the dialogue is saddening and the story is only slightly better.  stay away, otherwise you will be regretting the waste of valuable time 
 I can't recommenf this book. It only introduces very common fish. It tells very little about the fishes and the pictures are bad too because they are not photographs but drawings. This book doesn't even look good in bookself because it's so small. 
 BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.  Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.  And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all 
 The book would have been lovely if I had received the actual book I ordered. The seller - paperbookshop in the uk advertised a version of the book that they did not have in stock!! I was bitterly disappointed to receive a very poor substitute version of the book I had ordered. They did not even bother to inform me that they did not have the item I ordered and simply shipped me a book I did not order!!   This makes me not want to buy things online. I wish I had seen the other people's angry reviews earlier but I think I bought it about the same time or a little before.   They said they would reimburse any reasonable shipping costs incurred in shipping the wrong book they shipped me back but have not responded to my later emails!! so I essentially paid $$ to ship the wrong book bk!! to find out the book was actually out of stock. i had emailed to specifically ask if they did have the right version and simply packed in error but they told me I had to ship the wrong book back to get the order "processed" so they could check for me. so in the end I lost money, ended up with no book and a bad taste in my mouth. 
 This book has some nice color photographs, and is another way to get the Starbucks name out into the public.  It really is nothing about Starbucks or Passion, has a few recipies 
 "Endgame" is a crude and despicable play.  It's not a classic and a pitiable excuse of a play.  Utterly useless and does not deserve our time.  The characters are one dimensional, lacking, and unrealistic.  The plot is morally confusing and worthless.  I do not recommend 
 This book is so scattered and disjointed.  Topics don't flow, random jumps are made, and the text is written poorly to top it off.  If you're going to get a cell biology book, get Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition by Bruce Alberts.  Might be a bit thicker but for the same price you get much better information 
 I am very disappointed with this book!  Where are the pictures of some of the recipes?  The price of this book, there should be photos of how to do something not bad drawings! I found the intro to be a waste of paper also, those pictures in the hard to see yellow/orange print could of gone behind the text.  I have yet to make anything from this book that turned out, which is wierd because I can make the stuff from Gourmet Magazine with no problems!  I especially do not like reading a recipe that is turned complicated because they have to be over the top with the wording!  I cannot believe I paid for this book!  
 Like W.D. I felt that the novel was lengthy with characters that simply cluttered the landscape. Tragedy after tragedy unfolds: a kidnapping of an ellitist; a run on a bank; a near-stock market crash; Hong Kong's world-famous floating restaurant catches fire, burns, and sinks; a mud-slide that destroys a prominent hotel; a chinese-communist espionage plot; a soviet espionage plot; secret-agents, double-agents, triple agents (do I need to go on)! All of this occurring within ten days, but the reader loses sense of the time since the book is so time consuming. I was fascinated with Clavell's Taipan and was further interested in the exploits of the Struan family. This was a disppointment! Dunross, the present Taipan, moves through novel with a killer business instinct and brief instances of compassion and humanity. Why does he do it? He is trying to live up to a legacy. That's it. In one sentence that is as deep as Dunross goes. The novel Taipan was so different in development of its characters. Dunross'one-sentence purpose for living, when contrasted with Dirk Struan's vision of the Noble House helping China become a world power was completely lacking. Clavell's earlier work was very insightful about China especially in its potential influence. However, the parade of characters in Noble House is similar to a chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant: plenty of food, but lacking in authentic taste. Overall the work was very tiring and uninspiring. Nothing noble about it at all.   
 As an epidemiologist with a PhD, and a focus on adolescent health, I found this book terrible.  Dr. Meeker states things that are simply WRONG and have been shown in scientific literature.  Specifically on page 146 she says that "the risk of contracting and STD through oral is extremely high." At the time of publication of her book, this was NOT shown.  Since that time, the most definitive study shows that there is no risk: del Romero J, Marincovich B, Castilla J, Garcia S, Campo J, Hernando V, et al. Evaluating the risk of HIV transmission through unprotected orogenital sex. AIDS 2002;16(9):1296-7.    Moreover, several studies have shown that virginity pledges, etc can put teens at higher risk of STDs because those who make such pledges are LESS likely to have condoms when they do have their first sexual intercourse, which eventually happens before marriage.  Furthermore, none of these messages reduce the chance of having an STD later in life as young adults.  Generally Dr. Meeker mixes stories about her patients with a non-critical, non-scientific manipulation of scientific literature to promote an alarmist agenda that is not helpful and probably damaging.  Condoms prevent STD transmission and teens have sex.  Face it and deal with it 
 I had to send the grinder back due to not working properly and not having the bottom cover for the grinder.  I was disappointed because this was for a birthday gift and it was not working and missing a part.  I did not order another one 
 I was hoping for something new and enlightening. instead it is simply a compilation of sayings that are common to Matthew and Luke. Nothing new, nothing enlightening and only 20 minutes of reading. There's nothing "lost" about it either because it already all exists in the Bible and in context. If you want to know Jesus, I recommend you buy a Bible instead 
 this item arrived with a broken tank, and 1 week later quit making mist at al 
 At first I thought the history of women's sexuality in this book was interesting, but once I read that the author recommends fantasies that include incest, I threw the book in the trash.  She states that "fantasies aren't sick; only hurtful behavior is sick."  In my opinion incest as a fantasy is sick no matter how you look at it.  Other than that the book had nothhing new in it, stating that women should not depend on a man for pleasure and they should use vibrators, masturbation and pornography to please themselves during sex.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 Buy Nick Mason's "Inside Out" biographical book instead. Much better - great photos & the real story. This one's a snoozer 
 This phone sucks.  The battery doesn't hold the charge, resulting in dropped calls and major aggravation. GE should be embarrased to offer such a piece of junk. Do not fall for this phone because it is inexpensive, as I did. You'll end up spending a ton of money on new battery packs or having to buy a new phone in just a few months, as i am about to do today. This time I'm going Panasonic! FYI: My GE refridgerator is also a piece of cra 
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 I really didn't want to give a star at all.  It was definitely too militant.  I was introduced to her from the Frida CD and have Border and was somewhat happy with that as there were just a few what I would call militant songs.  By this La Sandunga is by far toooooo much 
 How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding 
 not only would he still have his job,but hed have a lot of ''gangstas'' for fans.further proof that not only are rappers a disgrace,but hypocritical as well.rappers and their low life fans deserve each other.   PEACE,SON...YA HURD  
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 GNR were a very overrated band. I found Appetite For Destruction very dull. This atleast has the band's 3 GREAT songs in November Rain, Civil War, and Live And Let Die. Get this for 3 great songs but stay away from GNRS OTHER CRAPPY SONGS AND ALBUMS!! THEY ARE NOT METAL! 
 Just read the first few chapters and you'll see: Dwight is an indecisive mess. If he were a deep and interesting or richly amusing character, this could have worked far better. But he's  annoyingly drab and dull. A downer if there ever was one. He can't decide what he wants to do and neither can his author. That's exactly how the book itself reads.  And therein is the problem.  We follow Dwight as he makes his confused way--all in his head--to work, to his girlfriend's, to his Social Register Episcopalean parents'. Then the author takes Dwight into the jungles of Central America and it doesn't really get a lot better. In fact, it gets worse, because supposedly, Dwight, through a magical drug--becomes an enlightened freedom-fighter of some kind, But it all comes off flat and implausible.  Okay--there is some humor here--but it's a limp attempt at justifying the flimsy story-line. Forget character development. The one thing we do see is that Dwight has a creepy liking for his sister.  It's up to you: Take a risk of o'd'-ing on your meds (not so unlike our protagonist)  by not taking an extra caplet or two but by picking up this book--believing it will really take you into some worthwhile adventure, or suffer the consequences of some over-time zzz's at morning's alarm.          What irks me is that the hype around this novel made it look like this was the best thing ever written. Now that I look back, the reviews were a bit absurd. I recall one reviewer actually wrote in the voice of Holden Caulfield--saying things like   "this book really knocked me out"....  "nodded me out"..would've been more like it.      Obviously, the publisher pulled all the stops to get this thing off and running with all the correct critics--and it just goes to show you that in the long run, readers really do make or break a book. There's a smugness in the world of publishing these days where the problem is not so much that there is not good fiction to be had, but that the stuff that is being selected is an actual reflection of the individuals doing the chosing!     The best writers write from life experience; are in touch with real life issues, and value the reader foremost. There are far better books out there. I suggest:  ANOTHER BULLS**T NIGHT IN SUCK CITY, SIM0N LAZARUS, A LONG WAY DOWN, A QUESTION OF ATTRACTION to name a few. All truly humorous. All strong reads 
 Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.  I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.  The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.  I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum "best-seller," I'll just stick to the films, thanks 
 I ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions.  I'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools.  Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  I'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.   Some of the parenting tips are common sense that I didn't think needed to be reiterated.  A person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  I was looking for more than that.  The advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process. There is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  An example is always attributing "hovering parents" to ego issues, that a parent "needs to be needed".  Some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  False assumptions leads to false conclusions.   I gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  But it isn't helping my family.  
 you have to read it in Russian. You CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT, and i repeat, CANNOT (!) read it in translation- its like trading feces for gold. That is literally what it sounds like in comparison to the original. The specificity, brutality, the sumptuous tenderness of the Russian language are all but lost in these translations of one of this century's greatest poets. Although you might enjoy what you are reading, given you do not speak Russian- you honestly cannot even BEGIN to touch the greatness of Akhmatova or any other Russian poet by reading it in translation.   I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of translating poetry- to me its barbaric. A poem is so brief, it is so immediate and so dependent upon every word- no one should ever touch it. If you want it bad enough, learn Russian. And just so you know, reading Russian poetry in its original form is MORE than worth going through the trouble of learning the language. There is nothing in the world like it- nothing. It beats Shakespeare. 
 Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 "The Jason Strain" has the same problem that "Hell Lake" (Another Friday the 13th book from Black Flame)had.  The back cover sounds great, but the book falls short.  At least "Hell Lake" did stay with the idea pitched on the back cover.  "The Jason Strain" does not!  The idea sounds like a 'can't miss'-A new reality show puts convicts on a island.  The last one alive gets their death sentence turned to life in prison.  What the convicts don't know, is that Jason is also on the island, and of course Jason could care less about TV shows, rules, cameras....  I was patient with the book well over 100 pages into it.  I was fine with meeting all the characters, even though at this point Jason had just made a few cameos in the book.  I was counting on the story picking up when the convicts get on the island and face Jason.    But the book chooses to take off with another plot that I could have done without.  It's too bad, bacause "Jason on Survivor" could have been cool.  But like other posters have written, this book wants to throw every plot idea in but the kitchen sink.  And I agree, that this story didn't need Jason in it at all.  He is a wasted after thought.  Too bad.  I do enjoy the "Jason X" Books, and the "Nightmare on Elm Street" set as well.  So far though, the "Friday" books have been a mixed bag.  "Church of the divine psychopath" was the best.  "Hell Lake" tried, but was hard to get through-but at leasr Jason IS in that book!!!!  I skipped "Hate Kill Repeat", to read this one first.  Bad idea on my part.  The next book sounds good-Jason's mother is back!  Will this idea be wasted as well?  We'll find out.     
 I bought this apron with a set of knives, and when I opened the shipping box, the apron was sealed in plastic, but I could see that pieces of the logo were missing as if it had been washed 50 times.  Disappointing 
 I burn about 50 CDs a week in live music trades.  I can tell you from experience that these discs do not last.  After a year or so, they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems.  Any scratches that they have only make it worse.  I recommend using Sony, Fuji, or TDK.  All the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don't stand the test of time.  So if you care about preserving your CDs, don't use these ones 
 I found the book annoying.  Why? Because St. James recommends too many times that if you can't "delegate" to someone else Christmas chores associated with upholding certain Christmas traditions, just don't do them.  Lots of contradictions in this book, too.  In the chapter "Remember What You Once Loved About the Holidays," she recalls "The fresh scent of pine when we first brought the Christmas tree into the house."  Later on she devotes an entire chapter to "Twelve Reasons to Skip the Tree."  And then there is the irony of paying money for a book that tells you to cut way back on your Christmas spending. There are a few good tips among the 100 ways St. James offers to "Simplify your Christmas," but they aren't worth the price of this book.  The bottom line is that, for adults, "keeping Christmas" involves a certain amount of money, effort and knowledge about Christmas history and traditions.  St. James seems to want to skip it all

 Fairy tales are written the way that they are written for a reason.  And when greedy producers and actors and directors realize this maybe the world will be a better place.  The characters in Fairy Tales aren't suppose to grow up. They are written for certain age groups and are moral lessons about concequences in life and how she/he's life will change depending on which choices that one will make and direction she/he follows 
 With the exception of sometime employer Paul McCartney, no one escapes Emerick's petty, self-serving tirade.  At times you almost get the impression that Emerick thinks that he and McCartney could have done as well without those other pesky people.  Let's see, George Martin was a scene stealing sop who took credit for all of Geoff's wonderfulness, John was a space cadet, George was a subpar musician and Ringo was unfriendly. (In Ringo's defense, if Emerick is as graceless in person as he is on these pages, I'd avoid him too.)  Emerick had a wonderful opportunity to pen a truely insightful book on a grossly overwritten topic.  Instead he let his ego and vanity dictate what is no more than a transparent tribute to his mentor, friend and meal ticket, Paul McCartney.          Frankly, the Beatles and McCartney deserved better 
 This book offers a comprehensive information package that guides the reader through  pertinent facts that make it clear yet simple to  understand the principles of metal forming and working.The book is packed  with formulas that simplify complicated tooling problems that occur when  melal is formed. This book was written by a  group of acomplished highly  respected Tool & Die Journeymen who pooled their years of experiance of  the trade togeather into one compact, resource, handbook 
 Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time 
 Who knows why Ruelle felt compelled to write this book?  He makes a lot of sweeping statements about fields he doesn't have a mastery over.  Only  tangentially does he bring in chaos, and he doesn't bother staying on any  point long enough to add any insight on any of the issues presented.  It's  such a weak book that it doesn't even have "brainstorming value"  -- the collection of ideas is limited in breadth and depth.  Perhaps in  1991 it was fashionable to come up with books like this; having read it in  1999, I found little of value 
 I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore.  Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so!  Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring.  Was this a mystery?  I don't remember much of a plot at all.  Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts.  Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?  Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable.  For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison 
 Had I wanted 300 pages of Duke propagana, I would have purchased their basketball media guide.  Coach K's self love has never been more evident.     Coach should stick to what he does best: ruining the careers of McDonald's All-Americans 
 Bought this book as a spinoff to a seminar hoping for some insight into a complex subject. The common cause made between ineffectual clergy of the late 18th century and American women was interesting, but then the author lost herself (and her theme) in her exhausting review of obscure, forgettable literature. The phrase "deadly dull" comes to mind.    The book is more notable for what it does not address than for what it does.   
 I had this sent to my little brother and they threw away the packaging before discovering that they recieved a broken unit, and of course they didn't tell me in a timely fashion.  Shoddy merch is not cool, anything we can do to swap it out is fine, but being over 30 days I guess you win

 Overcoming the Fear of Success is hands down, the worst, most destructive book I have ever read.  When I read it at age 16, what it did was convince me that my own unconscious or subconscious mind was "out to get me" and derail me of every attempt I made at success.  So instead of helping me, the book ended up hurting me a great deal. I cannot tell how many times I think about this book in my life (I'm now 40) and the terror it brought me.  The author basically said you could overcome the fear of success only through much work or at least modify your fear. So basically, in some instances, you could never really overcome it.  This is a psychiatrist with a major, delusional mental illness who is trying to help the readers overcome their mental "illness", but instead, what she accomplishes is a FEAR OF THE FEAR OF SUCCESS in her readers and a terror of living within your own skin.  The book is very poorly written (I have read it three times) and I HIGHLY reccommend you do NOT buy this book.  It is awful and full of "hearsay" and incorrect information. Thank you, Martha Friedman, for causing me to spend many years and alot of money on unneeded therapists and continual worry. You have been a discredit to your profession and have caused needless pain and suffering in people instead of help 
 Ok first off the art work is actually pretty damn good if you like comic art from 40z comics by Jim Mahfood, Invader Zim, Johnny homiciadal maniac ect..... But, seriously don't buy this flaming turd.... I checked this out from something called the Library which lets you look at books for free!  Story plot is very very bad.....Take matrix take bill and teds adventure and spice in some akira rip offs and you have this bland book.  The consensus has been slowly taking away our dreams towards making us all mindless slaves in our "awaken" reality.  But, our hero Zeke gets to club zero thanks to some akira clones that brought certain people to the club. He's the key for the akira clones to break on through to the other side ie the present awoken world.  And also they need him to help stop the consensus from making everyone mindless in either realm.  Oi enough of this crap it goes on and on.  Zeke gets those at the club to remember it in awaken world dad isnt dad or is he. Consense can offer him everything if he stops and oh boy big confirtation at the end where it's all up to Zeke to deterimine what's going to happen to reality as we know... What does he do?!?!? Oh guess what one makes their own choices and decisions in life cause Zeke choose's YOU!! Yes YOU!! Thats right!!! What the F crap ending is this?!? Why it's something out of choose your own adventure book or some crappy ass lesson  brought to you by barny the loveable dinasour! The only way you could give this a 5 star rating is if your brain is rotted out on E bomb cause like matirx 2 half of this book waste pages just showing the kids at rave after rave! 
 I was really excited about this book before I opened it.  I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available.  All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space.  Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize.  Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen.  Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace.  Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.  If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate 
 This product would have been the answer to all of my problems if it weren't for a few fatal flaws;  1) It does not support 'multifunction' keyboards...their technical support informed me this includes any keyboards that include volume control, internet buttons, etc.  You know, the kind that come with most modern PCs sold today.  I don't use those buttons and keyboards are cheap - I'd be willing to just buy a new one except:  2) Mice with wheel buttons are not supported (according to their tech support, this also constitutes a 'multifunction' device)...so if you are a gamer (or just like the wheel button), prepare to replace your gaming mouse with a plain vanilla 2-button mouse.  3) Their tech support is pretty awful; They seem to have a checklist of devices that are unsupported (despite being pretty standard with most PCs on the market today), and seem more interested in finding a reason why your configuration is unsupported (thus ending the call) than actually working with you.   My mouse was working on both PCs but was just a little choppy on one, but once the support person latched onto the fact that it had a wheel, they were unwilling to waste another second talking about  what might be causing the problem and if anything at all could be done to fix it.  It's too bad, it's even a slick looking little device.  I give it two stars because it does indeed switch back and forth between the two monitors 
 this is the worse thing that i have ever heard.save your time,and your mone 
 This is not a satire of Candide, it's not a slice of pop culture. It's a dirty old man's idea of what sex should be like. A dirty old virgin man.   It's boring. The writing is atrocious. It has several rapes and incest scenes in it. It has no more than one instance of a woman enjoying sex (and I can't be sure about that one) with sex on nearly every page. It is racist and sexist and boring. If you want 80 variations on what to call a woman's sexual organs, this is the book for you (honey pot, lamb-pit, sugar scoop, ever-sweeting, etc). If you want a book indicitive of the culture of the time, or just plain full of sex, please look elsewhere 
 The author has done a good job of scouring the antenna literature and summarizing all of the equations in one place.  The problem is the lack of any discussion about what the equations mean.  I am reminded of the definition of a college education given by Prof. McWhorter of Stanford, "the process of the professors notes becoming the student's notes without having passed through the mind of either."  If you are an experienced antenna designer, this book will be of help.  If you want to learn from scratch, try the 50 year old book by Kraus 
 This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 Kahney is a hack, sadly, and while Mac fanatics may love a world in which Apple can do no wrong, they will be ill-served by this bomb 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 From beginning to end, I found this book to be dreadful, and an utter waste of my time. Champion? Of what? She is the queen of making excuses, and really, isn't it too soon for an autobiography? Do yourself a favor, skip over this book 
 Not satisfied because there are no  pictures of the birds....was in Puerto Escondido Mexico last season and saw so many birds, so bought this book for the next trip, but no pictures !  My local bird book in New York has all the pictures, which I think is key identifiying the birds....words just are not the same ....the book is so dry without colored pictures compared to other birding books.... 
 I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 While this is an attractive volume, well-printed andwell-bound, and does include a nice selection of Lovecraft's best, Iwould not recommend it.  I really enjoyed Ms. Oates' notes in the front of the front of the book: interesting and well-written, so what's my problem? She provides synopses of the stories, giving away the plot and ending. What fun is it to read a novel, when you've been told the ending in advance 
 The authors brief treatment of what are very complex topics will lead readers to falsely believe that they can trade these markets with little training. It appears that the authors basically cut and pasted brief paragraphs about a variet of topics and called it a book. Other reviewers have called it a 'big picture' book, the truth is it is a complete waste of time and money. 
 The book does a good job in illustrating why the little things we do is important in creating return sales but it does not dive into the world of industrial sales.  The customer of this book is most often the retail consumer.  The world of customer loyalty in industrial relationships is motivated by different needs and not addressed by this book 
 I'm pretty new in the trading world also but I have to go with the crowd and say that this was the absolute worst book ever on day trading. Whatever you do, don't buy this one! Get a toni turner book or something, but NOT this one. Alot has changed since 1999 so it's understood how some techniques can't be used anymore, but this was garbage even back then.   He repeats everything hundreds of times throughout the book, "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread"  "you are the middleman" "you are the middleman"  In a bookstore read the first page of the foreword, it says that he was signed the book deal(1st one) even before he wrote it as a 23 year old. Proof enough that it's hot garbage 
 This book does not provide any information that could not be found in a college level textbook. The assumptions and examples provided in the book are over simplified. If you are anything higher than a junior accountant I would suggest you purchase something else. Calling this book a "Controller's Guide" is just plain wrong 
 How people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me. All the usual suspects are found through out it's pages. This rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for: Polictal correctness, anti-capitalists, anti-gobalisers etc With all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head. What's more the 'ideas' you'll find here have been tried, tested and more importantly failed. Ah well... some people are just too easy to fool 
 I enjoyed Joan's first two books, but this one was a disappointment.  I don't see that Joan Erikson really helped Joan Anderson become her own person.  Instead, Anderson often seemed childlike in her relationship with Erikson, allowing Erikson's voice to be more powerful than her own.  Surely Anderson is mature enough to know whether she wants to cut her hair, and doesn't need Erikson to dictate what she should wear to a business meeting!  Erikson may have had some valuable words of wisdom, but a true mentor honors who you are and encourages you to become your truest self without projecting their own preferences.  
 this book is terrible, and the movie is even worse.  Seems like Jurrassic Park 3 is just a scheme to attract money, and Hollywood decided to throw out a poorly directed, poorly written movie to make money.  Then they decided to make a bunch of crappy mechandise such as this book.  Please... you want a suspensful dinosaur book?  Read the original.  Where it actually has a story line 
 Well, I do like Jason Bittner as a drummer, but the band as such is just annoying. The vocalist is ultra annoying, especially the normal singing bits (as opposed to death style singing). He has the most panziest singing voice and style I have heard in a long time. Its like some school kids trying to sing along with a metal band. Rest of the band is actually pretty tight, but bittner never lets loose like lombardo in Slayer or adler in LOG. He limits himself to simplistic beats and fixed double bass patterns. The songs as such arent all that memorable, really, a band full of musicians are no good when they write songs which need good vocals and have bad vocals. Think they would be much better of with some sort of metal instrumental stuff. Either that or they should take some inspiration from bands like Opeth or Dream theater and add some complexity to their music to keep it interesting. I really had high hopes for this band, and I really wanted to like them especially after seeing bittner play in MDF 2005. But sadly, they dont live up to my expectations 
 This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams.. 
 I'm not sure what I was expecting but this book read like old articles in Mother Earth News. I don't know where the author lives but the suggestion for businesses have been done to death around here for quite a few years so that leaves you with his "wisdom" such as; don't throw money around or keep a low profile to the government or to neighbors if you are operating a business out of your home...whoa...just slightly obvious well worn ideas. I was hoping for new thinking on finding niches in order to make a living, not suggestions that I take a marginal at best, business collecting pine cones or working on cars in my backyard and not blow my cover by buying a mercedes with cash! Duh! Save your money.     
 Diamond Dogs was Bowie's first misstep since becoming famous, but his aura was so powerful that most people hadn't noticed. As far as the media was concerned, the photo of Bowie as a post-apocalyptic half man/half dog mutant provided more than enough fodder for their copy. The album's hit single "Rebel Rebel" helped to disguise the paucity of continuity on this album, but the fact remains that Diamond Dogs catches Bowie at a fairly uncertain moment in his career. Fed up with Ziggy Stardust, but unable to entirely throw that persona off, Bowie dabbles in various modifications of his image with this album. Unfortunately, none are anywhere near as convincing as his previous incarnations. The main reason this happens is simply because the material is lacking. Bowie was certainly an artist who was capable of pushing his image before his material, but he was always imaginative as a songwriter, too, so the material always seemed to come from some rarefied place.  Diamond Dogs is too schizophrenic, so the album suffers. Since Bowie expends a great deal of energy trying to develop a theme that never gels, two straight-ahead rock and roll numbers ("Diamond Dogs" and "Rebel Rebel") have the burden of carrying the entire album. They aren't enough. The "Sweet Thing/ Candidate" medley is the only other musical offering on side one; It takes him minutes, but takes us nowhere. The same goes for side two's "Big Brother" segment. "Rock and Roll with Me" is as close as Bowie has ever come to writing generic material, and "We Are the Dead" is lifeless, which leaves "1984" to carry the entire second half of the album. Even this is greatly disappointing, though, especially since it was drastically edited from the ten-minute centerpiece that it had become in recent live (and televised) performances. Why spend so much time and energy introducing your audience to something if you aren't going to utilize it on your album? It is questions like these that remain unanswered, and it is reasons like this that make Diamond Dogs seem so inconsistent, schizophrenic, and confused.     B	Tom Rya 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 Unfortunately the abundance of use-free filler left me with a sour taste and doubt about the author's credibility.  An example would be the page and a half spent on the importance of having a lot of pencils and paper.  Writers don't generally need to be told this.  By and large I found the inset comments from other comics writers more helpful than the author's content, (though some of it is lifted directly from other books.)  I would not recommend this book 
 I got my first month(a horrible Green Day issue)and then nothing! Uh,what up? Its not that good of a magazine,I just want what I paid for 
 This guy is pathetic and should be ashamed of himself.He was ashamed of his mother,yet thought John's mother could do no wrong.He is a hanger-on,and Im sure all Kennedy family members and true friends are disgusted.Also,did every social interaction revolve around liquor? 
 I recently found this first book of Durant's impressive-looking multivolume history set at my local library and was instantly enraptured at the thought of a comprehensive tour down through the ages of our known history. Unfortunately my expectations were soon dashed as I began to read. Instead of history, I found one man's opinions and a lot of rank speculation. While admittedly much of history is guesswork because, well, we weren't there, this author stretches that license beyond what is reasonable.  "History" as that term is normally defined means a narrative of what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and to whom it happened. In several hundred pages I learned very little to answer these fundamental questions. What I found instead were rather strained conclusions and sometimes quite enormous logical leaps about cultural characteristics and mores of ancient peoples, often based on the scantiest of evidence. For example, the discovery of cereal grains in a non-native environment is interpreted to mean that a people "must" have already developed agriculture. What about the possibility of trade? What about the possibility that, at that time, the cereals in question were, in fact, native to that area? Large numbers of these types of sweeping conclusions, in my opinion, left me with little confidence in the credibility of what I was reading. Another example is the author's unabashedly Darwinistic bent that leads him to place far too much weight on the reliability of the "Peking Man" and similar fossil evidence. Even he uses words like "may" and "possibly" in describing whether these are, in fact, human remains. However, the extreme sketchiness of this and other evidence doesn't deter him from making rather dogmatic statements about presumed developments during the paleolithic period.  Similar to that were the author's repeated interjections of his own opinions about the development of culture, morality, social norms, etc. Again, as a student of history I want to know what happened, not the author's opinion about what happened. Yet when I read statements about how clothing developed as the result of a regressive cultural movement away from the "paradise of primitive nudity," quite frankly I just want to yak up my lunch. The author also seems to seize frequent opportunities to take jabs at the opinions and conclusions of other researchers. It was almost as if I were sitting in on one side of a petty squabble between a couple of petulant children.  In short, the flavor I got of Will Durant's master work in the first several hundred pages left me deeply disappointed. I was very much looking forward to reading the whole set, but now I cannot see the point of wasting any more time on even the first volume. Just because it's big and old, that doesn't mean it's great 
 I approached this book with some hope that it would yield help in understanding the great truths of "Christ in you, the hope of glory", the "new self"; and many of the other profound distinctives of this letter. I was even open, as a stalwart conservative evangelical, to stretch my orthodoxy to make it more generous, but what I got was an effort to make every word of Colossians fit the neo-liberation theology agenda of its authors. Let the book say what it says, not what you had hoped it would say.  
 I've read plenty of Star Wars books; over 100. And I can tell you this is the worst one I have ever read. Like someone else on here said, I only read it because I'm trying to read all the SW books. It is way too descriptive and I am still trying to figure out what was going on. It took me a long time to read this book. About a month. On average I read a SW book in 3-6 days depending on how good it is. I thought I might read it again just so I can understand what I didn't like. The fact that Callista was brought into the EU was really not a good idea. She has no purpose except to run from Luke in every book. I won't even bother with plot because you wouldn't understand. It's hard enough understanding when you read the whole book. A terrible book. It is rarely referred to in the EU. I can only think of one book that actually devoted more than a sentence to it. And Bantam was not thinking when they let Hambly come back with Planet of Twilight. She tried to bring Callista back again and I think someone finally realized that Callista was not going anywhere. She died out eventually without ever making an impression on the SW universe. Except, of course, to leave a bad taste in your mouth. As you can see, I have nothing good to say about this book. Unless you're here to read every SW book, stay away. Far, far away.  
 The Motely Fool has never shied away from congratulating itself, in an entertaining sort of way.  The trouble comes in when the reality fails to live up to the authors' claims.  Their style of rah-rah anyone-can-make-a-million investing appeals to some novice investors for obvious reasons.  But as Malkiel points out in the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, there will always be a few people who have a fortunate run for a few years.  Today, sadly, after the crash of 2000, the Gardners' conclusions in Rule Breakers Rule Makers seem to be more misleading than helpful, especially for someone just starting out.  If investing were only as easy as the Gardners make out then their own "Rule Breaking" portfolio might have continued to work.  They have tried to selectively cite certain of their more recent portfolios to make it appear that they're continuing to "beat the market like a drum", while sweeping under the rug their losing portfolios.  But as the reality of their results stands, they ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping up stocks and making themselves sound like the next Warren Buffett.    There will always be people on Wall Street like the Gardners, inflating expectations and temporarily taking in some newcomers.  In contrast, real investors like Buffett and Graham are modest about their results.  They stick to a realistic expectation of returns, and realize that today's hot stock is often tomorrow's set of crashed dreams.  A beginning investor would be much better served reading Graham's The Intelligent Investor, or another classic of the Street, rather than being drawn into a charming but unrealistic look at the high hopes of what are ultimately mere self-promoters 
 It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot.   Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies.   A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see.   No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy 
 This is quick revisionism from a hired gun. Perhaps the events of the Clinton presidency are too soon for anyone, liberal or conservative, to be objective, but it will never happen if people keep buying books like this 
 I ordered this product and put it in my Nikon D200.  The product was improperly manufactured, and caused the pins in my camera to bend, rendering it inoperable.  I had no idea what the cause was, and went to my camera store, and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well.  We took a quick look at the card, and the holes were obviously improperly aligned.  The damage to the cameras was repairable, and the replacement card I received worked ok, but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment 
 I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with.  I would have returned the book if I could have.  Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce.  The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca.  This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.  For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you.  For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere 
 Being motherless affects so much of who I am; I realized this through Edelman's previous book, "Motherless Daughters". I laughed and cried my way through the pages of that book, so I was intrigued by the publication of "Motherless Mothers".   While very informative in many aspects (she begins to deal with the specifics of mothering from pregnancy all the way through grandparenting and so on...), I found many of her statements to be too broad of a stroke to cover the ever so intimate and personal experience of the loss of one's mother: ultimately, there are too many variables in one's life to truly come up with an effective statistic, so many of the ones presented, also, so bleak.  Much like with "Motherless Daughters", I loved Edelman's personal stories (written with SO MUCH LOVE) as well as those of the women she interviewed in "Motherless Mothers". In a sense, reading this book was like revisiting a friend after several years and finding she had grown up, matured and had healed what seemed to be open wounds last time I read her.  Still, would I recommend this book? Not over her previous one, no. There are many parenting books I have found more effective in helping me understand who I am as a parent (as well as improving my parenting skills, a nice consequence of understanding who you are) 
 Nothing you can't find on the internet for free.  I have noticed that most of the five star reviews below of this book come from people who have _only_ reviewed other books by Debra Fulghum Bruce.  And oddly enough, each of them have been given five stars too.   Shameful 
 This is the first and so far only book on technical analysis I have read.  Though I will read at least a couple more.  This book doesn't appear to be the easy way to get started.  You get some techniques, though never enough to really make full use.  Explanations are started, then ended with the promise to get back to it later.  Not a good way to learn if that is the rule, and in this book it is.  Is Ms Brown just stumping for her web site or what?  But I am not so sure it is all her fault.  Maybe technical analysis of the stock or futures market is the problem.  Everything about it smacks of self delusion.  Going by this one book, and some reading of the subject on the internet, technical analysis is the astrology of the 21st century the way it looks so far.    You get various systems for deciding.  The advice to get three indicators that agree.  Why three?  Why not five, and why not explain which three work?  Ms. Brown gives analysis, and then adds little changes over the standard.  But there is no rhyme or reason as to why this change now, and another at a different time.  Just something to make it fit, and seem to work.  Then the advice to pick a few indicators, oscillators, work with them, learn them.  Seems to me you are simply using them long enough in a earnest manner to build up your own confidence in them.  Ms Brown when talking about combining moving averages, mentions Fibonacci numbers in picking your moving averages.  And then makes the comment you can use which ever lengths of moving averages you prefer.  Whatever you choose and are comfortable with.  Now I am sorry, but if this is really technical and has something behind it, there should be some that work better for some purpose versus others.  If not, I think we are back to self delusional confidence building.    At the very least, even if further study of technical analysis proves fruitful and worthwhile, at least for neophytes, leave this book alone.  It isn't much good for you.  The fact an earlier of Ms Brown's works was chosen to prepare candidates for the professional certification exam for the Market Technicians Association doesn't exactly encourage me in regard to technical analysis.    You do get a taste for TA, and some of the terms, with some explanation of the more common type charts etc.  But it is poorly done.  It does provide some info, which is why I give 2 stars rather than 1 star.   I am pretty sure you can do better.  
 Picking up and opening this book is a clolossal waste of time. Buying it is a colossal waste of money. If I had been able to rate this with a zero instead of one star, I would have. This book is nothing more than an advertisement for a movie. I do not know how anyone could possibly be interested in "artwork" from a computer-generated movie. Sad and pathetic. 
 The Irish culture according to an an Englishman's perspective. Truth? Maybe some of it. Stereotypes? Yes 
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 Okay, first of all, 90% of this book is just a rehash of Morris's better-written Performance Cycling.  See my review of that for more specific criticisms than you're going to get below.  What seems to be happening here is that about every 2 years, some amateur coach looks at a few lab studies and cries "Eureka!  High intensity training is more effective than low intensity training!"  Then they write a book, which quickly goes out of print.  Ross basically wants to you to do a modified Conconi test to figure your Critical Power which he (and no one else) defines as the power you can sustain for somewhere between 50 seconds and two minutes, depending on who you are.  Then he bases his whole philosophy on that rather arbitrary number.  Essentially, you will have to do intervals at some percentage of that power output for 4 days in a row, then take 3 days off.  He seems to think that long endurance training reduces type1 fiber size and that this reduces your endurance.  So in his world, training endurance makes your endurance worse.  I think the actual theory is that the reduction in fiber size allows for more efficient oxygen diffusion, but why get bogged down in all that complexity?  He also still seems to think that lactic acid causes muscle fatigue--an embarrassingly outdated notion.  Of course, there is also no discussion of things like Intensity Factors and Training Stress Scores that have become so important with the advent of power meters.  The idea here is that coaches like Michele Ferrari and every pro endurance athlete on the planet are just wasting their time and that they'd be much better off reducing their total training volume to about 3-4 hours/week.  Of course, neither he nor Morris seem to have ever actually coached a top athlete (for obvious reasons) so there is no real-world basis for this belief.  You should do a search on "Understanding Intervals Stephens" (I'd give you the U R L, but Amazon blanks them out) and read the article that comes up.  While admittedly outdated and perhaps even a bit naive, it's probably a fundamentally correct explanation of why Ross/Morris are wrong.  If you really want to reach your potential, it's not going to be this easy.  You're going to have to study Friel's book, buy a power meter with Cycling Peaks software, and put in a whole lot of time.  I wish it weren't true, but if you're going to succeed in an endurance sport, you're gonna have to, well, work endurance...  
 I'm not all that familiar with Kellerman's work since I try to stay clear of serial character novels. But my wife, a Kellerman fan, bought the book and suggested I read it.  While the pace was mostly okay, two things really bothered me about this book. First is that the author is obsessed with wardrobe. He feels the need to exhaustively describe what many characters wear in each scene down to the last stitch! But the thing that I was most unhappy with is that Kellerman does what I don't recall seeing an author ever do. He walks away from the book. Just ends it with no conclusion! It's as if he decided he wrote the required amount of pages and said, "Well, that's it!" and sent it off to the publisher. Two big no-no's for a writer 
 If you are simply a web designer leave this book alone !!!!!!!!!!!!!! The codes will KILL YOU !!!!!!! 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Lynne Cheney, wife to Darth Cheney, sells the Dream of America as the greatest nation on the planet. How unfortunate that the deram isn't a reality. We aren't the first in education, health care, freedom of the press, income equality, or wealth. No we are number one in  debt, co2 emissions, and prisoners. Alot of this can be lain directly at the feet of her husband and his sock puppet George. But I guess the whole family makes money by selling the lies of American Exceptionalism to the masses, while supporting outsourcing, imperialistic wars, and income redistriution to the richest 1%. A more honest patriotic primer whould have been - don't learn, don't questions, consume, join the army, and die for Halliburton.  
 Let's start off with the technical problems. First, Disc one, track five is not "The Rovin' Cowboy", but actually "Chant of the Wanderer." This really stands out when hearing a 1947 recording tossed in the middle of a bunch of 1935 recordings. Also, "Chant of the Wanderer" is the closing track on disc two, which means you get "Chant of the Wanderer" twice and NO "The Rovin' Cowboy". Ouch!  Secondly, disc four is all screwed up with it's track sequencing. The songs are printed one way, but the disc plays it another. Pretty sloppy stuff from Proper records.   Maybe it's just me, but I also felt the song selection wasn't quite up to the Proper standards. Before I heard this box set I thought I WAS a fan, but now I question that. How much of a fan can I really be, when I'm skipping 25% of the songs. Maybe I'm just a person that needs a "best of" collection. I hope Proper has the Andrews Sisters in their pipeline. But, I also hope they do a better job of quality control!   Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. You could never change the records that quickly. As I recall, the British Beatles albums from 1963 to 1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like letting dust settle before being inundated with another song right away. It basically gives each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time 
 I hate to be the only one to say it. but this movie sucked.  It's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to Tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational.  This movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful.   The main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass.  He manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in Tuva, and in one instance hands an unsuspecting Tuvan a joint.  Not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well.  But its hard to take since Paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed.  But paul isnt the only ass of this documentary.  He also has help from his Friends of Tuva and the filmers.  if there is any value in watchings this piece of @#*# its in what not to do when you visit other countries.  Seriously, one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there.  From that character's earlier appearences in the film, i would have to say that he  would have deserved it.  The only thing going for this movie is photage of acual Tuvan's singing.  Im so sorry they had to meet this guy.  If you do decide to get this don't forget to watch the interview with the directors.  Thats definately the best part.  Ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before, but this two are like charactures of them.  if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing The Journey Of Man 
 Ehrenreich is the kind of journalist I despise. One who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn't matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point. She constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn.  The market is to tight, that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one's pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments.  Does that stop Ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments?  Of course not.  She has to do her research, and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity.  If jobs and apartments are so hard to come by, then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them.  There is nothing one learns from Ehrenreich's experiences that one couldn't have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers.  But that would have taken away Ehrenreich's righteous indignation.   Don't encourage this kind of writing.  See it for what it is. Gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience.  And that while doing it, some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions 
 the first few pages of the book is a biographical brief that had been written by a Carmelite nun some time ago. Had this been expanded into a full biography this book would garnish a few more stars. But, instead, the bulk of the book is made up entirely of translations of some of his heaviest epistles steeped in difficult to understand theology.  None of these speaks of where he stood on the issues of his day. The book paints Luciani out to be a man who spent his life on his knees and ignored the issues of his day. Whereas, if one reads Lucien Gregoire's biography of this Pope - Murder in the Vatican - nothing could be further from the truth; as he had spent his life pulling others up off their knees caring for the immense orphan population of his time - monks building and maintaining orphanages and nuns as teachers and as nurses caring for those too ill to come to school. Yet, hats off to the Carmelite nun who thought enough of this great man to have published the first translations of his life into english 
 I love this book although I think The Stinky Cheese Man is a way better book. Beautiful, fun illustrations and a fun read 
 The World According to Waskow should be the title of the totally nonsensical, wretched collection of claptrap. Arthur "East River" Waskow should hold the title of "rabbit" and not "rabbi" because all he has done here is taken his personal political and pseudo-social agenda and coated it with a think shellac of Judaism. I took this book out of the library. I returned it. You should do the same 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 The first part of this 1997 edition covers material that is an "old hat". The rest of the topics are unnecessary, badly explained, too superficial, or unfocused. Don't waste your money, and your time 
 Bells Are Ringing had everything going for it. A good lead actress, repmise, plot, screenplay, and well-written lyrics. But the way that these were used where some of the worst ways you'd ever imagine. The 2001 revival recording of this is 100 times better, and Faith prince does so much better then Judy Holliday. This CD has some things that still work, like the screenplay and lyrics, but as a recording, this is just plain dull 
 I am one third through and I am afraid I find the book poorly organized. There are no real step by step examples integrated with data. I have used other step by step books with greater success 
 pyramid scheme n. A fraudulent money-making scheme in which people are recruited to make payments to others above them in a hierarchy while expecting to receive payments from people recruited below them. Eventually the number of new recruits fails to sustain the payment structure, and the scheme collapses with most people losing the money they paid in.  At Charna's school it's pay to play.  Pay to take classes because only people who go through their one year course can play on their stages-then pay coaches if you make a team.  Everybody there makes money off of the show except the players and students at ImprovOlympic.  This is where Truth in Comedy comes in!  If you like constant name dropping you'll love this book!  If you love being bullied in print this text will dazzle you!  If you love being baited into a legit profession yet not take any pay for it (art for art's sake I beleive it's called.  Shhh.  Don't tell Art!) then this tome will tantalize you!  If you're looking to be suckered by one book this year make it Charna Halpern's TRUTH IN COMEDY!  Available in most bookstores 
 I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published! 
 It is not that bad, it even has a couple of fine and unexpected twists in the plot. It would deserve three stars, but there are way too many nauseating sex scenes.  
 I bought these for my 6 yr old son last fall.  A couple of them have already ripped in half and the others aren't far behind.  Invest a little more and buy something that will last more than a couple of months - the vinyl doesn't 
 The Third edition has been out since 2004 so there isn't any need to still purchase the second edition unless you can get it cheaper 
 "The Zahir" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped.  It, in no way, mentally stimulated me.  I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved "The Alchemist." 
 You like repetitition, repetition, repetition: you'll love this. The musicians let fly oh so rarely. This one got hyped. I fell for it. Shame on me 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 It'll do if you just need to read something.  Kay Scarpetta has just about played out with me.  I'd like to read a book by Ms. Cornwell entitled "The Bloody Murder of Lucy" with this happening in the first paragraph.  This character elimination would delight me and I'd certainly buy that book 
 I got this book at the library (interloan) and I have to say this is dead last in financial self help books.  If you have the time and inclination, by all means go ahead and read it...but I would recommend many books before this; Millionaire Next Door, Richest Man in Babylon,  Think & Grow Rich, How to Win Friends and Influence People, anything by William Nickerson or John T. Reed...or Stephen King for that matter.  Honestly, after reading 50+ books on financial freedom, this book has the dubious distinction of a singular 'a-ha' moment; I realized that if this guy can write a book like this - anyone can.  In short, don't bother...the 3 hours it takes from your life would be better off with your kids, your pets, or your dentist (come on - you know you need it).  Alternatively, buy it yourself.  If for no other reason that encouraging the author in you (but please don't take my word for it) 
 Leveen's book is much like the products he is famous for: slight, expensive, and possibly overblown.  Which isn't to say there aren't kernels of knowledge one can derive from the book.  Unlike many Levenger products, the book is about achieving a deeper relationship with reading and not about looking good while doing it.  To achieve a well-read life, Leveen suggests that you 1) make a list of books you want to read and keep them in categories (Leveen is fairly insistent that you buy the books you want to read - he obviously hasn't considered how expensive that might be); 2) practice the SQ3R method (survey, question, read, recite, review) and preferably write in your books; consider audio books as an addition to, but not replacement of, "reading"; join a reading group.  And that's the book in a nutshell.  There are no a-ha moments unless you're one of those people who doesn't believe in audiobooks, and shame on you if you are.  There is little here that anyone who has ever asked him or herself the question "how can I read more?" hasn't already considered.  In fact, the book made me a little uneasy for two reasons.  First, Leveen's overwhelming need to "possess" books he has or might want to read.  There is little discussion of public libraries and the value they provide to those who cannot afford personal libraries.  Second, Leveen's insistence that writing in one's books is important.  Yes, such an activity can improve one's understanding of the book, but frequently one can't write in a book (library) or would prefer not to (expensive/valuable, such as a first edition).  Writing marginalia is often not nearly as effective as taking real notes 
 This album is a failed attempt to get in the hipster dumbass club. 20 tracks of pretenious self involved crap.  There actually are a couple decent songs, but it also might be good if it was their 4th or 5th album, you when bands go to the desert to find themselves.  They just re invented themselves after being a band for about one year, when they should have stayed true to their roots. If you want to hear a good Willowz record, buy the first one "Willowz s/t".   Vortex 2.0  
 This book tries hard to be academic and the author cannot disguise the fact that this is pure showing off.  The narrative never seems to flow.    If you want a good intellegent read then try Amin Maalouf.  This guy can write! 
 This item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised for 5-8 year olds.  You cannot return the item once opened, so do not order 
 I know that this CD set is great, that is why I ordered it. I however got an e-mail after I had already ordered the item that I found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the "quality of the item wasn't good." What sort of bad advertising is that? It isn't my fault that they priced it wrong, and if there was a mistake I should have received it anyway. It isn't fair, and I want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website. 
 i did not care for this book whatso ever ...waste of my time waste of my money..it didnt tell me nothing..mr.bob spilled no secrets not that he knew any to start with i am sure..i threw the book away..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 Edge City is obnoxious partially because it is full of lies, distortions, and contradictions, and partially because it espouses an irresponsible model of growth and settlement. I say "irresponsble" because while Garreau claims to be merely descriptive, he's actually prescriptive: he not only argues that ECs are inevitable, but insists that they're vital and wonderful and soup for the human soul. I admit, however, that what what initially raised and finally sustained my rancor is that it's another case of someone simply ignoring the research that has come before them, research of which they are clearly aware, and not bothering to show how their new theory sits with respect to that previous knowledge, or why their new explanations are superior to previous ones.  Garreau makes at least 4 references to Jane Jacobs and her seminal Life and Death of Great American Cities early on in his book - mostly throwaway references, one slightly critical. There's absolutely no engagement, though her work is highly relevant. In LDGAM, Jacobs argues that the basic tenents of urban zoning and planning, which she labels "City Beautiful", are flawed, and destined to create dead grey areas in cities. She advocates mixed zoning, so that the same neighborhood contains at least retail, offices, and residential units, and so that there's significant cross-use and foot traffic throughout the day and night. She also advocates measures in general that are calculated to make movement easier and more appealing for pedestrians, such as shorter blocks, and irregular streets mixed in with the main arterial thoroughfares. Her book is much richer than all of this; this is just a summary of the most relevant parts.  Garreau's Edge City opens up by lamenting the deadness of downtowns and their lack of cross-use, their tendency for single-zoning, etc. He goes on to suggest that his "Edge Cities" (suburbs that have rapidly sprung up over the past 30 years, and which contain a mix of commercial, retail, and residential areas) are not only a good solution to the "problems of cities", but in fact, the inevitable one as well. This would be fine if he talked explicity about why mixed-use zoning in cities doesn't work; why being able to walk across the street to buy milk, take a 20 minute bus to work, walk 10 minutes to a park, and be in the midst of thousands of easily accessible city amenities is so much worse than living in a suburb where you need a car to get anywhere, where you have a 20-minute drive to shopping of any kind, and a 45-minute drive to work. But he doesn't. He makes hand-wavey remarks that humans seek out open spaces and freedom, that a man over 30 who takes the bus every day is a failure, that man seeks to be close to nature, and that urban planners are effete intellectuals who have no idea how real people live. Etc. Again, any one of those propositions would be fine, but there's no data to back it up. The book as a whole is little more than a complicated mess of contradictory claims.  For example, in one chapter, Garreau describes Edge Cities as affordable, but in another he admits that as Edge Cities age, they become increasingly expensive, and "middle-income" people are reduced to paying through the nose to live in what Garreau himself describes as the suburban equivalent of tenement houses. When praising the loveliness and freedom of Edge Cities, Garreau more or less only concentrates on the richest citizens - his interviewees were business owners, vice-presidents, and lawyers, all pulling down upper-middle class salaries at the very least. One upscale couple remarks, "It's really our money that makes us free." (How droll!) Indeed, Edge Cities are great if you're a CEO or can afford a giant house on a 3-acre lot, and at least one car per driver to meet basic transit needs. (And social services are a lot better when you're in a neighborhood where everyone makes several hundred thousand a year: at last, you don't have to subsidize local poor people!) At least, Edge Cities are great while they're new. Garreau describes in several places old suburbs that crumbled and died after they got a little less shiny and new, and their corporate sponsors decided to pick up and build a different plot of virgin land.   In sum, the Edge City phenomenon Garreau describes and joyfully embraces as inevitable is no more and no less than a greedy, unsustainable land grab that will force us to build a lot of unecessary infrastructure (roads, sewers) to places that will just be abandoned in another 50 years. 
 In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.  However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway 
 I bought this box set thinking it'd be as great as the first two and I was extremely disappointed... I would have preferred that Rhino just continued with the time period and genre that made up Nuggets 2... I've since sold Children of Nuggets on ebay just to get some of my money back... Don't even bother... Stay with Nuggets 2.. 
 I am an engineering student and currently in differential equations.  I bought this solutions manual to accompany the text book (which I also strongly don't recommend) and wish I had returned it to the bookstore in time.  Unforntuately, I am stuck with it now.  This solutions manual does not explain anything thoroughly.  Any questions with problems that I have, or anyone else in my class for that matter, are almost always skipped over as if the answer to the question is blatantly obvious.  You'll probably have much better luck researching the answers to your questions on the internet or just asking your professor to explain it, because this solutions manual is next to no help at all 
 This is disgusting trash.  You people have really lost all moral decency.  The person you wrote this should be locked up - forever.  
 I'm appalled that my public university, the University of Virginia, would even consider paying somone like him to teach. Everything he talks about is just ridiculous.  
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 This was a very very painful book to read. The author when at the height of her career was a brilliant logician, and all aspiring medievalists from far and wide marvelled at her investigations into William of Ockham's thought. But now, alas, those days are over and the author has overextended her talent by attempting to take on the problem of evil (something she has engaged in before, if only qua editor) but this time by using obsolete, archaic theories of anthropology. Where did her degree in anthropology come from? There is no degree. Where are the references to contemporary anthropology? Not in this book -- in fact it seems like the author didn't bother to even read anyone whose written later than 1980! Good grief! What kind of book is this? Many of her colleagues and former students probably have tremendous sympathy over her loss of faith in analytic philosophy and all its false promises to truth and certainty. But just as many are probably chuckling at this ham-handed attempt to start anew, as if one could invent a discipline of anthrology ex nihilo. This book, as the Magistra would say if she knew any better, " is totally underwhelming." 
 Skip ANY and EVERYTHING written by this jive hummer.  He is a sham and veteran disinformation agent... I have been investigating, writing and editing JFK assassination (and so forth) material since the early 70s, and this comes from personal experience 
 We all have bad days, but what was Robin Cook thinking in allowing this book to be published?  It is full of errors, and the plot just doesn't come together.  The ending is not plausible. If you decide to read it, check it out from the library, don't spend your money!  Sorry,  Mr. Cook, it's not up to your usual standards 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 If you want a good history of this era, this is not it - unless you are an economist. Only then could you want all of the transactions that occurred in the history of French economics and that is what this book gives you. Everything is told in terms of taxes, fees, and more taxes. I am currently reading "The Course of French History," by Pierre Goubert. It is much more enlightening 
 It would be impossible for me to write you a review.  I never received the subject CD.  You sent me some piece of crap dics which I sent back.  I have not received the Gene Watson CD i ordered and paid for.  If I don't get it soon, you will never hear from me again.  Edward N Clark - Herrin, I 
 Returning this antenana because the performance was actually worse than the tiny standard Apple G5 antenna with its theoretically less advantaged placement under a desk.  Mac Stumbler rates the signal strength around 45-51 with the standard T shaped antenna.  Even raising the DWL-M60AT to head height the signal strength never rose over 43%.  Maybe the omini-directional standard antenna is better at dealing with the obstructions and DWL-M60AT would perform given clear line of sight.  Perhaps the larger Dr Bott directional antenna is worth the 5x premium 
 This book is the very definition of over rated..how on earth do you have a book like this and no images of these supposed fantastic apartments, I suggest a book on the architects of this building, Rosario Candela and James Carpenter, now that will show you the famous Rockefeller apartment, and fyi, it's a fantastic book, this book on the other hand is inane dribble...what a bore 
 Don't waste your money.  Buy the 8 in pan.  It's a real All-Clad.  As I read these reviews, I keep seeing people rave about how good All-Clad is, not really how an individual pan actually performers.  Yes, I have All-Clad.  Lots of All-Clad.  When the company brings out a new pan, I buy it.  In the small pans that I use the most, I am likely to have 2 of each.  But, I don't recommend the 7-? inch.  All-Clad likes to bring out pans that are almost a `try me'; as was the case with the 7 ? inch and 1 qt pan a few years ago.  They priced them attractively.  To me the pan is handle heavy.  It does not sit properly on my electric stove.  Thus it has poor heat conductivity.  For a few dollars more, buy the 8 inch fry pan.  The 8 inch is US made, and the 7 ? inch is imported.  
 Fortunately I had the "Windows XP Annoyances" manual to thoroughly explain how to use Windows XP's Chkdsk utility. "Chkdsk", or any spelling of it, does not appear in "The Missing Manual" or index as far as I know, but it does in "Windows XP Annoyances". Something as basic and important as "Chkdsk" should not be missing. I wonder how many other entries are non-existent? Having read both manuals, I prefer "Windows XP Annoyances". Pogue's content reads like a rehashed Microsoft Windows XP "Help" tutorial. There's more substance in the other manual 
 The single "Somewhere out there" on this album is NOT the version Fievel sings in An American Tail. This one is about some purple haired girl who tastes good, probably like grape 
 I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.  I got a facile tale of the Southwest.  Buyers beware!  This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing 
  When you subscribe to the Wall Street Journal it's like getting two newspapers:  a good news reporting paper and an what at times seems like an editorial page written by sophmomores in the local Young Americans for Freedom college rag.  It's not that I mind right-wing editorials, I'm somewhat of a libertarian myself, it's just that its editorial page puts ideology ahead of reason far too often for my taste.  For a much better deal  -- business news, all the financial quotes, much better international coverage, and excellent and concise reporting -- choose the Financial Times.  At the moment an annual subscription is selling for $50.  It's a much better publication and on Saturday's has a very fine weekend section with good book reviews and arts and culture coverage.  Also because the FT is based out of London the editors are much more balanced and less cowed or ideologically obedient.  Even if they were similarly priced the FT would be the better deal.  As it is the FT costs a fraction of the price of the WSJ.  
 I have to state from the start the only book I ever liked by V.C. Andrews was "Flowers in the Attic."  The dialogue was simplistic but at least the story was interesting.  I read the next in the series and it was terrible.  I read the third in the series and gave up midway.  Someone gave me Broken Flower and having nothing else to read I am attempting to read it but I won't last long.  To a degree the characters are the same as in Flowers.  Last night I read Ian who molested his sister is going to be a doctor.  How many times can this story be rehashed?      The mother's grief over precocious puberty is so over the wall it is pathological, especially in this day and time when it is common.  I had a child with precocious puberty and that was 15 years ago.    Usually I am happy that people read no matter what they read but I hate these characters.  I hate these storylines.  I feel badly that people don't read books of better quality.  
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 I have been a big fan of this most fun of all kung fu flicks for more than twenty years, from originally seeing it in the theater to having the VHS version to the DVD.  It's got everything a great kitschy martial arts film should have.  High kicking, fast moving action coupled with colorful costumes and scenery lends all of the excitement any movie needs.  But of course, the masks are what sets this movie apart, and gives it its most distinctive flavor- even though, aside from the Scorpion, no other character wears his mask for more than the first few minutes of the film.   The HUGE downside to this DVD is, as others have pointed out, the quality of the print.  It is simply terrible.  Grainy and scratched, with multiple blips and splices, it is annoying to watch on a medium like DVD which is normally so pristine.  I took a previous reviewer's advice and found the DVD on the Celestial release- and I couldn't beleive it.  The difference is night and day.  The Celestial release has been remastered and restored to the glory that DVD can bring- I was so used to watching the grainy release that seeing it like this brought details to my eyes I had forgotten.  I bought mine from [...] (Hong Kong Flicks), and it was worth every penny- it includes extras like movie stills, the original movie poster, and a behind the scenes feature.  This is the DVD to get, not this sub-par print 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 When it's sweltering here in our Palm Springs desert paradise, clothing optional settings and activities are a natural for many locals and visitors.  So if it's summer and you live here, odds are that you're already naked as you read this.  In the soothing NUDE YOGA & TAI CHI ($20), five buck-naked youngish women go through relatively easy yoga and tai chi routines. To someone who is an amateur of both disciplines, the yoga seemed superior to the tai chi.    When this title was first released on home video, it was  criticized by some hard core feminists as merely another excuse to exploit naked women with large, augmented, breasts and that it's nothing more than soft core titillation.    Maybe and maybe not.      Since sexual energy is an element of yoga (remember Madonna's suggestive yoga poses in W magazine?), if this digital routine arouses, perhaps that's just an added bonus.  The low key elevator music and the almost hypnotic, non-intrusive narration make this a nice morning or evening routine to either get the blood flowing or to wind down.  Not Rated: Full frontal nudity (sometimes with socks).  Genre: Exercise.  95 Minutes.   
 What a disappointment.  I cared nothing about the charecters, and the plot never showed up. If you want to read about the government, pick up Clancy 
 The International Jew is a compilation of articles that Henry Ford wrote over his lifetime. I have found it to be extremely offensive, anti-Jewish, and racist. It is a book that retains no educational value and demonstrates hatred. As a Muslim I find that these types of books are not useful and instead detrimental to the human mind. 
 This film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama.   I will not give away the plot -- although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it. Basically Clooney's character Mr. Ocean, a career burgler, is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a Las Vegas casino. So he recruits 11 men, each with a talent to add to the operation. This is where the trouble begins. The viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters. There is almost no introduction to many of them, and barely even a mention of their names. Literally half an hour into the film "the eleven" are assembled and they're already robbing the casino. How's that for plot development? And that's basically it ladies and gentlemen: go to Vegas, rob casino, go home, movie over. Some of the "good guys" are even outright repellant. Our would-be heros' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy Hollywood tycoon. Am I supposed to like this fat weasel?   The only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least Mr. Ocean, is that the guy he's robbing, the casion owner, is a really bad guy. Supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff. (This actor played a bad guy in Godfather Part 3). But we never see any real evil deeds. In fact, he just seems like a handsome, polite, very prosperous businessman. He manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film. Mr. Ocean on the other hand, and his cohorts, are career criminals. But the guy they're robbing is an even greater criminal, you see. So that makes it OK. And really, if you were being robbed, wouldn't you want to be robbed by George Clooney and Brad Pitt? They're such nice guys. That makes getting robbed fun. Just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy. How thrilling.  This entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with Julia Roberts. There are a few minor things going on in the backgroung, like a boxing match, which are essentially irrelevent. Throughout there seems to be vital information missing (like say, a plot). Soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to Clooney and Roberts.   This film is also horribly cut. Several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced, and then completely forgotten about. Take the scene where Pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino's owner makes an appearence. The folder he has just been handed, explains Pitt, contains secret security codes. You would think that would be something important right? You would think they will need to get those codes. Well, wrong. In fact you won't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie. They introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development. And that happens all the time in this movie.   In fact Mr. Ocean's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties. (And boy, they started repelling down that shaft quick, didn't they? You didn't even know they were robbing the place yet. Wow, these guys are good. Or maybe Steven Soderbergh is as over-rated as his film.) They make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven. This, after Mr. Ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have.   One would hope this film would at least end strong. But Soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed. We are left wondering whether the "eleven" actually got away with their caper...or worse. What a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted. The writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the DVD! (As did the actors in their commentary.)Probably the best moment on this DVD is hearing the screenwriter tell Soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending.   I am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars, since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad, but this film comes very close to 1 star. This is your standard artistically worthless Hollywood product. It is big on budget, big on bling, and low on story. I suppose if you just feel like wasting some time, this is as good a way to do it as any. Personally I would rather have a story with more substance 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 I found this book in my local library while searching for information on the activities of the modern United States Marine Corps.  While it goes pretty far in meeting this interest, its got some really annoying baggage.  The basic premise of Mr. Warren's story seems to be the United States Marine Corps is the only organization capable of defending the interests of the nation.  The other services are failed organizations lacking in the martial skill, charisma and intelligence to do much more than thwart Marines in their activities and to occasionally produce a leader who will praise their greatness. To apparently reinforce this, the author almost always uses lower case terminology when referring to members of the supposedly inferior branches.  I really don't see the point of all this.  The Marines have an illustrious history which does not need the belittling of other services to help it along.  If Mr. Warren could have proved his premise, I would not be so harsh.  But the man just does not seem to have much of a clue when it comes to the background of the "lesser" services and their histories.  This can best be seen in his take on activities in Somalia in the early 1990s.  From the author's vantage, the Marines pretty much had Somalia stabilized when the Army took over and screwed up everything by not using Marine techniques.  This is a massive oversimplification given that the Marine and Army missions in Somalia were so different comparisons just do not make sense.  Perhaps if he delved into a little Army specific research he might have realized this.  Sadly, it appears the author just relied on official Marine sources such as one would get from Public Affairs Officers.  How does one otherwise explain the author's bizarre comment that Marines pioneered the use if helicopters in warfare (yeah, Marines were first to actually use them but most of the innovations came from the Army during the Vietnam War).  The only part I liked was Warren's recounting of recent Marine combat activities.  While a bit dry at times, he does managage to pull together the big picture and a foxhole view pretty well.  But even then, youve got to put up with lots of propaganda 
 i will certainly not recommend you this cheesy,awful new wave pop bands collection of what seems to be their worst hits.such awful cd's should come packaged with a health warning and if anything this cd should be banned.fda take note.not recommended even to an enemy.minus fifty stars 
 This will end up being the worst tech book I have every read. The book starts off with lofty goals and ends up achieving none. None of the topics are presented properly. As pointed out in various reviews, chapter 4 is where the nightmare begins. That is not to say that the first three chapters are good, because there's really nothing worth reading in those first few pages.  The authors do NOT do justice to VoIP, to security, and to VoIP security.  Don't waste your money on this book

 I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.  It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.  The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:  First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.  Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:  The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .  The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.  It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.  I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door 
 I ordered these for my Mom who has several different items of the Corelle Coordinates.  When they arrived, the color was no where close to the ones in the picture.  The picture appears to be a bright, almost fire engine red color.  In reality, it is a dull purplish-red color.  My sister also bought the same set for our mother and again the cajun red was the same purplish-red and not the bright red in the picture.  I can say that both sets did arrive undamaged and seemed to be packed well.  The bakeware itself if very nice to use however, I'm rating it one star since the color wasn't even close to what I expected 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I've been a fan of Bruce Campbell for a long time, ever since seeing Army of Darkness and Brisco County Jr. actually. In the early nineties Bruce Campbell burst on to the scene with an original and fresh personae that was side-clutching, rolling on the floor hilarious at times. I remember being devastated when they stopped producing Brisco County, and then so excited when they announced Jack of All Trades. I didn't get to see the Jack series though as it wasn't carried in my area. I decided to rectify that last month and order the series as a kind of an early Christmas present to myself. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I am not sure whether I would have found this series funny or entertaining a dozen years ago when it was released, but after watching the first two episodes I just didn't care to watch any more of them. I felt that the half hour format didn't permit any real character development or permit them to write any really interesting plots to build on the Wild, Wild West promise of the show. Or maybe it is just that I am older and my tastes have changed. But, for whatever reason, the show did not grab me at all and I don't see myself wasting any more time watching additional episodes. I love watching Bruce Campbell, but the magic of Brisco County, Jr. just didn't seem to be present in this series. If you are a real Bruce Campbell fan though you might go ahead and give this a try. Just because it fell flat for me doesn't mean it will for you. I think Bruce Campbell is a one-of-a-kind and maybe I just hit this on a bad day. Long live Bruce 
 Unfortunately I wasnt a kid when this film first came out ,So have no nostalgic feeling for it.  I came out of the comics back when Neal Adams brought back the darker,brooding Batman from what he had become after the TV show made him more of a silly "camp" cartoon clown. I mean ,I like Adam West...in a sort of William Shatner kind of way, but the show was always about the punchline.   so when the Batman movies did come along, I was waiting for more of a Neal Adams, acrobatic and vengeful Batman ...but was pretty dissappointed when they returned with a perhaps darker , but more drawing on the TV show Batman once again. So I only saw Batman and Batman Returns once, when they initially came out.  anyway, Last night "Returns" was on TV and I decided I better give it another chance to see what all the hoopla was about. ...and I still can't see it.  Yes Michelle is very Hot in her costume and her story was a bit more complex than I remembered, in fact the movie seems to revolve around her... which I guess is a positive, but it just wasnt enough to keep it from being the campy Burton film it is.  I'm just not getting where the "Dark,Moody and brooding" stuff is coming from. The whole night time lighting of the rooftop scenes actually reminds me more of The Chimney sweep dancing scene in Mary Poppins .Dont get me wrong, I thought Mary Poppins was very well done, But for the Creature of the night Batman is supposed to be...ok maybe hes not supposed to be, but I thought he was supposed to be...  this was just a bit to crisp,clear and bright. the camera work in the fight scenes and the fights themselves,  I wanted to be more amazing aswell. not this posing,punching, hold the camera still for the running backflips then back into stiff fighting poses.  Batman should be almost faster than you can see in his movements, So should Catwoman, Not out there posing! the Penguin? geez, yeah, he's pretty grotesque.he's got penguins with rocket backpacks running around and a lot of people get killed in the movie, but I'm just dont get sucked into this movie. Its just too campy for me.   But if you want you Batman that way, then hey this is a pretty good film,I guess. But I much prefer the more recent Batman Begins. for me, That one finally got it right 
 Is it generally a rule that miniseries based off books have to suck so badly?  I've seen a million TV miniseries based off novels that have sucked so horrendously, but NONE like this.  Get this straight before I continue: I LOVE the book version of The Tommyknockers; it's my alltime favorite Stephen King novel (second-favorite: The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon... review to come later) and I liked how it took the time to reveal key things about the plot: how Haven got started (and the "sowing and reaping" the itinerant preacher got on with the virgins in the cornfield), how Gard and Bobbi originally got to be such good friends (more than that actually; they dated for some time), and what actually went on in the woods that unleashed the evil.  Here... bulls**t.  Utter bulls**t.  Here is why I think the movie sucked:  - The series is only 2 hours long... what the f**k?  A novel the size of The Tommyknockers can't possibly be fit into a 2-hour long series.  What about the minor stuff that, although minor, can't be taken out without a serious loss in credibility?  Like Hilly.  There wasn't much of him or his disappearing act with his little brother David, and there certainly wasn't enough of his tenure at Altair-4 or their frantic search for his body.  And what about Gard and how he opened up the hole to suck in his conniving ex-poker buddy after getting cheated on a poker game?  That scene would have been amazing in the movie.  But no.  None of it.  -The changes the authors made in the plotline.  Seriously. Get some things at least partially right, then change what you have to in order to fulfill whatever sick and twisted purpose you had in mind when changing the original.  But they take it too far.  Example: in the novel, Gard and Bobbi's teeth originally fell out because of their "becoming"; now, nothing.  And, the aliens themselves have a full set of teeth (that part in the novel)... so why the (insert obscenity here) did they change it?!?!  The only reason I gave this particular hellfest two stars is cause the original was made by Stephen King.  No other reason.  If you are looking for a good time, buy the damn book.  It's the real thing- unlike this piece of s**t.  Overall: 2 stars  Why: for failure to be entertainin 
 This kitchen timer is really cute and I HAD to have it to match every other pink kitchenaid appliance that I own and love. BUT you simply cannot hear it. When the other review said that you couldn't hear it from the other room they were being generous. You literally can't hear it from like 3 feet away unless you REALLY concentrate. So buy it if you just think it's cute - it is. But still you will have to buy a TIMER for your kitchen or you're gonna burn the cookies. 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 This book is a major disappointment from beginning to end. It starts out promisingly enough with a vampire convocation to be held under Jean Claude's auspices and a mysterious vampire ballet production company scheduled to appear. That's where it ends. From there it descends into a series of fairly poorly written sex scenes as Anita, presumably controlled by the "ardeur" hops from bed to bed, as well as floor couch and any other object that happens to be handy. There are some teasers along the way - a Master Vampire and his mermaid wife make a start at some sort of power play, the human and were servants of another Master Vampire enter and exit, etc. - but nothing ever comes of any of them. In the final chapter there is a power play by the vampire leader of the   ballet company but it is all squashed into one short final chapter and pretty well left hanging.  I did not buy this book - for which I am grateful. Even at paperback prices, it is not worth the money. If you must read it, see if the library has a copy 
 It is true that when children read a story they find much more than just a plot with a happy ending.  Many fairy tales including "The Princess and the Pea" contain somewhat hidden patriarchal, social, and class ideologies hidden within the texts.  In the story "The Princess and the Pea" the princess is portrayed as an unintelligent woman who cannot find shelter for herself when she is caught outside in a torrential storm.  The king must invite the princess in and give her shelter.  When the queen sees the princess, soaking wet and dirty from the rain, she does not believe that she could be a "real princess."  Does this mean that just because she is dirty and a little ugly she is not really a beautiful princess on the inside?  What is this teaching children?  Maybe children who read this story will not trust unattractive children.  This could have harsh consequences in a society where racism and other cultural biases are already present.  The fact that the queen truly believes that only a real princess will be able to be sensitive enough to feel the peas suggests that middle and lower class girls cannot be as sensitive as upper and high class girls.  There is also a reference in the story of the prince "taking the princess and making her his wife."  This suggests that the princess has no say in the marriage.  She may not even really love this man, and although she sleeps badly for one night because there are a couple of tiny peas in her bed she may sleep badly for a lifetime after being forced to marry a man that she does not love 
 Through the book I felt that the author was not able to grab me with the emotional intensity that he was going for.  I never could quite buy into the whole "The Big Pharma's Are All Bad."  I did really like the end of the book.  I felt a real connection and love between him and his wife, even though she had passed away.  The author also let's us know what is going to happen:  he will be killed also.  Then he lets the protagonist Jason discover it for himself.  When he is closest to his wife, at the place she was killed, and closest to her cause.  Le Carre points an accusing finger at the US in his book and end notes, but provides little detail to support his accusations.  In fact, BIg Pharma is multinational.  Some of the largest like Bayer are German.  These are the companies that helped gas the Jews.  Looking for an atrocity?  Why not let us write about documented proven suffering without writing books about fictional conspiracy theories, which by his own admission at the end of the book do not exist.  I feel he has an axe to grind with these people.  My Opinion:  Big Pharma gets a bad rap.  I think I owe my life to a monoclonal antibody called rituxan:    Rituxan® (Rituximab) is a unique therapy that works by selectively depleting CD20+ B-cells. B-cells, and their role in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Rheumatoid Arthritis, have been an area of intensive research by scientists around the world, and at Genentech and Biogen Idec. Rituxan affects your immune system by selectively targeting CD20+ B-cells shown to play an important role in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis.  Side effects?  Oh it had side effects all right.  It cured my knee problems (which I assume to be arthritis) at the same time it cured my cancer.  The old treatment?  Well CHOP Chemotherapy which I also got killed my memory and without the synergistic effect of Rituxan I would probably have relapsed by now.  I just think Big Business gets a bad rap in general from the liberal communist crowd and it is just not that way.  You have to take the good and the bad with all systems.  What would LeCarre have us put in place?  A system where the Government does all the research?  No Thanks.  My belief is I would be dead.  Since I believe it, it's true.  I'll take my chances with Big Pharma.  Meanwhile the weak minded soak up LeCarre's stories like they are fact, then point the finger at the multinationals, when it is all taken so grossly out of proportion.  So in telling well crafted lies which he terms fiction, LeCarre makes his living and in his way bilks the reader and does a disservice to the patient's suffering.  That's one way of looking at it anyway.  What system does he propose?  Communism?  No thanks we have been there and done that haven't we?  Don't get me wrong I liked the book and really want to see the movie.  It brought out the tragic beauty of Africa and the beauty of the depth of some of the relationships.  But I think there was a large dose of propaganda thrown in to boot 
 If you decide to purchase this book then please pay careful attention to Dan Corner's tactics and deception.  Dan refutations of eternal security proof texts such as Eph.4:30 and others are often not answered directly.  Instead of answering many eternal security proof text directly he instead will funnel our proof texts thru 1st Cor.6:9-11 as somehow proving that Paul must not have believed in eternal security. What Dan does is that he views 1st Corinthians 6:9-11 as proof that Paul didn't believe in eternal security and then will read 1st Cor.6:9-11 and his belief into any other passage that teaches eternal security such as Eph.4:30. If you look at the Scripture Index of his book then notice how often he refers to HIS proof texts and that is because he reads them into all of the eternal security proof texts that he has no direct argument for. He refers 58 times to 1st Corinthians 6:9-11 and 55 times (total pages) to Galatians 5:19-21 throughout his book when trying to refute eternal security. Please note how much he refers to his other proof texts in his index such as the 75 times that he refers to Rev.21:8 throughout his book. He tries to throw so much of his proof texts into our proof texts so as to hopefully drown out the plain teaching such as found in Eph.4:30. Does that sound scholarly to you?  Read a publication by Jehovah Witnesses on the trinity for they do the same thing. Dan's tactics would be like me refering 60 times to Eph.4:30, 58 times Romans 5:9,10 and 54 times referring to Eph.1:13,14 and then reading them into all of Dan Corner's proof texts. Will I get 5 stars for that kind of stragedy? Dan only proves that he doesn't have an answer but has to argue like a Jehovah Witness that comes knocking at your door. Have you ever debated a Jehovah Witness where you had quoted a clear verse of Scripture that states that Jesus is God only to have the Jehovah Witness not directly answer that verse but will run to a verse elsewhere that seems to appear contradictory to the verse that you just quoted?  THAT'S DAN CORNER FOR YOU!! If you compare eternal security books with books on conditionalism then you will find that eternal security actually tackles the problem texts head on while conditionalism does not but will read verses from other books of the Bible into that one verse in order to make you think that the author really didn't mean what it clearly seems to say in the verse.  Example: Eph.4:30 said those "having believed" are sealed unto the day of redemption guaranteed an inheritance.  Conditionalists realizing the clear wording will say "Well Paul in 1st Cor.6:9-11 said this...so obviously Paul didn't believe in eternal security" and that is how Dan deals with many eternal security proof texts. Dan also is great when it comes to arguing his logic and forces them into Scripture.  He accuses those that believe in eternal security for arguing from logic when over half his book is him doing it himself.   Dan's logic tells him that Judas had to be a saved man because Judas was a disciple.  OH REALLY? Dan Corner didn't think this one through and neither do his follower's.  Let's see how Dan didn't think through that:  1st, Jesus Himself said "Have I not chose you twelve and one of you is (present tense) a devil?"  How can a man be saved and a devil at the same time? Keep in mind that Jesus made that statement one year prior to His crucifixion. Second, Judas was described as a thief while still as a disciple but according to Dan, no thief is a saved man and the single act of thievery will cause you to lose your salvation.  In fact, there is not one thing good ever said about Judas. Dan Corner tried to describe Judas as one that gradually became evil.  I don't know how you become a gradually present tense "devil" a year before Jesus was betrayed by him.  In the Greek, the indefinite article "a" is absent before "devil."  That makes the comment by Jesus concerning Judas even more direct, Judas wasn't "a devil" but "devil" and certainly not one that was gradually becoming evil.  Thanks Dan because according to your thinking then we must have a saved present tense devil that was a thief still allowed to be a disciple.  This is Dan arguing logic here with no substance. Dan's view of the prodigal son is very amusing as well.  Here is a parable that pictures the love of God as well as a rebuke to the Pharisees that stood there complaining that Jesus receives sinner's. Now when dealing with Dan Corner disciples, I will ask them if the Pharisees were saved people in that chapter?  To my amazement, all of them say, "Of course not."  Do they not realize that the hateful son in that parable of the prodigal son was the Pharisees standing there?  Yes, many Dan Corner disciples know that but never thought about it. What they didn't think about is that the Pharisee is also called a "son" in that parable and therefore if I can use Dan's logic then they must be saved too, but we know that was not true at all. If you claim that the one son was saved then so is the other since he too is with the Father. Now if this parable is teaching that one is saved and then lost and then saved again then we have some problems in that passage.  1st, both sons are always referred to as "sons" ALWAYS and never became anything other than a son.  2nd, if you noticed, the the son that supposedly lost his salvation got it better the second time around. He got a ring and a robe and new sandals and God kissed Him and prepared a fatted calf for his return.  Wow! I say that we all lose our salvation so that God can do a better job saving us the second time around!!  Dan as he does every where else will read more into a passage than what is actually given there.  Sorry Dan, but this is not a picture of how God saves a man twice but to expose the hearts of the Pharisees who professed to be righteous and strict law abiders.  It showed the Pharisees how they were hateful and against God's love, mercy and grace.  This passage is dealing with Jewish people who were in a covenant relation with God, which made THEM ALL children of the covenant and children of God (covenant children and not children of grace), this was not the case with us Gentiles then.  The Pharisee in this passage which we know were unsaved and that Jesus called them "vipers" and full of "dead man bones" were called "SONS." The Pharisees are being described as sons too (by covenant and not by grace).  So we know that the Pharisees were not pictured as saved men but were being used as an example in Luke 15 to expose their hearts true condition.  If this is a picture of salvation then God has children that hate other believers.  Dan Corner will love to tell you that if you hate your brother then you abide in death (you lost your salvation) but then why doesn't Dan apply it here to the the hateful son, WHY DAN?  Because to admit that this pictures both the Pharisees and the Prodigal son as SONS by grace and not covenant would then put him in a position to deny what he believes elsewhere in Scripture and that Dan can never honestly do.  Sorry Dan, but this is God's covenant relation to Israel and that is why both Pharisee and the wayward child are both called sons (by covenant).  If you want to describe the one son as losing his salvation then I can say that the Pharisees who were being described in that passage as a son were saved men who obviously hated the grace of God in saving sinners. I hope now that you actually see the problem of reading a salvation message and making it "Saved, Lost and saved again" passage?? Somehow Dan Corner sees this hateful Pharisee which is opposed to God's love and mercy in this parable as a saved man.   Here is Dan at his best, you will find him quoting from the NIV, NKJV, KJV on just one page alone.  Now why does Dan do that? If Dan can find another version that can argue what he believes a little more convincingly then he will USE IT! Do you know that Jehovah Witnesses do the same thing concerning the trinity in their publication 'Should I believe the Trinity?'  Dan warns against using versions that seem to render a verse in favor of eternal security but doesn't tell you that he Bible hops in order to find a version that seems to support him.  He will quote the NIV in most places but certainly will not use it when it comes to Romans 8:1 and I hope you know why?? It is because most versions know that the King James Translator's added a phrase to "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus" in hopes of preventing careless living by borrowing words from verse 4.  Most manuscripts do not contain anything after "no condemnation" in verse one.  But good old Dan will certainly not quote the NIV, NASV along with many other versions because the verse refutes him!  Dan at his website gave GREAT arguments against those that hold to the King James Only position.  Dan went into great detail how "827 words and phrases" found in the KJV do not even exist in our today's English. He even posted an article called, 'Understandest What Thou Readest?' Dan in one of his articles said these words concerning the KJV onlyist that they are promoting "a very hard, if not sometimes IMPOSSIBLE, translation to understand." Dan points that it was the Catholic Priest Erasmus that was responsible for the Textus Receptus (used by KJV). Dan ended his one article with his recommendations for what version that one should use and his recommendations are: "NIV, NASV and NRSV" but NOT the KJV.  Guess what? None of Dan's recommended versions has the added clause that the KJV translator's threw into Romans 8:1. Dan also claims that most people that use the KJV believe in eternal security but that made no sense to me since if Erasmus was behind the KJV Textus Receptus. Certainly Erasmus and his Catholic beliefs of losing your salvation should be everywhere found in the KJV and guess what? You don't find such teaching in any version!!! Dan did a great job on the King James Version even showing many translation errors of the KJV and shows that you should use any of his recommended versions OTHER than the KJV.  Now I am not a King James onlyist and I agree with nearly all of Dan's arguments against KJV onlyists, but left reading his arguments confused. Ask yourself this, Why would Dan argue the KJV after his many arguments against using it at his website articles?  You guessed it, if the KJV can argue something that seems help him in his argument then he most certainly will use it. Can you not see his deceit here?  Anyone can find out that the KJV translator's added a phrase to verse one but Dan will not tell you that because the KJV appears to be his friend in that verse while all his other recommended Bibles refute him on Romans 8:1. Compare Romans 8:1 in the KJV to his recommended versions and you too will see for yourself why Dan chose to use the KJV which he elsewhere preaches against. Just remember, to Dan it is not okay for you to use another version that supports eternal security. Why can't I follow his same honesty as he does with the KJV by quoting 1st Cor.15:2 from the New Living Translation? The New Living Translation reads it as: "And it is this Good News that saves you if you firmly believe it-unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place."  As you can see, 1st Corinthians 15:2 now argues very strongly for those that believe in eternal security doesn't it?  Actually that translation accurately teaches what the whole passage is actually talking about.  Paul more than once in that chapter used the word "if" but NOT the way Dan would like you to believe.  Read the entire chapter for yourself and read where Paul said "IF there be no resurrection..." "IF Christ be not raised..." and ask whether Paul was arguing "if" as a condition where maybe Christ was not risen or maybe Christ had not died.  The passage is dealing with those denying the resurrection and if that be the case then their FAITH IS VAIN just like in verse 2.  The passage everywhere argues like verse 2 that if you are not believing something that is not true that Paul preached to you then your faith is VAIN. Paul more than once in that chapter used the words "then your faith is vain." The NLT seemed to understand that along with most scholars but Dan simply focused on just one word "if" and chose to ignore the context and Paul's usage elsewhere in that passage of the words "if" and "vain." Dan also loves Young's literal translation because the word "believe" is the "present tense" as meaning to Dan that one has to "continually believe" in order to be saved. Now why doesn't Dan quote Young's Literal Translation on many words that have believing with the result of HAVING eternal life and HAVING believed in the past tense?  Dan can't nor does offer any explanation to Acts 16:31 where the word "believe" is in the aorist tense, imperative mood.  He also doesn't point out John 6:69 ("believe")and 11:27 where the perfect tense is used.  The tense is defined as "an action which is viewed as having been completed in the past once for all."  Jesus cry from the cross "it is finished" is an example of a perfect tense, unless Dan says that "finished" must continue on but who knows what Dan thinks anyways??  By the way, I'm typing and that is in the present tense so does that mean that I cease not to type??  I love Dan's arguments concerning John 10:28,29! Dan says that the only person that has eternal life is the one that "follows" Jesus and that those that believe in eternal security are ignoring the context of verse 27.  NO NO NO, I don't think so Dan!  It is you Dan that is ignoring the context because it goes back to verse 24. "Follow" is the same as believing but Dan makes a distinction between "continual believe" of John 3:16 and "continual follow" of John 10:27. Wow Dan! Continual faith 100% of the time with continual obedience 100% of the time. Dan corner believes another gospel and should be feared. From Scripture, Dan Corner cannot be a saved man because he contradicts Paul. Dan Corner and his followers right now have before them conditional security and it is based on whether or not they will believe the free grace gospel offered to them in Scripture.  The Security is conditional upon their believing it, but if they persist in rejecting it then Scripture clearly teaches that their chance for eternal security is over at death.  Dan gave me a great book title "The Unbeliever's Conditional Security" where eternal security or eternal damnation are laid before your very eyes in Scripture.  Knowing that "follow" means to believe in that passage, does it appear conditional when Jesus said, "I give unto (now) them ETERNAL LIFE?"  Wow Dan, you can have eternal life for three days!  Sorry Dan, but my God offers salvation and not probation as your god does.  Look further at that verse, does it sound conditional when Jesus says: "...and THEY SHALL NEVER NEVER NEVER PERISH...NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND...NO MAN SHALL IS ABLE TO PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY FATHER'S HAND."  Conditonal? Yeah right, I guess "no man is able" only applies to your neighbor and not yourself according to Dan.  Sorry Dan but it is all inclusive. You have taken a security verse for a believer and made a mockery of God who promises eternal life and shall never perish into "you might never perish if you continually follow me." Thanks Dan, damn yourself with your heresy and not others please! Dan foolishly argues that Romans 8:35-39 does not include "sin" when it says that "NOTHING shall separate us from the love of God...."  Oh Dan, verse one states that there will be "NO CONDEMNATION" which means that there can be no charge brought against us, for our sins were thoroughly dealt with in Christ. The chapter beings with NO CONDEMNATION and ends with NO SEPARATION but you chose to play the fool. Don't you see that Dan is reading his words into passages of Scripture? Dan Corner shows his ultimate desperation when trying to refute Eph.1:13,14; 4:30 that deals with the believer being sealed unto the day of redemption. He only makes one comment on page 698 for Eph.1:13,14 and argues exactly how I told you he does at the beginning of my comments at the very top. He doesn't answer the verse but instead reads his prodigal son opinions into it and then Revelation 21:8.  He makes comments on Ephesians 4:30 on pages 117,446,459,473,541 but never deals with the verse directly. His only attempt at refuting it was to associate a spiritual seal that the Holy Spirit does to a physical seal that man does in Matthew 27:57,60. I hope that you can see the problem with that right away??? Dan was trying to show that the seal over Jesus tomb was removed and therefore a spiritual seal can be removed too. Why? Why? Why? Does our ignorant Conditionalist heretic choose to add conditional statements to a verse as though his god forgot to write in there so Dan feels obligated to do it for Him?  There is no Scripture that says man can remove a seal that God has set. Can man remove the seal of Revelation 20:3 or any other seal of God? Dan will say yes by sinning so therefore man can remove his own seal that God did Himself. Do you see how foolish it is to believe what Dan is teaching? He will take verses from everywhere else other than the verse itself in order to change its meaning. The verse says, "Sealed unto the day of redemption" but Dan will make that as "sealed unto the day of redemption maybe." Have you ever read a Conditionalists gospel tract?  Ask yourself if it sounds anything like the gospel presentation of Acts 16:31 or 1st Corinthians 15:3,4??? No it is not even close, they have thrown so many warnings and conditions into it that nobody will be saved by their gospel.  One thing that a Conditionalist will never be accused of even though they everywhere accuse me as they did the apostle Paul: "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"  The reason that nobody can ever make that mistake with Conditionalists is because they are so works oriented and nobody can walk away in their congregation saying "Wow! What a God of grace!!!" If you would like to have the loss of assurance of salvation, if you would like to be unhappy, if you like to be confused, if you like live uncertain of the present and future, if you would like to experience the love of God that is no better than that of abusive parents, if you want a twisted view of Scripture, if you want to join hands with the universal religion of losing your salvation belief, if you want a faith that constantly wavers, if you want a works oriented gospel that will damn a soul then please buy this book!  I think that you will not be disappointed by Dan's book! Take it from me who was once a former Conditionalist who struggled with doubt, confusion and a works oriented wesleyan gospel. Praise God for saving me from that!! Please take the time to read where I dive more into Dan Corner's book and his arguments under "Eternal Security" by Dr Charles Stanley. If you are struggling with assurance of salvation and would like some help then please email me. If you are a sincere seeker wanting to know if Salvation can or cannot be lost and need help with some problem verses or arguments then please email me. If you are only seeking to argue then don't bother for I delete such emails. Thank you p.s. I just like to say thank you for those that have emailed me. Some have only attempted to argue for Dan but others of you that have been Conditionalists for a long time have challenged your own position and one of you has recently rejected Dan's erroneous teaching and has trusted Christ after many years of believing that heresy of Conditionalism!!! That has been encouraging to me!  Thank you 
 I'm a big fan of Dan Poynter's book The Self-Publishing Manual, so I expected that this book would be of comparable quality.  Unfortunately, that just isn't the case.  There is some information relating to the "new book model" publication process that should be helpful, but what little information exists is difficult to extract from this book which has been very poorly designed and laid out.  The pages are constantly broken by quotes that loosely relate to the text, and this makes it difficult for the actual content to read smoothly.  The text itself seems disjointed as if Poynter has just copied and pasted passages of previous articles together, and little attention has been paid to making this a coherent and informative book.  The graphics used in the book are of poor quality- an obvious example of someone who doesn't know how to prepare graphics for print and an indication that this book was just slapped together.  I hope this isn't what Dan Poynter means by "The New Book Model", as this was an incredibly disappointing book both aesthetically and as a text.    While I think electronic publishing is a medium that's here to stay and incredibly valuable, I do disagreee with Dan Poynter's assertion in this book that "the only ink-on-paper ('dead tree') books in the future will be coffee table books- books as an art form.  These books will be used to decorate homes and offices.  Other information will be disseminated electronically without sacrificing trees."  Certainly this will never happen as long as "new book model" publishers publish books of this quality.  Consumers will demand books of greater informational value that present the information in an easy-to-absorb and attractive manner, which, I'm disappointed to discover, Dan Poynter is willing to sacrifice.  In any case, the fact is there are actually more trees growing in the United States now as a result of our vast use of paper and lumber than there were 200 years ago.  The "save the trees" argument for e-publishing is just wrong.  There are a lot of good reasons to e-publish, but trees aren't among them.  It's worth noting that far fewer trees would have died in the printing of this book had the author left out the exessive quotes and textboxes that pad this book's page-count.  All in all, I'm disappointed with Writing Nonfiction.  The information in this book that is of any value really belongs in Poynter's infinitely better and more comprehensive book, The Self-Publishing Manual.  One chapter would cover it.  I also recommend Avery Cardoza's The Complete Guide To Successful Publishing.  
 This book concentrates only in concise theory, don't giving any further explanation or real-life examples in music. Aside that, the book wastes several chapters in basic music theory telling what any amateur musician already know. For me it was useless 
 Not worth the money spent on it.  After reviewing info on my new digital camera I followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on AA batteries.  I did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  The batteries did not hold a charge.  I only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  If the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  At least I got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  I would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  I have had no experience with rechargables before so I do not know if this is common.  But I returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge 
 Disappointing:- very bad quality reproductions of Wllies drawings and photographs,they are blured and lose much of the detail. Many amateur drawings clearly not by Willie.Only good pics. are on the cover 
 This book seems to cover all the necessary topics for the 70-536 exam, but the errors/typos are totally unacceptable. This is probably the most poorly edited book I've ever read. Repeated paragraphs, copy-and-paste errors, code that doesn't compile....you lose confidence in the book and when something doesn't make sense, I find myself wondering if I don't understand the concept or if it's just another error.  Again, if you can get past the errors, the book does cover all of the necessary topics.  
 I was disappointed that this book talked only about children identified as gifted when in preschool or earlier.  The anecdotes and examples all refer to children less than 8, usually less than 6.  It is not uncommon for a child to be identified or maybe even BECOME? gifted until later.  I know several kids who weren't "certifiably" gifted until 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades, even one in the 7th grade.  I was hoping for more information on identifying giftedness in these 'older' children 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 I ordered this book on approval after one of my art students told me she had learned of its existence.  Betty Edward's original Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain was instrumental in opening the mysterious world of drawing to me and I am grateful to her for giving me my start in formal training.  It spurred me to apprentice with an accomplished local artist in my community, I am sure many hundreds of thousands of others can attest to the same.  I wish I could say that I actually purchased the new Color book, but alas I could not.  I sent it back.  It was just too scattered and too wordy without being clear to be used for a student to begin the complex task of mastering color.  The colors recommended were  very odd choices for beginners, leaving out some very important basics.  The exercises weren't well organized and the general order of the book is jumbled at best.  It would be useful for someone who has absolutely no access to art classes and or a bookstore or a good public library where can be found literally hundreds of good books by professional artists and art instruction books not a few of which are on the subject of color.  
 Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy.  Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war  color Talese's story from start to finish.  These themes give the tale a  characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places.   In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to  be trying to put forth during the entire story.  These perspectives, and  those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of  interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of  traditional native Italian scholars.  Still, the book is in a bold attempt  at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the  Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
 I read more than half the book and still nothing much had happened. I found not a whole lot to really like and cheer for in Nick. She seems flat and one dimensional.It seems the characters were used to advance a cause. I  felt as though I was being preached to. The women in Six of One were gay  and they lived their robust, colorful lives in the book with out any  comentary on what we should feel about them. I loved them because they were  real and and reachable. They just were what they were. They were a part of  the beautiful woven fabric of Six of One. I felt like I was supposed to  feel sorry for Nick in Bingo because she is gay. Why 
 I bought Guerolito after hearing "Heaven Hammer," the remixed version of Guero's "Missing."  That remix, by Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of "Missing" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting sonic landscape.  That song became astonishing where the Guero song was simply alright, and the new song, "Clap Hands," is at least a good time.  However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of, say, "Earthquake Weather," (here as "Terromoto Tempo") are both individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other.  "E-Pro" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely "Farewell Ride" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole 
 This deck is odd, to each his own, I suppose. Firstly, swords and wands are transposed, with swords representing fire and wands representing air. This would be OK to work with, except the card meaning are not representative of the elements....the meanings of the swords are still equated with knowledge, intellect, thought, justice and truth...but are now associated with fire, rather than air. The wands cards represent creativity, action, movement, enthusiasm, and career....but are classed under the element of air....this is rather confusing to new readers who are used to the Rider-Waite associations.  The hierophant as elephant?? Surely that must be a joke.  I just can't take this deck seriously. I'd call it more bizarre than inspired. 
 At the end of this movie, which i wasted 7 dollars 10 people at once said in unison, That was horrible. The movie isn't scary, the plot is patched together like a class of 1st graders trying to make a novel and they all have to write one page.  The acting is well horrible.  The visuals were cool but i think a lot of that was that they were on a big screen.  Personally I laughed threw the whole thing and i guess my money was well spent cause all my buddy's were reference the horrible and pointless climatic scene.  
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Some guy in NYC gets up on a building and starts shooting people in the ketchup packets.  A father kills his family (off camera). A policeman shoots a few people in a parade.  Seemingly random acts of violence except that all the perpetrators said "God told me to."  Shocking!  A detective who's chest hair shortens dramatically when he walks from the bedroom to the bathroom is assigned to the case and I have no idea what he figures out cause after 70 minutes of talk, talk, talk I started the 2x play until he came across some wacked out squealing dude in an abandoned building who has a p###y on his chest!  The cop beats the guy down then says "God told me to."  I never want to see this movie again as long as I live. 
 Levine repeats the most obvious, readily available information in a superficial attempt to somehow "prove" what any Civil War historian worth a penny knows - that the Confederate government did not officially approve Black enlistment until March, 1865.  What he does not address is what was actually taking place in the field.  Black Confederates in combat appear in the Federal Official Records, Northern and Southern newspapers, the letters and diaries of Union and Confederate soldiers, the Slave Narratives, books by and about the United States Colored Troops, and newspapers of the 20th C:  Elgin (Illinois) Daily Courier-News, Monday, April 12, 1948 - "Robert (Uncle Bob) Wilson, Negro veteran of the Confederate army who observed his 112th birthday last January 13, died early yesterday morning in the veterans' hospital at the Elgin State hospital...He enlisted as a private in Company H of the 16th regiment of Virginia Infantry on Oct. 9, 1862 and discharged May 31, 1863."   The Project Manager of the National Park Service African-American History Web Project commented (June 20, 2005),"While some free African Americans served in the Confederate army, their role is not as well documented and preserved.  In addition, many African Americans who served in some capacity in the Confederate army, often anonymously, were slaves."  How is it that Levine is not aware that the Federal government recognizes the existence and service of Black Confederates?  Levine's book is yet another proof that anyone willing to support and tow the "company line" can find a major publisher, but anyone who wants to do more than scratch the surfac on potentially controversial topics is limited to small private printings.  Incidentally, in February, 1861, the South was offered the 13th (Corwin) Amendment which would have permanently protected slavery in America (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_amendment).  This did not motivate the South to return to the Union.    In December, 1862, Lincoln offered a plan of graduated, compensated emancipation which would have perpetuated slavery until 1900 - that did not motivate the South to return to the Union.   The South did not secede to protect slavery and the Union - with its Union slave states protected by the Emancipation Proclamation - remained a slave nation until December, 1865, some eight months after the Confederacy ceased to exist.  Levine is just another so-called "scholar" whose commission is to support the edited, expurgated, abridged, and thoroughly rewritten "history" of the Civil War.  This was predicted all too clearly in January, 1864, by Irish-born Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne:  "Every man should endeavor to understand the meaning of subjugation before it is too late...It means the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy; that our youth will be trained by Northern schoolteachers; will learn from Northern school books their version of the war; will be impressed by the influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors, and our maimed veterans as fit objects for derision...The conqueror's policy is to divide the conquered into factions and stir up animosity among them... 
 Very Flaky with bluetooth after few days, no support phone #, don't waste your $$$. 
 I havent get the book yet???? back order it is been like almost 2 months 
 This item is absolutely worthless, don't waste your time! I'm returning mine to Target tomorrow.   There are laws against false advertising, I don't know why they're not enforced.  I will never buy ANYTHING made by Belkin again.   
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 This stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners.  This was the first stability ball DVD that I purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level.  If you are a beginner, I would recommend Leslie Sansone's You can do Stability Ball training.  If you are a beginner or more advanced, I would recommend Denise Austin's Shrink the Female Fat Zone or the QuickFix Stability Ball training.  My all time favorite DVD for the stability ball is Denise Austin.  This is by far my least favorite. 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy!  I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn.  I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch.  
 So-So story about a man's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star's mother.  Like that old Dickie Roberts movie, it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars, but does not do a good job of it.  Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple, where are you when we need you?    
 Clive Cussler made his reputation writing books with plots that are barely believable using characters that are totally unbelievable saving the world over and over again from his perch in an unknown but extremely powerful U.S. government agency. After many successful books, Clive perfected the formula and is now sharing it with Paul Kemprecos who co-writes an analogous series which uses the same agency, plots, and characters. Oh, this series does change some things, the main character is Kurt not Dirk and his sidekick is Mexican and not Italian. Also, there is a second pack of characters (Paul and Gamay Trout) who allow the plot to develop through a second set of eyes.  None of which takes away from the formulaic tone of this series and this book in particular. In typical fashion, the first chapter is a historical look that "sets the stage." In this case it is an aerial combat over the Alps in 1914 between an industrialist and six (6!!) combat pilots. Needless to say, the industrialist holds his own and manages to down four of his foes before he himself is shot down and killed. The next chapter comes to the present time and takes off a second thread - this time it is a "survivor"-type of reality show which is interrupted by an attack of some mutated beings. The third chapter starts pulling all these disparate threads together and off we go.  Unfortunately, this book is too formulaic. It does not take the reader long to realize who the threat is, nor does it take us long to see the connections between the various threads. The only real complication is a completely preposterous connection between the bad guy's attempt to take over the world and an infestation of some new kind of sea weed that tries to take over the oceans.  As is usual in these novels, there are high speed car chases, underwater action, aerial acrobatics (in world war 1 vintage planes no less!), underwater escapades and explosion galore. throughout them all, the hero gets a bit bruised but the thugs all manage to get killed (Even though they are supposedly highly trained special forces types) and the world is rescued by the effort of one man - Kurt Austin. There is a love interest (why a different one in each book? Doesn't he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest?) who is French, and side visits to Scotland and Massachusetts.  The only unique thing about this book was that it was the first time that I was exposed to the "Premium" format which is a slightly longer/taller book with more space between the lines. The book cover states that this format is "Specially designed for comfortable reading" but I cannot say that it improved things for me that much.  To summarize, as a Clive Cussler fan, I had to read this book to make sure I keep up with the adventures, but this one is not in the top two-thirds of his efforts. I am sure that Kurt Austin will reappear soon and hope that the next one will be more interesting and fun to read 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 I havn't heard this album, so I'll do a review of RBX in general.        I've heard him only on the Marshall Mather's LP' "Remember Me", and if his performance on that track is reflective of his other work, then there is no reason for anyone to buy this.  Half of his verse on that track don't even rhyme!!  Plus, his voice is more like talking in a possessed way then rapping.  Here, I'll paste his verse from "Remember Me.":  For this one it's the X, you retarded? Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN, like Syndrome Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries which qualifies me for the term "universal" Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controversial Like I'm not, the one you wanna contest, see cause I'll hit yo' a** like the train did that b*tch  that got "Banned From TV" -- heavyweight hitter Hit you watch your whole head split up Loco-is-the-motion, we comin through Hollow tips is the lead, the .45 threw   Oh my god, that is TERRIBLE!!  There were like two lines that rhymed in the whole thing!!  What was Dre thinking putting him on Chronic?  Wasn't it bad enough with Snoop Dogg? 
 If you speak Spanish, you will be dismayed to hear how bland and shapeless his poems sound in English.  Speaking of bland, the singing and music here is dullsville.  With so many great Brazilian singers, why not listen to some old Joao Gilberto, or Joao's daughter Bebel, or Marisa Monte or Caetano Veloso.  If you want the poetry of Neruda, reading it is more satisfying.  This is a terrible combination of music and poetry. (Later comment: I listened to this cd again and I probably had unfair expectations and was unduly harsh.  It's a pretty recording and Souza can sing...it still all kind of sounds the same, but 3 stars instead of 1. 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 I've read through Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums" guide and it has some real problems, all of which add up to it being extremely unhelpful for someone honestly looking for great albums.  I considered giving this guide a higher rating simply because I agree that many of the albums included really are great, but the writing (or really, the lack thereof) is so bad that this book couldn't possibly be helpful to anyone who was not already familiar with the albums.  This book gets off to a preposterous start when the editor claims that the Beatles' first album should be the number one album because it is the first one that HE bought, and getting all nostalgic about it makes him feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Wha?!  And this guy is the editor?!  That's not a basis for an argument for an album's position on a list ranking greatest albums!  That should have told me what I was getting myself into by continuing to read.  If you were to ask yourself whether or not you know anything new about the music after reading the article for any given album in this book, most likely the answer will be no (especially for 11-500).  You may know that the drummer spilled beer on his drum kit while recording the big hit single, or some other piece of at best marginally useful information, but that's about it.  And they don't even put much effort into providing much in the way of that level of information beyond the first 10 albums, the rest only get a paragraph of completely obvious and/or useless information.  For a while I was under the impression that "Rolling Stone" was a music magazine that was knowledgeable about and understood and appreciated music (well, rock music at least, in the most narrow definition of the term, and perhaps blues, the father of rock).  This book and other publications such as their brazenly mindless album guide, truly show what little respect and appreciation that they have for music.  I almost get the impression that they want to show that they are too cool to take music seriously enough to put any thought or effort into what they write.  They rarely even attempt to make a convincing argument as to why the albums hold the positions that they do in this book.  It's clear after reading this guide AND their magazine review section for a while that the critics at Rolling Stone do not thoroughly listen to albums, and that they rate music based on things that have nothing to do with the merits of the material.  They rate music based on type and image more than anything else, being much more concerned with shaping and pushing their idea of "cool" than with the actual merits of the music.  It's obvious that they don't even understand jazz (which I guess goes hand in hand with not understanding even the fundamentals of music theory), but there are many areas of music that they don't seem to understand or appreciate.  I don't see how it is at all helpful to judge music by how closely it adheres to aesthetic characteristics that are generally specific to the type that you like.  Those that fit the mold will likely be overrated and those that don't will likely be underrated.  Rolling Stone takes this unbelievably self-indulgent approach throughout this book.  So this guide ends up being really unhelpful.  But hey, where else are you going to find a book with so many pretty and glossy artist and album cover photos :-)?  Unless that's what you're looking for though, you're better off saving your money.  The ONLY consistently helpful and reliable expert critical review source that I'm aware of is "Wilson & Alroy's Record Reviews", so you should go over there and check out their site and their "5 Star Records" page in particular if you want a truly helpful guide to some great albums.  
 Jagged Edge's second attempt to me was no better than the first. Jagged gave me two songs that I listen to and the rest is pure filler.  I stopped buying their music after the second album.  Even though their specialty is ballads, it seems that's all they can do and quite frankly, I can't sit there and listen to someone give anesthesia from my player.  I love ballads like the next person, but variety is the spice of life and they are just not providing it for me again.  Disappointing!  Grade:  
 Looks fine, and the first try was okay, in fact quite fun to see the coins begin to sort.  Unfortunately it started jamming and trapping the coins in the top compartment, where they are a hassle to get out.  I checked the instructions and tried everything: one coin at a time, used a level to make sure the surface was flat, etc.  But it just won't reliably sort the coins without collecting them and jamming.  We opened it last night and it is being sent back this morning.  Perhaps you get what you pay for 
 I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6 
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
      Overall, I found this episode in the life and adventures of Randy Komisar to be interesting, but not groundbreaking.  Though certainly filled with some valuable insights, there was something more to be desired.  There was still a lot to learn, however, the most important being the general observations from a real-life perspective on what it takes to enjoy life in the entrepreneurial world.      The work itself was often scattered and forced.  There was no real continuity between the flashbacks, often sounding as if Mr. Komisar decided to insert various triumphs in his life whenever he felt like it.  Furthermore, I found the characters of Lenny and Allison to be more symbolic than human.  They were not actual individuals, but prompts put in by Komisar to respond to the questions he wanted answered.  In his interactions with them, Komisar walked an unhealthy line between humility and arrogance, presenting himself as a sort of low-key person who thinks outside the box, yet is always right on everything and draws reverence from those around him.  At times, I wondered whether this book was more of a teaching tool or a testament to his own greatness.      I found his main message to be useful, but somewhat hypocritical.  His criticism of the "work first and then retire" philosophy struck especially close to home, as that is one I have often embraced.  I paid close attention to his words and was partially persuaded.  I think he is downright contradictory, however, when he tries to use his own life as an example of how a business does better when fueled by complete passion and the expectation of it being one's life's work.  There were many times when I felt like screaming out, "Mr. Komisar, practice what you preach!"  Furthermore, I can think of so many ways that his theory is wrong.  Sometimes, the best businessman is one who has passion for what he/she is doing, but also has the ability to be objective and analyze the situation with an objective business savvy.  When he and his mentor Campbell (of Columbia fame!) ran GO to the ground, sticking with it through its crash landing, he writes as if that is a good thing.  That is fine when you have enough money to absorb that kind of failure, but most beginning entrepreneurs do not.  Komisar got where he is because of the strategy he condemns.      The other major problem with the book is the premise of funerals.com.  I found it to be a very poor example, as it unjustly generalized the funeral market.  While I am sure there are funeral homes who take advantage of people in their vulnerable, grieving states, I cannot think of anything less comforting than making arrangements over a computer instead of with people.  The character of Allison in representing the opposite extreme really represented absurdity.  If she were so feeling and caring, why not establish a not-for-profit website for grieving families?  I was never convinced that they were after anything but money, and the only evidence that their purpose was primarily moral was Komisar merely claiming it.  If this had been some kind of technological advancement in medicine, for instance, then I could have understood the enduring desire to save lives while also profiting.  The funeral example, however, is weak at best, and so is the pathetic Celestine Prophecy/Richest Man in Babylon rip-off with the riddle.      The strength of the book is in Komisar's thoughts about achieving happiness in life rather than about success in business.  Unlike the other characters, I was able to connect with Komisar as a human being, experimenting with different companies and developing his own tastes.  I gained a lot from reading his experiences, even if they were disjointed, and while I may have disagreed with him on some points, I learned from them.  I am glad I read the book, found it useful, but would hardly call it a masterpiece. 
 The intructors areant that motiviating. I dont really like the intructors because they instruct with almost to life in their voices or in their eyes. Everytime I do my workout they look more like female robots than real people. It is a fast workout and will take time to adjust to the movements. It would be a good idea to preview before you buy 
 This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans.  The characters in this story were likable.  I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view.  I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.  However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable.  From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the "cool" kids would turn out.  I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother.  Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc.  Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest 
 I'm sorry to say, mr. Beitler appears to be a really nice guy, but the book is often basic, broad and opinions are not always well fundamented. It is a great source for a lot of researches others did on OC related subjects, however, this book is for a large part no more than a summary of research findings of  these others. This book, since it provides a lot of findings, can be helpful for writing a masters thesis. For people who never read about OC before; buying this book can at least give you some helpful insights and a lot of advises for concrete action. For others; maybe Kotter or Burke can be more useful to gain insight in and knowledge of the subject of OC 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 This thing couldn't even penetrate a large can and skipped about on a small can.  This is going back to Amazon even though I have to eat the shipping charges.  An e-mail to Hamilton Beach remains unanswered 
 I kept reading the book, hoping to find one of the stories that really would have a profound impact on me. It just didn't "happen" for me. Most of the stories have very predictible outcomes 
 Hart's book was exceptionaly weak in content, spending the majority of the time on justification of methodology.  Whenever one thought that an opportunity presented itself to deal with GREECE and GENDER, immediately the reader was bounced across the Atlantic to issues of African American radicalism or culture in the United States.  This could have been a great book, if it were 120 pages that actaully dealt with Greece and utilized primary sources as opposed to secondary theoretical sources.  Conjecture is not history 
 I was very disappointed in the taste of this item.  Not at all what I expected from Splenda.  It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.  For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor.  Much too strong.  I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question! 
 Whoever the Engineer was on this 2ble CD, they must have an IQ of 2020 and the worst hearing ever. The sound on this 2ble album is totally abysmal. I bought this because of all the tracks what I didn't count on was the awful sound. Be smart, by the latest version of their one CD Greatest Hits album, the sound is fantastic on that. Why these morons didn't use that sound on this album is beyond me. 
 Reading other reviewers' positive words on this page, you would never know that Rose's book is riddled with errors of fact, despite her almost total dependence on secondary sources.  But a discerning reader might wonder at the facile slippage between person and movement (as she does with the life and family of Theodor Herzl in her psychoanalytical outlook) or at the extrapolation of a full blown theory from interviews with a few fanatic settlers.  How she manages to get Shabtai Zvi as the remote founder of her version of 'apocalyptic' Zionism (oops, messianism) is likewise unconvincing.  Rose is a talented professor of English; she should stick to her last 
 There is nothing remotely heavy and/or musical about this band. Every song uses the same three powerchords, the same drum lines, the same taking-a-dump vocal histrionics, the same lyrics of no substance and one subject. Do yourselves a favor and find something actually artistically worthy of the intelligent mind, and don't be fooled into thinking that this is heavy in any non-primitive way 
 Game has no quick saves,enemy shots are always accurate,yours are not.Enemy shots go thru solid surfaces.As combat vetern of Vietnam this game is not realistic 
 not helpful as I thought. it is so technical, I am an artist, no a paint solution maker 
 I bought her because martina mcbride is my favorite singer and then my lil sis gotm madded and she chopped of the head  ~7 year old 
 In terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - "Rent" has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.  The story, a modern day update of "La Boheme" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them "deadbeats") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.  "Rent" - with its noble "performance artists" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical "Angel") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded "job" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.   With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.   In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.    As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of "the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.    There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.   I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for "Rent" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially "sensitive" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free 
 Unfortunately, any book that seeks to redress "historical imbalance" by putting the remaining myths of aboriginal peoples on par with scientific data fails at its assigned task.  Unfortunate because this  is a well written book that does a very good job of outlining events in the  American expansion with reference to Indians 
 Mr. Shuman's theory was interesting, but a bit hard to swallow. Without any solid facts to back it up its just more hype. What he took 300 pages to write he could have said in 10. Most of the book was about patting hiself on the back for being such a smart guy 
 This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough 
 I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe.  Well, after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever.  The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward.  He never looked comfortable.  The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable.  These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky.    This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it.  The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it.  The canopy is also terrible because it barely works.  It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky.  I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face.  (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down)  I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake.  I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric).    We are both soooo much happier.  He looks comfortable and a little more reclined.  The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else.  I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did).  But in actuality it just sucks.  I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional. 
  Having seen and enjoyed the movie years ago, I was intrigued to get the whole story.  Books usually tell it so much better.  This one doesn't.  So, if you're looking to read a better version of the movie, this isn't it - go buy the script.    There's no drama, no character development, no humor, no love story!  It's just imagery, imagery, imagery.  BORING.  It was good for putting me to sleep, but that's about it.  Here's the cliffsnotes version of the book:  Two professors go to Italy, buy a house, fix it up, visit it every summer and Christmas and serve lots of dinners to lots of other people, all who have no story to tell either.  You also get a lot of descriptions of doorways and vegetables.  There, you've read it!    Whoever wrote the script for the movie was a genius to find a way to make something interesting out of this SNOOZEFEST!  Save your money, go rent the movie 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 Written okay, but I mean REALLY! Why not saint the individual who is the subject of this book? Perhaps he could walk on water to among all of his other suprahuman qualities???? If you take the time to read the reviews here - all by people who are wannabe Indians and/or haters of their own heritage and race, you'll get a very distorted view of what this book contains - which is a record of brutality, sadistic butchery, and mindless aggression against other peoples, until of course, elements like the Texas Rangers and US Army took the starch out or fight out of said noble Red Aristocrat. This sort of quasi-sob story type of literature (proliferating these days) dealing with people and events of the past really are annoying. Much better books are Cremony's LIFE AMONG THE APACHES, Utley's INDIAN WARS, and also SCALP DANCE, all available here at amazon.co 
 I did not check the copyright date (2000) before purchasing the book, which I hoped to use as a resource in a seniors internet class that I teach. Unfortunately, this means that this information is 5 years old. On the first two pages alone, only 2 out of 10 web addresses are still valid. Not worth the price. The links that DO still work are helpful, that is the only reason for the one star 
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).  
 After reading all these reviews, I bought the book thinking I was buying THE infertility book must-have. It's OK. Not great, not bad, but not what the hype here led me to believe. I'll keep it in the library, but I'll be more careful about buying based on reviews here 
 My main problem with the book was this: we find that the author stole some tapes while on the payroll of Mr. Townshend. From that point on, the book takes on a very smarmy feel, and to me, ends up sounding like he is trying  to get himself back into Peter Townshend's good graces. The stuff on the  early years, childhood, etc, was interesting, some new stuff on the Who's  beginning (although better covered in Kieth Moon bio). Overall a  disappointment to a long standing Townshend/Who fan. You can still learn  more about the subject from listening to his music 
 icky.  I like MNS.  A lot.  I like the things he says in interviews, I like his movies.  I don't think they are perfect, but they speak to me.  This book, while an interesting and easy read, is not fun.  I can't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it....he hasn't really publicly commented on it, other than to say the author had his full support.  I don't know--it just seemed a weird portrait of someone...it seemed over-dramatic and Vanity Fair article-esque.  Or like Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Ew.  I don't know what MNS is really like or if Bamberger interpreted things accurately.  I just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently.  [... 
 When i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought. i havent used them since i bought them...i sent in a questionairre sort-of-deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange, but i havent heard a thing from them. i'm not very pleased. 
 I was deeply saddened and apalled that this director would have adult men attempting to rape and impregnate a child , you should be ashamed of yourself for featuring rape in your movie , I'd like to drop a load on this dvd for having such shocking conten 
 I've met the type before: pompous blowhards who let it slip that they've attended the LSE. Well, (setting aside the intellectual sins of the Webbs and other silly fabians) it turns out that LSE will take just about anyone willing to pay full tuition, which is how they subsidize the students they really want to recruit. In return, these rich kids get to blather on forever about that scintillating course on The Rise of the Working Class or some such nonsense they took and which they beleive entitles them to tell you their opinion on any subject, no matter how poorly thought out that opinion is. Ms. Huffington is an exemplar of this sort, and I had only to scan this book at the local bookstore to confirm my opinion that she's another long-winded blather machine, spitting out empty rhetoric and cheap slogans for the zealots who cling to her every idiotic word, hoping they too can appear sophisticated and cosmopolitan even as they get drunk on populist punch. Egads, if we had the kind of populist movement Ms Huffington purports to want, it would make the mob murder of Leo Frank (see Tom Watson, Agrarian Rebel) seem like a garden pic-nic. In fact, Ms. huffington is the mirror image of President Bush - another rich dumb bunny, but she really seems to believe she knows something profound, whereas as least W knows he ain't all that smart. Take a pass on this book and read some Evelyn Waugh 
 Even great recepies with no pictures to show in how to present the food as a gift, end up been just a cook book 
 This is lushly detailed book with fine reproductions.  However, I found the book to be full of editorial errors and blunders.  Why should consumers be asked to pay one-hundred dollars for a book that is this poorly edited?  Profits should go towards finding new editorial help.  Let's hope the new edition finds someone in charge that is more organized and observant 
 If you loved their first album, a combination of folk and pschydelic/acid rock with long, multidimentional songs, this is going to be a big disappointment: short, simple, country/blue grass pop songs with some of  the worst lyrics of the period. Imagine the very worst songs of early  Jefferson Airplane. This sounds like a Holiday Inn band you would have  heard in the early seventies

 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 People who write books like this get invited to all the right places in this country. The reason is simple. Our system is is only possible medical system. It's not that other systems do not exist - it is that people in our system cannot even IMAGINE that other viable systems exist, must less that they function quite well. We never hear about them except in the negative. Sally Pipes would never be allowed to speak in our system unless she came with a satchel of critcisms of her own system. That was her ticket - that's how she got on stage. There's a pervasive sort of censorship going on here made all the worse because people in this country don't know how pervasive that censorhsip is. We are a free and open and intellectually closed shop.   Sally Pipes will hit the forum circuit down here and get invited to all the interview shows. This is because she criticizes the Canadian system.  Were she to praise it, she might as well be sitting in an igloo.  
 The content is somewhat dated, so of limited use to anyone seeking  detailed information. The author struggles to explain concepts in parts, suggesting that he has been less than meticulous in his research. There are better books available 
 I love Branford Marsalis' music. I've been following his stuff for 20 years. When I saw this new DVD a couple months ago, I thought 'what a find'! Unfortunately, it's a bust. It sounds like four guys playing, but none is really listening to any of the others. I'd save my money and pass on this one if I had it to do over 
 If you don't enjoy baseball at all, then you won't enjoy this movie 
 Type was too small for practical use in the kitchen. Ifound the chapter on equipment to be somewhat lacking by not discussing all alternatives such as the section on cutting boards only mentions one type and does not discuss the pros and cons of wood, glass, etc.  The tips are all pretty much the same tips and ideas I got from my first copy of "Joy of Cooking" 40 years ago.  The best, and certainly not the greatest, portion of the book was the recipes.  Several were very good 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 (2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for??? My husband really loved this bag because it wasn't 'girly or babyish' but put the $$ on something that will hold a bottle! 
 I come from a swimming background, and I am focusing my training on the improvement of my biking and running skills.  I still like to spend about half of my weekly exercise time in the pool.  If you enjoy swimming, avoid this book.  It is for the pool-fearing 
 oh yoko you did it again. I love The Beatles, but what has been done in this CD is unremarkable 
 I read a lot of biography and I have tremendous respect for Sandra Day O'Connor.  I thought, for sure, this was a win-win combination for this book.  Sadly, I only made it three quarters through before I donated it to the local library.  It is well written but dry 
 They are warm and comfortable while they last.   All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.   It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months 
 If I could give this no stars I would. I bought this magazine because Nickelodeon programs are my sons favorite to watch. I bet they were banking on that when they made this sorry exuse of a children's magazine. Not even HALF of the magazine is ad free!!!! I bought this to keep my son busy on a flight, and he looked at it maybe two minutes. I wondered why, since he loves everything else Nick, so I looked inside for myself. Boy was I dissapointed. Instead of the quality children's material I had hoped for, it was just ad after ad. I'm glad I only bought one issue in the airport, instead of being one of the unfortunate people to purchase an entire subscription before seeing it's lack of content. If you want a great children's magazine, go for Ladybug for younger children and Cricket for older children. They are both high quality and they aren't stuffed full of advertisements like Nick 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word

 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 As much as I like the author's "Building Construction", this book is not recommended. It is based on the premise that many construction details share common principles: shed water by using sloping surfaces, for instance. After a few such groupings are described, it turns into a tips and tricks collection, e.g., do rough work before finish work. It's not a comprehensive reference by any means. On the contrary, it's shamefully padded with many nearly blank pages. Enjoyable reading, nice drawings, just not nearly enough  material to justify the price 
 Whoa...my sisters have this set at their house, which I used extensively last night to cut with. In a word? Terrible.   They have not used them much, and all they had for me was a glass cutting board (I know, terrible). Due to the glass cutting board, I knew these edges, had they been used, would not be terribly sharp.  I made a point of sharpening them on the included steel using the procedure outlined in the manual.  Anyhow, I found myself both struggling and TEARING vegetables when cutting them. To slice red pepper, I was having to pull the remaining portion of the pepper up to tear it off of the piece I *thought* I'd just cut.   Perhaps this is a terribly unfair comparison, as I am used to my Henckels Pro "S" set. But for crying out loud, I didn't think it would be THIS bad.  While I cannot speak for the rest of the Henckels "International" (meaning "Made in Spain, not Germany") line, this set was very much unacceptable. You would literally get a better value buying a Henckels 4-Star Chef's Knife instead of this WHOLE SET. At least you'd get some real use out of it.  The steak knives feel cheap. This is definitely a $60-feeling set, no great "value," in my opinion. I would never, ever, ever buy a Henckels International product after this interlude and will happily return home tonight to my Henkels Pro "S" set...where cutting through ANYTHING is like gliding through soft butter 
 I got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas, this is undrinkable. In fact, it's unsmellable. I opened the tin, and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural. Smelled and tasted like handcream. Yes, I actually tasted it. Furthermore, the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy - the quality you'd find in a no-name tea from the dollar store. The tab simply said Ceylon tea. It looks like "Bentley" got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds, sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin. I gave it one star for the tin. If you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea, don't buy this one 
 "Ben Franklin of Old Philadelphia" was a very poorly written and boring book. I think this book was very boring because it was indescriptive and had very little action. This is a biography of Benjamin Franklin. I am not trying to imply that Benjamin Franklin lived a boring life. It is just that this book does not describe Benjamin Franklin's life very well. I highly recommend you DO NOT read this horrible book, and if you are one of those stubborn people who must read this very undetailed book anyway, I suggest that you read a couple pages, then skip ten times as many pages as you just rea 
 My wife & I have used an older version of the Interplak for about 3 years before it lost pressure.   We decided it was a pretty good buy for $25.99.  WRONG!   The "replacement" is not the same at all.  It is: NOISIER HAS LESS PRESSURE THE PRESSURE DOESN'T adjust AND WORSE, it causes static to occur on the TV while running.  Don't waste you money on this one.   We are very disappointed 
 This book appears to be a compilation of pamphlets from 1919 to 1949 by "The Tibetan" communicating clairaudiently with Ms Bailey. Opinion seems to be divided as to whether books such as this are works of great spiritual value or are Satanic works connected with the "New World Order".  The world according to "The Tibetan" appears to be governed by someone called Sanat Kumara (obviously, a slight shuffle of the letters changes Sanat to Satan), who is also known as "Ancient of Days", "the true Light of the World" and "the Eternal Youth". Supposedly leading to him are "the One Universal Church", "the sacred inner lodge of all true Masons" and the "inner-most circles of the esoteric societies". The masonic movement is described as "a far more occult organisation than can be realised".  There are some controversial statements to be found within these pages: fascism and communism are described as "great world ideologies" (p126); "reincarnation is a basic law of nature" (p232); "the Axis nations need to grasp the teaching of the Buddha, Lord of Light" (p359); Gandhi is described as someone who "brings into clear perspective the uncompromising fanatical attitude" and who "would precipitate civil war in India" (p368); "the Jews should recognise the Christ as the messiah" (p545). Possibly worst of all are the statements that "the Japanese nation must go back to the nursery state" (p428) followed by a comment on page 491 that "the release of atomic energy in connection with the bombing of Japan" was "the greatest spiritual event which has taken place since the the human kingdom appeared".   What else? "Schools of thought and world religions are to be blended into one" (p30), "Jews are to be integrated into society" (p77). The finale can be found on page 566: apparently "seeds have been planted for a 'final act of destruction' when humanity and Heirarchy are 'completely fused and blended'".  I found most of the book to be repetitive waffle about world peace, Masters, ashrams, service, etc. The "Heirarchy" is supposedly based at the "Great White Lodge on Sirius" and it would appear that the one world religion is to be a mix of Christianity and Buddhism.    Atheism never appeared so attractive 
 ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when  it first came out and, sadly,  still it's very weak.  I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing.  By far it's his worst album.  He needs to get back with Dan the Automator or something, these tracks are boring and go nowhere, with a couple exceptions-- so if it's dirt cheap it's worth grabbing. This does nothing for me, I hope he gets back on track 
 The coat quality was poor. It was very thin and looked cheap. I returned unworn 
    The title of this book could not be more fitting, as it Copan's flawed and ridiculous INTERPRETATION of Scripture and the nature of God.    Copan needs to read up on some verses, namely, Jeremiah 10:23, John 5:19 and 15:5, and Philippians 2:13, not to mention Proverbs 16:9 and 19:21, all of which shoot down the notion of man's supposed sovereign "free will", which legalists like to think will somehow override the actual sovereign will of God.  L. Ray Smith's website, Bible-Truths.com, has some excellent refutations of the "free will" notion.    He also needs to study the Greek terms, "aion" and "aionion", which do not denote "eternity" or "eternal" as is often thought when it comes to verses like Matthew 25:46.  His INTERPRETATION of "Hell", while 10,000 times more merciful than the "Hellfire and Damnation" notion, is still unscriptural and a misinterpretation.  "Hell" is actually derived from the Anglo-Saxon "Hel", meaning "hole" or "hidden place", hardly the kind of words that would bring up visualizations of "torment".    Copan proves that when you are possessed by the obsession to "win, win, win arguments against those good-for-nothing non-Christians", you start to pour out nonsense like this.  "Apologetics" seems to take on the characteristics of a fistfight rather than a search for the deeper and abiding knowledge and wisdom of God.  Copan simply joins the ever-growing list of legalistic apologists who seem, if you'll excuse the expression, "Hell"-bent on BEING RIGHT AT ALL COSTS 
 I got this book for my son when we got to the point that he had so many questions (technical in nature) that I couldn't remember the exact answer to (or don't know, not being a boy). I turned to my male friends for help, and one recommended "The Guy Book," which he had given to his  5 boys and they liked a lot. My son loved  it. It has a lot of info on boys, their bodies, their issues with friends,  and such necessary details as how to buy a corsage and tie a tie. My son asked intelligent questions, sparked by the book, and has read bits of it over and over.  The book is laid out in a non-threatening way, with fun illustrations and enough silly entries that it draws the reader in so that when they get to potentially embarassing material they just keep on going. It's also divided up so that, like the car repair manual it emulates, you can dip in to the one specific piece of info you need and then put it down until later.  Because of his interest, I've given this book to my nephews and recommended it to friends with pre-teens. Some of my nieces found it really useful, too, because it explains a lot about how and why boys do certain things.   I recommend this especially to parents who have trouble talking to their kids beyond a certain age, or single moms who, like me, just don't know the right answer. (If you don't know the answers, I recommend you read it. Then you'll know what you need to know to answer the next set of questions.)  The only thing wrong with this book is that I didn't write it. ;- 
 Arthur Phillips created an awesome plot for his novel, but trying to read it at times was like pulling teeth. Normally once I pick a book up I can't bring myself to put it down... this book however, i couldn't bring myself to keep reading even whe i was bedridden for three days with nothing else to do.  The theory behind this plot was amazing, but the story-line was way too convoluted, and the huge twist was entirely too predictable. I physically reading a book and flipping back and forth between chapters, but the only way I could finish this novel was by listening to the audio book 
 Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, "Yeah! yeah! That's me!" and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, "No duh!" I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. "Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!" Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 The quality of these dress up clothes was not at all what I expected.  The clothes were tiny - too small for my neice for whom I bought the gift.  She is three years old, and really petit.  All of the shirts were like tankini tops on her.  Also, the fabrics were cheap looking and feeling, and the construction of the outfits was disappointing 
 AGAIN I TOOK A CHANCE & BOUGHT A DVD WITHOUT FIRST HAVING SEEN IT. ITS' SUBJECT--A YOUNG MANS' SAME-SEX ESCAPADES ABOUT TOWN IN LISBON, PORTUGAL--SEEMS QUITE PROVOCATIVE WHEN BUYING A FILM. I MUST SAY ITS MAIN CHARACTER--SERGIO--WAS A DELIGHT TO WATCH & A GREAT CHOICE FOR THIS FILM AS HE POSSESSES THAT "BRANDOESQUE", UNTAMED SEX-APPEAL THAT CAN'T BE TAUGHT OR LEARNED. THE WAY HE SUCCUMBED TO HIS SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES WITH SUCH SELF-ABANDON WAS TRULY BELIEVABLE IF NOT RISQUE & DISTURBING. THE FILM STARTS OUT WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE SOME FORM OF S&M & PROGRESSES TO ANONYMOUS SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS IN A CAR & A PUBLIC RESTROOM. MIND YOU, THESE ENCOUNTERS ARE STRICTLY CARNAL & DEVOID OF ANY IDEALIZATION OF SEXUALITY ITSELF. ALL THE WHILE, SERGIO  MADLY OBSESSES OVER A DUDE THAT FINDS HIS STALKING BEHAVIOR ANNOYING AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE. THIS DOESN'T DETER SERGIO AS HE PROCEEDS DEEPER INTO HIS SEXUAL DILEMMA. THE GUY BECOMES A "PHANTOM" IN SERGIOS' PSYCHE; THE MORE HE AVOIDS & REFUSES SERGIOS' ADVANCES, THE DEEPER SERGIO FALLS INTO HIS SELF-CREATED ABYSS.  THE OVERALL SCENERY OF THE FILM IS DARK & DESOLATE WHICH HELPED TO ISOLATE & AMPLIFY SERGIOS' TROUBLED STATE OF MIND. OVERALL, THE FILM WAS NOT ALL BAD BUT "TOO MUCH & NOT ENOUGH".  KUDOS TO RICARDO MENESES ON HIS DEBUT; HE ALONE MADE THIS FILM MEMORABLE 
 I ordered two of these microsuede comforters; one in green and the other in brown. I was disappopinted in both. The comforter is not plump enough to add richness to the style. Tufting can barely be seen. I ordered queen sizes, but they seemed more like full. Maybe if I had ordered the king size I would have been more satisfied 
 Raymond Feist likes to take his time developing a story, that's for sure. Just like his other series, Feist takes a pretty good idea and drags out the climax for well over a 1000 pages. I liked the concept started in the first book and even appreciated the character development carried into the second in the series. However, by the third book I was was saying to myself, "Please get on with it!" As I step back and look, nothing but character development happened in the the first thousand or so pages. A couple minor adventures and the retrieval of several old characters from Midkemia's past prepare us for a major conflict that still has not become clear. I wish I could give this a higher rating because the ideas and twists are respectable. However, this could have been a two book series and given the reader a lot richer and faster paced diversion. 
 I was halfway through this book and wanted to throw it against the wall,  it was that bad.  I have read her works before, and they were very good --  but not this one.  It was not scary at all.  The heroine was very  unlikeable--in fact everyone was.  I was definitely very disappointed in  this book 
 They call themselves now proudly "The American Led Zeppelin", I wish it could be. 35 years after their true onforgettable albums "Cactus", "One Way ...or Another" and "Restrictions", which indeed come close to the first 2 L.Z. albums I and II and are at times slightly reminiscent of III and IV, the same band minus leadsinger Rrusty Day (who has long since gone and lives now in a better world, I hope) ressurects from the grave but better had not done so. The new songmaterial is flat, so is the new singers voice. But then, who can stand in the shadow of Day? But besides that, not a moment I have the idea of listening to the remarkable rythmtandem, formerly of Vanilla Fudge, later among others Beck Bogert Appice, of bassplayer Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice, let alone leadguitarist par excellence Jim McCarty. At that time he used a simple two knob device "the screamer" and got the hell out of his Les Paul and small ampstack. The music was intense and loud! Of course, times change, tastes too and those people are not the youngest anymore, you  cannot compare their deeds nowadays with those of three and half decade before, but one wonders why should they take the trouble to make an album under the Cactus flag. No single song can stand against one on the mentioned classic albums. The acoustic guitar instrumental "Blues for mr. Day" is strongly reminiscent of "Mean Night in Cleveland" and as such a poor tribute to their excellent leadvocalist.  Jim Kunes as singer should not have been first choice (but instead Paul Rodgers of Free and Bad Company, who now teams up with Queen), his voice is simple too flat and not in the least comparible with that of the late mr. Day. That is not strictly necessary of course but the endresult is not promising. Like I said, the songs are not the strongest either. Bogert and Appice can do much much better than that, for instance take a listen to "DBA", from which the D stands for Rick Derringer, just a couple of years back. The songs on that album are not only stronger, much more in the vein of the earlier work, but also more varied. Well, the world is not disengrating with this new album and happily I will return to my roots with the really outstanding Cactus 2 CD "Barely Contained - the Studio Sessions" [5 stars for that].      
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 I'll admit, I have never looked at this book, but Michael Sullivan's other Trigonometry book is very bad. No specific exampels, vauge explanations. If this book is anything like his old one, dont get it!! 
 As others have said, it's really a shame that you can't rate the film and the DVD seperately.  I didn't buy this sooner because of the closed captioning.  I had read that the problem is fixed, but I just got mine, and it's not.  I don't even want a dub.  I prefer subtitles, but these are ridiculous for those of us who can hear - quite obtrusive.  The film's Wikipedia article claims that "after receiving numerous complaints, DreamWorks released a statement saying that unsatisfied customers could exchange their DVDs for properly subtitled ones, postage paid; and that version 4 already had the proper subtitling."  The link no longer works, and if I can't get it replaced, I'll either sell this or get a partial refund 
 what does the song mean??? Inside Your Heaven??? sorry 1 sta 
 This phone is lovely to look at BUT... 1. The numbers on the touch pad wore off within 6 months. 2. The touchpad completely ceased to function within three years of very light use.( it was a second phone used maybe 1- 4 times a week) 3.  The receiver cord is EXTREMELY short.  
 I would not recommend this book to non-Greeks or people who are not familiar with Greek cooking (like myself).  Some of the recipes seem to leave out important information - like how to prepare the vegetables before cooking - which might be obvious to a more experienced Greek cook.  Also, some of the recipes are good and others a sort of blah.  Although maybe this is because it is hard to get really fresh produce year round in the NE US - unlike in Greece.  I do like how the book is organized into menus 
 The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai 
 But I'm just very frustrated in the comparisons between Saddam and Osama.  Though Darryl doesn't mention the relation, he released this on the eve of the Iraq war, and "this war" refers to Iraq--and I've never met anyone, ANYONE, who said "Awww, forget 'bin Laden!"  This song is about Saddam.  But though Saddam was (is) nuts, he wasn't stupid.  He wanted to keep his power, not do dumb stuff to rile up outsiders.  Al Qaeda in Iraq didn't really even exist before the invasion, and now they are a strong force there.  I feel the invasion has TAKEN AWAY from the real fight on terrorism--we're so bogged down there, we can't put our full efforts into thwarting terror plots and encouraging moderates to be on our side--there is a PR campaign to be fought, folks--you can't (well, I guess you CAN) just bomb everything in sight.  Most of our enemies in Iraq (even 'Al Qaeda' there) don't give two craps about Osama (btw I first wrote Saddam there--it does get confusing!), they just feel their country was invaded--kind of like how the Michigan Militia would react here.  The admistration disrupted the world and divided our nation.  United we stand, indeed.    And though I haven't listened to the album, this has exactly FOUR new songs.  Tell me that's not opportunism.  So no, Darryl, I have not forgotten the day when I saw thousands die when our two towers were destroyed, but I'm afraid you have, in the way you've replaced Osama bin Laden with Saddam Hussein 
 I must agree with the previous reviewer, who found this CD 'lacking in grandeur'. The vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered, and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written. But they are curiously lightweight, and I felt like I was listening to musical fluff. "Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring"--in my opinion, the most moving of all the cantatas--was far too fast-paced: it sounded distressingly like the Minute Waltz. "Sleepers Awake" received similar treatment. Professionally, all of the performers on this CD undoubtedly delivered, but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that Bach's cantatas can evoke 
 i adore le creuset, but this tea kettle was a monumental disappointment. as other reviewers have noted, it rusted within months of purchasing it. (however, i admittedly had no problems with burns from the handle or removing the whistle to pour.) i can't imagine what a person would need to do in order to prevent the rusting, aside from never actually using the kettle. i was seriously let down by this purchase, since it looked so beautiful but ended up being so useless 
 Pro: Book taught me about the necessary things I needed to build my pc.  Con: The book basically told you about the products that they are selling. I don't like the fact that they limit it to those products and wanted to learn about other products that were available 
 The most memorable part of this film was the dance scene to "Night Life" which would repeat through the movie.  This version credits the song, but it was replaced with some lame disco music. I am writing MGM to complain and demand a refund.  Even the trailer has the right music playing all through it.  Demand the original 
 To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book.  The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing.  I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like "Snow Crash", but "Synners" is just strange.  Ala the Emperor's New Clothes..."Oh my, how strange!  It must be good!"  No, sorry, it's just strange.  I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it.  I thought I might read farther if I understood it better.  I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it. Dou 
 While this book provides a lot of technical information it was written over seven years ago.  The information provided is practically ancient in the high tech and ever changing world of IVF.  The author is very dry, clinical and frankly quite negative about the chances of success.  Again, this is due to the age of the book.  IVF success rates have increased dramatically since this book was published.  A much better, positive, timely and accurate book is The Couples Guide to IVF.  It was written in this century and it much more helpful, upbeat and informative.  
 I find it down right scary that this book is taken so seriously as demonstrated by the reviews at Amazon. Let me say from the outset, I agree whole heartedly with Hammes's premise. The DoD is not now and seems to have little interest in fighting the wars we are likely to have to fight in the next 25 years.  At least that is how it appears to an outsider. The problem is that Hammes then goes off in a long dissertation of muddleheaded thinking and analysis that tries to connect things that have no relevancy and missing the important points entirely. He further demonstrates his ignorance with factual inaccuracies in an effort to support his ideas. Here are just a couple of examples. He claims that his versions of warfare were only possible after various economic, political, and social developments took place. He demonstrated this, in the case of 2GW, with a comparison of Waterloo in 1815 where 200,000 troops were involved to Agincourt in 1415 where only 31,000 troops took part thus showing how development had allowed larger armies to take the field. Is he for real? Has he read any military history? What about Darius who faced Alexander with 134,000 to 47,000 in 331BC. How about Hannibal against the Romans at Cannae with a total of 130,000 troops in 216BC, or Genghis Kahn who led 180,000 troops against a Chinese army of 500,000. Here is another example; he dates 4GW to Mao in the 30's. Has he read Mao, who himself wrote about the origins as much earlier, particularly the Russians against Napoleon. Our own language betrays his ignorance, where does he think words like vandal, thug, and assassin came from? He goes on to dismiss what he calls 3GW which he mistakenly equates with maneuver warfare. He never mentions the most important development in military thinking in the last 50 years, the work of Col. John Boyd and associates. No where does he describe the Boyd cycle or OODA loop. He does say that international terrorist have the upper hand, "At the stratgitic level the combination of our perceived technological superiority and our bureaucratic organizations set us up for a major failure against a more agile and intellectually prepared enemy". This Col. Hammes is exactly what is called being inside your opponent's OODA loop, and that is the problem we must solve. All the rhetoric about evolution, 1GW, 2GW, 3GW, and 4GW. The long dissertation on social, political, and economic development are irrelevant. What is relevant is to figure out how we can get inside their OODA loop before they are able to exploit their current advantage. Admittedly not an easy thing to do but certainly not helped by mudding the water as Hammes has done with this book. If you are unfamiliar with the OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop get the episode of the TV series "Legends of Airpower" and read "Certain to Win" by Chet Richards, or go to the man himself, Boyd's works are available on the net. 
 Some nice examples of jewelry to make, but not as much detail as I expected 
 This Book belabors the obvious and is very light on detail oriented, usable information.  General overview is good, but you can tell that this person does not have any hands on experience with the subject matter 
 I'm an agronomist and I read this trash-book, here in Brazil. This book , as a tipical pseudo-historic book, puts some real things.Even with some real things, all are used as a cover to frauds and bigoted anti-catholic absurds. A tipical anti-catholic absurd is the claim in this book, that Pius XII was a racist, using the "fact" that this Pope claimed that any "Black" american soldier in Rome, because Pius XII "thought" they were rapers. Nonsense.The real allied troop full of rapers and in Italy, wasn't a black american division.It was really an arabian troop serving the De Gaulle's "Free France".This trash-book "forgets" the fact and invent an anti-catholic fraud. In fact, Pius XII was an eugenics' foe. The opposite was true among famous protestants and jews, at that times. During the civil rights fights in USA, during 1950 decade, Pius XII showed that he was against eugenics/racism again. This trash book draws an absurd and never existed Pius XII. Who gave power to Hitler were eugenicists and communists. Pius XII ever was a Hitler's foe 
 Out of date. Out of date. Out of date. This book was published in 1987 with no updates. Whey, as the primary protein supplement didnt even exist at the time. Half the book is recipes. If thats what your looking for then by all means purchase it. If your looking for a diet strategy based current knowledge then look elsewhere 
 Black Moses was first published nearly 50 years ago.  It was based on a masters thesis and for years was the only book available on Marcus Garvey.  Since the 1970s several new books on Garvey have appeared, most notably Race First by Tony Martin.  These more recent books are much better researched and incorporate a lot of new sources that Cronon was unaware of or did not have access to.  These include Garvey's newspaper, the Negro World and various governmenrt records in the US National Archives. It simply is no longer possible to get a really accurate view of Marcus Garvey from Cronon's now woefully out of date work.  It served its purpose but should now give way to better books 
 I really expected more out of this book, it was a disappointment.  If you have no idea about property management then this book is probably good.  If you are already in the business, it's probably not all that helpful.  I expected more details and this was an overview 
 This was the required book for the Databases class at the University of Utah Computer Science department. It is a good book if you want to learn the theory behind databases. If you want to actually learn about practical information then pickup "The Practical SQL Handbook" by Bowman and others.  Also note that the E-R diagrams Silberschatz uses is not widely used. I found the book to be poorly written. Buy this book only if you need it for school 
 I bought this book looking for simple ways to bring my daughter into the Catholic faith. Not only was I disappointed, I was enraged in some places.  The author believes people should have altars in thier homes and complete blinding obedience to the faith.  If you live like the author expects you to, then you don't need this book.  If you live like most Catholics do, find another book, because this book is only for those with extreme versions of what it means to be Catholic 
 One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had.  TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional.  I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year.  Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H&R by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0 
 The unit was 20ft from the receiver, in the same room, in direct view of eachother...Tivo wouldn't connect 
 I bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for Christmas, mostly because it was the only way to get the Breezie "Zipzee" (one of the main Breezies in the new movies). Thank goodness I wasn't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets, because it didn't even last a day! After I assembled the "braiding" handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched. The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw it away only hours after opening the box.  So, unless you're really after Zipzee or Daffidaisy, don't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings. Horrible!! 
 Simply put, this was an awful disappointment. James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed 
 Unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets.  Spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments.  This is not always practical.  The tripod mount fits too loose on Spyder and easily falls off.  I think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product, but not yet ready for prime time 
 This is one of the most boring books I have ever read 
 I just spent a week in Key West and found this book to be surprisingly useless. There are unnecessary negative comments in many of the reviews, even in places she likes. There is a negative thread running through the majority of the book.  I cannot recommend this book for any reason. Fortunately we had another guide book which was very helpful 
 This book sucks..........Schwartz is impossible to read!  I tried to read The Living Energy Universe, and the Afterlife Experiments, which I could not finish....when a friend gave me the TRUTH to read I thought it would be lighter and more fun, but I was wrong, I could not finish it either.  Schwartz is definitely not a writer 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 I liked his first the best, I never liked this CD much. The new one "awake" is even worse 
 The first few times I saw this film, I thought it was great.  The use of music, the color, the sets, I thought they were all wonderful.  Then I saw films by the directors Anderson was copying.  Now, immitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this is prevelant in the Coen brothers' first 8 films, but Anderons just relies on the ideas of others, hoping people will buy them as his own.  The use of color-Kubrick The seemingly lifeless character-Name a french new wave director, you got it The use of music-Jarmusch  So, all in all, this is basically Anderon's "hey, look at the directors I like, and watch me try to copy them." film 
 Zizek's failed encounter with Deleuze will prove to haunt him since Deleuze and Guattari provded a framework to get outside of Lacan which Zizek still remains embedded in completely.  I should say from the start, Zizek is absolutely brilliant, but his slip ups are all too numerous and his hasty publication of books have created an unendurable repetition of content. There are content problems with the book and style problems, as many of the previous reviewers have truthfully attested to.  But even the 100 or so pages on Deleuze are wrought with references to movies and books (and sometimes the occasional refreshing joke), but all in all, the book probably amounts to 30-40 real pages of thorough critique.  The problem is that Zizek prepares books by writing books, and in reading the most recent big work - "The Parallax Gap" (which Zizek calls his most important work), one sees that the books of the previous 4 years were a type of movement towards this.    First I how those interested in Zizek might go about critiquing Deleuze which is coupled with recommendations for Zizek's other works.  After that I will recommend an alternative route to people interested in a crtique of Deleuze (outside of those made in other reviews - such as "Deleuze: A Critical Reader")  If you want to get an idea of how to critique Deleuze through Zizek, I recommend reading Lacan very closely, and critiquing Deleuze through Lacan.  But if Lacan is intractable for you, Zizek is a helpful guide to realize Lacan's contributions.  I would even hasten to add that if one is unfamiliar with Lacan, one cannot account for the weaknesses and strengths of a text like anti-oedipus (which has the capacity to perform the same reduction on lacan).  If one were to buy a book on Zizek, I think the least scatterbrained and most theoretical (Hegelian) is "For they know not what they do" but be sure to get the second edition with the very long preface (80 pgs) which reconfigures his position now with regard to his previous work.  Organs without bodies is important to see how Zizek directly comprehends Deleuze's work (and at times, he reposes problems in interesting directions), but it will probably piss alot of Deleuzians off, and  not because his critiques are right on, but because he has hardly payed attention to the unique elements of Deleuze's philosophy (which is to say, he critiques Deleuze as if he would critique any positive thinker, without exploring in depth, the complexity of his system).    Zizek is most interesting for his Lacanian reading of Hegel, which is quite good, and very interesting.  His main (hegelian) idea is that the ontological or the transcendental is created from the failure to fully represent the real.  In Deleuzian terms, Zizek would say that the virtual is created from the inconsistency of the actual, which we then generalize into the virtual.  Therefore, Deleuze's claims to "think without an image" are undoubtedly a way to make the reader forget Deleuze's own positioning (which is mainly from Nietzsche).  And yes, for those of you who bash Hegel without ever having even read him, Deleuze is extremely close to Hegel in many ways, and if you don't understand how they are alike and different you don't really understand the problems either of them face.  But Zizek treats this proximity as if it was an attack (which merely just calls into question Deleuze's own aversion to Hegel which does betray a proximity).  This is immature, but perhaps is only as immature as Deleuze's aversion to Hegel.  [But Deleuze never wrote a critique of Hegel in this fashion! As Zizek ahs done with Deleuze].  But Zizek did make me pay attention to key passages that I did not before, which accent the transcendental nature of Deleuze's empiricism.  Zizek's own failure to critique Deleuze made me question my own (as other readers have) deification of Deleuze. I began to ask why Does Deleuze call his system "Transcendental Empiricism" if he destroys transcendence at every turn in favor of immanence?  The answer is that Deleuze is situated in the transcendental turn in philosophy which reconcieves as the transcendental not the noumenal thing in itself (as in Kant), but rather the situation in which the noumenal and the phenomenal are limits [as in Heiddeger, Husserl, Lacan, and Merleu-Ponty](recall the passage in A thousand Plateaus that the body without organs is a limit).  What this means is that Deleuze's concept of Difference cannot be concieved as something apart from the situation of the human being which does not have access to all of reality (recall Deleuze's claim that "Difference is not diversity, diversity is given, Difference is by which the given is given")  This "by which" as Difference (and Derrida's Differance) makes Deleuze's immanence very problematic since this "middle" area is still human.  The real problem is whether the structure of consciousness (expressionism) can be extended to the world "Everything is consciousness because it possesses a double" (Difference and Repetition, 220).  This question is always the question they come back to, and it is the shakiest component of Deleuze's system.  It is also the component that needs to be confronted via lacan, which unfortunately Zizek fails to do in a systematic way.  Plus he writes the book After Deleuze dies, when Zizek had active engagement with his ideas very early on.  If anything, it is good to convince oneself that one is questioning one's own idols.  If you want a breath of fresh air in philosophy, I recommend the books: "Contingency, Hegemony, Universality" which contains a dialog between Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler, and Slavoj Zizek (he doesn't make stupid references every 5 seconds in this book).  I also Recommend any book by Renaud Barbaras ("Desire and Distance" might be an extremely interesting counterpoint to Deleuze).  Another book - "Naturalizing Phenomenology" is an essential book that deals with what Zizek does badly, how consciousness studies and cognitive studies contribute to these contemporary thinkers.   Whatever you decide, it is true that Zizek's critique is essential to understand in order to truly understand Deleuze's strengths and weaknesses, whether you get it from this book or others.  If you can remain Deleuzian and take Lacanians seriously, you can only then call yourself Deleuzian 
 After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their "font patch", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H&R Block has lost this customer. 
 If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed.  It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books 
 I studied the topic of consciousness for a biopsychology course, and this book served as my main resource. I enjoyed Damasio's model of consciousness, but it was a painful read. He regularly uses ineffective analogies to classical music and other high-brow topics. Worse, he stretches the information out over 400 pages, despite having written a 25-page review article on the very same subjects. Save yourself a lot of time, and just read that article:  Parvizi J., Damasio A. Consciousness and the brainstem (2001) Cognition, 79 (1-2), pp. 135-160 
 Sorry, I was disappointed because I thought I had ordered the book itself 
 But yes, Brooks and Dunn are getting worse.  They lost me as a fan with Steers and Stripes and I haven't heard anything on this album to win me back 
 I read the entirety of this book to learn and understand the Armenian claims. Although the language and the depictions in the book don't seem to be quiet objective as you'd expect from a true historian, I do understand why the author has such a style; After all, his studies and expenses in US are all paid by certain diaspora members and private institutes...But anyway I think as the citizens of today's modern Armenia and Turkey, we should stop focusing on the question of "is it a genocide or not?" but look at the future. I know hardliners keep saying that one should accept the history and come clean etc.. before anything else but i think such an expectation is not only needless but also another tag line of today's Entente Powers to keep both Turkey and Armenia occupied with these endless historical debates and derail these two countries future economic prosperity. I'd like to thank Mr.Akcam that he clearly points out that the indigenous Armenians and Turks of Anatolia killed each other in mass back in those years due to the fierce political ploys of European Countries; primarily France, England and Russia. They all wanted to take a piece of the Anatolia pie; home for Turks, Armenians, Kurds and all.  Back in those days, the only and ultimate method of controlling other nations and continents for one's own imperial lust was to bog them down in politics, war, massacres, finger pointing and push these weaker countries or local populations against each other as in the example of Armenians and Turks.  Yet life has changed significantly in today's technology age. A country's success is not measured by it's territorial wingspan but more with its technology capital, established structure of finance sector, adaptability to new technologies and global trends. UK,Italy, Germany and the Nordic countries have successfully made this transition within the past decades, hence they do not deal with crazy political complo theories and animosity ploys for other developing nations. However, France failed with a D in that class; they missed the technology, innovation and finance train that has been touring around the globe. They were left out with "wine and dine" leadership of the world which obviously doesn't make much money in global perspective. Hence, they keep resorting to the old political games which include pushing Armenians and Turks against each other for dog fight so that they can benefit from it. The latest evidence of this is their attempt to create a law to punish denying Armenian massacres...They knew Turks would react to this, but they knowingly pushed for it because they don't have anything better to do in today's technology century.  As a younger generation member of Turkey, I'd like to work with my Armenian brothers and sisters to bring prosperity to both nations. Regardless of what happened between us a century ago, I think this is what the two countries need; economic prosperity so that they won't be tools to other imperialist countries like France ever again in the future. The 4 million people of Armenia and 70 million people of Turkey should go hand in hand and work with each other, create more trade and partnerships.  I wish Mr.Akcam's book ended with such a note asking for more cooperation between the two countries instead of who did what? At the end of the day, no Turkish government will ever accept genocide, and no Armenian government will ever stop asking for it. So, why bother? let's just focus on the future and bring prosperity to our future generations so that they don't have to go thru bloodshed ever again 
 Jack R. Meredith and Samuel J. Mantel, Jr. have written an academic reference book about project management that is at times dry, theoretical, and boring to read. However, their book is at other times a good, interesting reflection tool for an experienced project manager. A green project manager will often have difficulty to relate the content of the book to his/her new practice. Based on my own experience, there is ultimately no better learning school than getting his/her hands "dirty" in the field under the supervision of an experienced project manager to learn the ropes of the job 
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here.  The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again?     I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.       Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. "Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.   I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it.     This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to "not enough time to fix" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this.  
 The bedlams that greet the current Republican Administration each morning for USA `involvement in Iraq' have actually relegated this DVD to second-rate. It is obvious that the producers of this so called `Documentary' are more likely to be fractious to Mr. Bush in particular than accommodating to the American public at large. It is also obvious that Mr Bush is not the type of person to succumb to self-pity. Mr Moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though.  In the meantime I can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind 9/11 to unfold.   
  I had a bit of trouble rating this one; I was tempted to give it a three but ultimately was forced to decide on a 2. If Amazon offered a 2 1/2 choice, I would have used it.  Don't get me wrong - I didn't dislike this book. It had it's good points but the negatives couldn't allow me to give it a 3 as an average rating. For the positive side of things, this book is massive, pretty, well organized, and written in a simple to understand manner.   It's from the staff of Herbs for health, which includes many herbalists that are recommendable such as Christopher Hobbs. The main author of this book is Linda B. White, M.D., followed by Steven Foster. While I commend Ms. White for writing herbals and having an M.D. at the same time  - we need more physicians taking alternate healing seriously - I felt the book was a bit too cautious and at time allopathic orientated.   Within every condition, there lay herbal recommendations....with prescription drug names and uses. In fact, drug names are listed first :( If this is a book on healing and herbs and natural remedies, why does it have to again share its pedestal? And even worse, be placed second when the book is supposed to be about it in the first place? If this Herbal Drugstore is supposed to be the options to prescriptions and over the counter drugs, then why list them so often in every section with details? At least their side effects are listed, which makes them appear a bit frightening in comparison. For those who really do want to know the name of each prescription drug used to treat asthma, angina, or any other condition, then here you'll find it.  Steven Foster was the co-writer for Tyler's honest herbal, which is an oxymoron if I ever heard one. Tyler's honest herbal remains one of the most hated books of the herbal profession, and for good reason. Fosters contribution there may also have been too cautious, although one isn't sure how much he really had to do with it. I am surprised someone who devotes so much time to herbs and even a magazine about them is so overly cautious, but that seems to be the current trend.  I did greatly appreciate some sections such as "How Herbs are Regulated" and common herb/drug interactions. The former is an interesting addition that's not seen enough, and was told honestly. There is a great simple reference guide at the beginning in a table where a condition is named, then commonly used drugs, then the herbal alternatives beside them.   The section on conditions is extensive enough and does offer more recommendations than herbs, as well as the occassional cool remedy/formula. Many of these seem like decent to good blends, particularly blister balm, Endometriosis Tea, and Swimmer's Ear Drops. Typical dosage is given for each herb, including teas or pills or tinctures, which is welcome.   The final  half wraps up with very short comments on herbs, basically stating uses without complete sentences as a quick reference to herbs already covered elsewhere in the book. After these are the typical references and resources.  Overall this book is not bad but it's just so plain in terms of natural therapy. It's for the basic, basic lay person who only has a passing interest in herbal therapies. Here they're treated almost like little drugs beside other drugs, as alternatives, and no mention really on other herbal uses, as in holistic healing, etc. Diet is mentioned at times, and this is appreciated, but everything is so cautionary as seems to be found with these kinds of  books lately.  Because of this, it can only be granted a low score. Not enough information per condition, with drugs listed FIRST, then herbs, and not much info on the herbs either. Too cautionary and medical minded to be a highly recommended herbal, but alright for the passerby who just wants to take a look 
 This book, like many Benford offerings seems to mistake confusion for art. The story line is weak and development is weak. Benford is, I'm sure a brilliant physicist, and my recommendation is that he stay with his day job 
      In his most recent attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the Da Vinci Code, Bart Ehrman presents Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene.  Most of the Amazon reviewers of the book seem unaware that the book is a skillfully disguised anti-Christian polemic--in the Tubingen tradition--which is based upon a number of historically and philosophically flawed assumptions.  I mention this at the outset because so many reviewers continue to praise Ehrman for his objective historical scholarship and lack of theological bias.  This is laughable.  He is about as theologically unbiased as John Gager, Elaine Pagels, and the other post-Protestant, anti-Christians of the PTS.       In this book, Ehrman very craftily juxtaposes a number of late second century Gnostical texts with passages from the Acts of the Apostles in an attempt to convince people that the Acts were fictional, legendary accounts of Peter and Paul, devised for theological purposes by non-witnesses of the late first or early second century.  This Tubingen theory has been thoroughly debunked for years.  Can Ehrman please explain to his agnostical cheerleaders why the historical data in the Acts ends abruptly in 62 A.D. with Paul's two year imprisonment in Rome?  Why does Luke not mention anything about Nero or the Neronian persecution in the Acts?  How does Luke--as a non-witness--give such a detailed description of Paul's shipwreck near Crete, and why does Paul specifically mention Luke as a travel companion in his epistles of the late 40's?  In short, what sound historical evidence does Ehrman present to support his central assertion that Luke did not write the Acts as a sequel to his Gospel prior to 70 A.D.?         This brings us to the next, central Ehrman-Tubingen assumption: positivism. F.C. Baur and the positivists of the Tubingen school simply assumed that Luke's gospel had to be written after 70 A.D. because it couldn't possibly have prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem.  Big assumption!  No possibility of prophesy, the supernatural, or other spiritual phenomena in the cosmos.  The problem, of course, is that positivism is, itself, taken on faith, and it is the "faith" of Mr. Ehrman, his own theological bias.  Like John Gager, Ehrman is trying, with very dubious analytic success, to make sense of spiritual phenomena using positivistic assumptions.  He is forced to assume that the witness of the "Seventy"--including Luke, the obvious author of the Acts-- was fictional.  Hence, Ehrman's second most basic assumption is that the Hebrew standard for verifying the truth--the testimony of two or more witnesses--is simply erroneous.  Big assumption!      Finally, Ehrman demonstrates in this book a complete lack of knowledge of the mystical theology and praxis of the Orthodox Church.  He attributes the "gospel of asceticism" to Paul, forgetting entirely--if he ever knew it-- the Sermon on the Mount and other explicit teachings of Christ on fasting, prayer, overcoming anger, etc.  He later pontificates about the definitive "passion" of the Orthodox in contrast to the otherworldly asceticism of the Gnostics.  Absolute nonsense!  A central focus of Orthodox Christian spirituality is the development of dispassion and detachment from the material world.  He should study the Apothegmata Patrum, and I should stop reading Ehrman.  His errors inspire too much passion in me!         
 Garbage - don't bother to buy or read this 
 I really don't like this high chair at all. My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly. Don't buy this product! 
 The reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best, so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [I might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured (and no longer airborne) housefly buzzing in circles]. With respect to the heat(ing), it does perform better, but is by no means stellar.   The Pro's are its design for moisture, a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off.   The Con's include, as others have said, a HUGE AC-DC plug/power pack, no apparent ability to WASH the darn thing, only modest heat, annoying Velcro straps, a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together, but can't be removed from the main pad for washing AND, perhaps most significantly, the fact that mine died after approx. 18 months (which, incidentally, raises yet another detractor; the Warranty is only a year, much less than many other brands) 
 What a gimmick. Its nothing but Pure alcohol. I should have looked at the ingreidents list. I should have bought princereigns or min, but I bought into all those phony reviews below 
 The recipes are fine, but the book does not contain an index or a table of contents.  Recipes are organized by time of day you might want to make them.  If you read cookbooks cover to cover then you'll be ok.  The only way to find a recipe is to flip through every page in the book.  
 As can be judged by the positive reviews given to this book, Shahak had played into the hands of anti-Semites and pseudo-scholars alike - if it wasn't his intent for writing this book in the first place.  Amongst a great number of other instances of intentionally concealed anti-Semitic attacks masquerading as an instance of objective analysis are:   *Claiming that Maimonides was an anti-black racist.  Shahak deliberately fails to mention the fact that NOT holding racist views of the black race was a very rare occurance in the 12th century Europe and Asia amongst ALL ranks of society.  *Claiming that Jews permit adult sexual relations with minors.  This is a very popular slander amongst anti-Semites used against Jews; needless to say, this is a completely false allegation that has no grounds in the Talmud.  Actually, the Talmud discusses whether the victim of such activity, which is expressly FORBIDDEN by Judaism, should be considered virgin at the time of their marriage.  *Claiming that the Talmud treats gentiles abusively and providing passages from Talmud as evidence.  Shahak, like all other anti-Semites in disguise, fails to mention that such laws were originated by gentiles, and officialy vindicated by European law, AGAINST the Jews living in Europe, who then adopted similar laws to vindicate themselves.  Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.  Apparently, Europeans used Christianity's teachings to live an ascetic life as an excuse to cover up their jealousy of Jewish success and endlessly persecute them.  I could go on exposing Shahak for who he really is, but I simply don't need to, as I expect and hope that these three examples will suffice to convince any potential reader of this book that its content is neither objective nor productive to expanding your view of the Jewish faith as it really is. 
 About 2 years ago an article was written in Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine titled 'The future of commercial travel is on smaller aircraft.'  What started out as an enjoyable read, turned disturbing as every issue Fallows raised was covered in that original article 
 I have been a loyal Sony product user for over 30 years.  However, their Compact Disc Recorder RCD-W500C/W100 is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that I have ever seen.  It reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech- incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone's tastes.  For instance, why does it need a remote?  How many people will be cutting CDs from their easy chairs?  I have a call in to two friends who I hope can rescue me from my dilemma 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 I love batman, but this version of batman is by far the worst version ever created (including all the live action, animation, or comic book versions of batman).  I have no clue why they are wasting animation resourses on a crap cartoon like this, when they could be putting it toward quality cartoons like Justice League.  Warner Bros. needs to get a clue.  I might not be a kid anymore (I'm the ripe old age of 21), but if I ever have kids I can promise you they will not be allowed to watch this.  They will be watching all of the Batman the animated series dvds that I bought last month.  Please parents (and kids) go buy those dvds (or superman the animated series, or justice league, or batman beyond, or x-men, or even teen titans) instead of wasting your money on this crapola 
 Phaeton's son flew On wings of wax into sun Crashed and burned instea 
 While the subject matter was good, the writing style was lacking.  Plus, I don't think she applies the same level of high-mindedness to herself as she does to other people.  She seems to like to cut down trees but then complains later about flooding from upgradient homeowners that have cut down their trees.  Also, she drowns possums.  She complains that she raises her food to live on and she can't spare any to varmints.  I'm not sure what she thinks the possum was eating the food for.  I suspect to live on.  And some of her arguments don't hold water.  Like the vegetarian argument mentioned earlier.  THis book could have used better editing.  
 This book would not be helpful for children of faiths other than Christianity 
 Results makes a solid case for building blocks that a good Business 101 textbook would tell you make up a company's likelihood for success, but Results misses the mark on identifying or leveraging company personalities.     The term `company personality' is misused.  Instead of a company 'personality', the authors appear to be more accurately describing the maturity or efficacy of a company ~ which is a VERY different realm.  Said another way, the survey tool (and the book) do not describe a company's personality, they describe a company's level of dysfunction.   Results illustrates a preferred end of the efficacy spectrum labeled Healthy in which companies are said to have mature capacities for what we know are best practices for decisions, org charts, metrics, and performance infrastructure.   On the Unhealthy end are companies that have not developed similar capacities.   Results would then have us believe that all companies should aspire to become the same personality.  Herein lies the misnomer of the term `personality'.  The Healthy-Unhealthy spectrum of dysfunction offers a simplistic explanation of what makes a company 'work', but it is only two-dimensional.   A company's personality is THREE dimensional.   A company's personality is also founded on its core values, core beliefs, signal behaviors, its attitudes, and its vision.     If you are looking to leverage success through understanding your company's personality, read Companies are People, Too (Fekete, 2003) instead.  This book (and tool set) offer a well rounded approach to understanding company personalities and provides a way for all company personalities to have their place - and still be successful!   Intuitively, it makes more sense to assert that all company personalities are necessary to create a diverse and creative market.   For leaders within a company, it is imperative to identify (and identify with!) the unique and salient strengths of their company's personality.    Only armed with this information can a company distinguish itself from its competitors.     We can initiate change in business practices, but we can not inherently change a company personality - nor should we try!    The idea of changing the personality of a company would be like trying to beat gravity!   Results does offer sound, basic business lessons regarding infrastructure necessary for business success, but it does not fulfill on the promise of understanding and leveraging a company's personality to get there.   
 This movie was a bit lame for me.  Robin Williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie, and the supporting cast wasn't much better, but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen.  Even if this had been a good movie, the green screen was very distracting.  I would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff 
 Boring, slow paced, juvenile. Irving thinks he can rescue horrible writing by including all of the explicit sex he can fit into each paragraph. The man can't even tell a story! I kept waiting for the "Catch-22" type of comic, cosmic ending.  I was certain that was where he was going. Imagine my surprise when I read to the end and found out he wasn't kidding...he was really attempting to write a story with an actual plot and characterization. What a load of crap. Don't waste your money or your time. If this is where Irving is headed, look for him in the dumpster soon with a 50-cent bottle of wine in his hand 
 This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them 
 I just returned from Tokyo, where I used this book. I really think it is better to get information from your hotel's front desk or a tourist center.  I was fortunate to be visiting a friend who is from Tokyo, had I relied on the book I would have been totally frustrated. The most glaring problems with the book are: 1) It does not know any interesting things about Tokyo, no deep insights, what the book knows are the things like "Tokyo is a modern city" "the subway is full" "life is fast paced" "It is noisy in Akhirabara". In other words the book feels like anyone could have written it, not an insider that knows Tokyo.   2) Worse, it has many factual errors, especially about the hotel. I stayed in 4 different hotels and vested a total of 9, so I did my research. Some hotels it describes as nice, new and clean are tiny dirty dumps. At least one hotel is several streets away from where the book says, and its next to a lake, so you'd think they'd get that right. Another is smack in the middle of a lively red light district with, complete with dolled up women loudly chasing drunken businessmen. Not something most American tourists would like to find, I believe.  In the end it is clear what this book is: a half hearted effort quickly thrown together by the LonelyPlanet machine, using an author that, as the book admits  (!) has not lived in Japan for over 10 years, and has no clear qualifications for writing a guidebook.  But Lonely Planet's marketing clout is huge, many small bookstores carry only LP books and then a large section of them. They have expertise in marketing not in guiding.   I also have the LP book on Kyoto, where I visited after Tokyo, and it is not as bad, though still bad enough to have several travelers I know through it out while still in Kyoto.   There are travel agencies at the airports and at the (amazing) train station in Kyoto that do have English speakers and frankly you're better off using them.   However, I must point out that I had no other guidebook to compare it to, so the others maybe just as bad. My personal advice, if you have a fully stocked bookstore, go there and pick a book from each publisher about a city that you do know. This way you can tell at least the quality of some of their writing.  Since some readers of this review will be thinking of going to Tokyo, here are my two cents, a mini travel advice, if you will: hotels can be surprisingly reasonable for the legend that is Tokyo, 100 bucks a night gets a room you'd pay at least 250 for in NYC. Travel agencies can get you better prices if your lucky, if you walk in off the street you will likely have to pay the walk in rate, the highest rate.   My Citibank card did NOT work even at ATMS that tell you on the screen that they accept Citibank cards. Ah the joys of modern banking...However, a real Citibank branch with atms that do work can be found. Citibank cheated its customers so bad that the Japanese government forced them to close many branches, so they are not that easy to find, ask your hotel. The branch in Ginza is, apparently, open 7 days a week.   Get a telephone card for public phones, they can be bought next to any row of public phones. Tokyo still has some public phones around, which is great because Japan's cell phone system is totally non-compatible with anything else. So even if you have a quad band gsm phone, you can not buy sim cards for it in Japan. You can however rent cell phones at the airport. For the business traveler with appointments here and there, it might be very helpful. You have to rent them at the airport, though, can't find em in the city.  Another thing: bring money. Tokyo is still very expensive in the year 2006. Taxi's are insane, the meter starting at 6 dollars and climbing rapidly from there. Subways system in Tokyo is everywhere, but for those that can't do allot of walking it can be tough. Most of Tokyo is bicycle friendly, bicycles astonishingly being accepted on any sidewalk (that can get real annoying, but remember we are guests there), so for those with them walking blues I suggesting renting a bike to explore around your hotel.   Everyone travels differently, for different reasons, I personally suggest: Explore the little things that seem normal to Japanese, so are not pointed out as special. Like the stuff in the 7-11 (sports drinks frozen solid, ice "cubes" in the shape of perfect round softballs etc.), which are everywhere, or the tiny unassuming store that a little old lady runs, who will gladly show you a kimono belt ("obi") if you ask, only to find out that the one belt costs 10 000 us dollars (I am glad I keep my hands clean!).    One side-note for the few who are Leica fans, Japan is indeed Leica country. If you, like me, keep a sticker over the red dot of your M or R take it off in Japan, I know it is showing off in a way, but it actually changes the way people treat you.   One final note on getting around in that culture: if you go to, say, Germany and speak English, they will understand you, and if they do not understand something, they will say that they don't understand (they will also think you are an uneducated fool, looking for oil and places to bomb, ah to be an American in the Bush era...). In Japan most people do not speak English. And those that do will always nod and pretend they understand everything you say, they do this convincingly and with amazing patience. You can go on for 10 minutes before realizing the person has no idea what you are saying. Do not be afraid to stop and ask "do you know what I mean when I say ....". They are very, very helpful and if you ask direction will actually walk you several blocks to show you, which makes it even more important to make sure they really know what you meant.  
 I have very diverse taste in music, from blues to bluegrass, and I really enjoyed this CD.  It is great for "girl time" 
 Stories are well crafted, but the subject matter didn't interest me. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again 
 Let's face it kids, this movie was bad when it came out and time does not alter that fact, however it is fun to look back and see this celluloid history of Rock N' Roll 
 Ah, the mass prison breakout, a classic (overused) storyline.  A prison breakout encourages Captain America to form a team out of the heroes who arrive to stop it, reminded of how the Avengers originally came together.  Which in this incarnation is a semi-allstar lineup, in the current tradition of the Justice League, plus Spider-Woman and Luke Cage, who are entertaining characters in the series if odd choices (someone misses the 70's).   New Avengers has its ups and downs.  The artwork is quite pretty, though sometimes the colors are mergered into another too much and it's hard to tell what's going on.  The dialogue is frequently clever and humorous, though sometimes it seems like Spider-Man is trying too hard to be funny.  The overall story moves a bit slow (not much happens in six issues), the famous "decompression" style Bendis is associated with.  I suppose what I would consider the major flaw of the book is a common one with team books: characterization.  The only character who seemed to have a unique voice at all was Spider-Man, and that's primarily because he's the wiseass.  No other characters come across as themselves, just generic superheroes.    The overall story keeps your attention, details sometimes seem glossed over, but there are a lot of clever touches in story and dialogue that I enjoyed.  The actual forming of the team was a little eh, and I would have prefered some explanation given on why Pete getting his arm broken barely bothers him.  Some of the companion pieces of the New Avengers, such as the Spider-man stories with Cap, Iron Man, and Logan as supporting characters really capture the personalities of the characters that seems to be missing here, but indicate the possibilites of this new team.  
 Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there 
 This is one of Clint's best, but the transfer is awful.   All dark scenes are grainy, highly pixellated.  The daylight scenes (fortunately the balance of the movie) are OK.  Movie 3 stars, transfer 1 star 
 When I read the summary of this book I was really excited to read it but unfortunatley, the crudeness and vulgarity of the book out weighed the story line. I thought that the plot was interesting and somehow managed to get through all the foul and obseen language and finish the book. I also was irritated that every single character didn't seem to have any morals and was very annoyed by Milly's helpless and weak personality. Needless to say I won't be reading anymore of Tilly Bagshaw's books, because who can't write a book that is about sex and the "f" word is used at least every 5 words 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This was a great let down. It is evidently an attempt to write a modern multi-cultural PC version of Margery Allingham's great London detective stories ('Tiger in the Smoke' 'The China Governess' and 'Hide My Eyes') but it fails. One of the child characters in 'The China Governess' is introduced into the novel as an adult and is an assembly of cliches.  The sense of London, so profound and chilling in Allingham's work is lost and the presentation of the city is shallow and indeed journalistic. Worse, there are authorial interventions ventriloquised via certain approved characters which read like op-ed pieces for the Independent newspaper. I'd recommend that readers try Allingham rather than Stevenson 
 The best of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories took place in the man village because that's where Mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named Buldeo.   Buldeo claims that the tiger Shere Khan is supernatural,  the ghost of a wicked old money lender.  When Mowgli says that Shere Khan is only a very disagreeable tiger Buldeo threatens to spank our young hero.    When Buldeo learns that Mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that Mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf, and back to a boy at will.  This is great story telling.  But where is Buldeo?  He isn't in the movie at all!  It's like leaving the Wicked Witch out of the movie version of "The Wizard of Oz".  On a side note, in the Kipling stories the black panther Bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but Mowgli.   Bagheera was born in a zoo, chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men.  But rather than blame Mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity Bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit.  They were both separated from their own kind at an early age.  Once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense.   We are able to understand Bagheera's total devotion to the Mowgli.  But the movie never explains that.  I realize that the movie shouldn't follow the book completely.   But since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down 
 What were they thinking?!  There are actually scenes DELETED from the original theatrical release!!  The extended edition is an "abomination" if there ever were one.    Furthermore, I discourage anyone who has not seen the original from purchasing this product.  Seek out the original release because I believe the "original" release included in this set is not of the same quality.  David Lynch was right in not becoming involved in this edition 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 YO this album can be described in the simplest term - Garbage 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 I hate to be negative about a book from the German prespective, as they are rare, but I feel I must for others not to waste their money. The book is a general and basic operational overview of the end stages of combat in the Silesia area. If you are only looking for dates, places, and names of units involved this book is for you but, if you are like me, there are ZERO personal accounts included, which are needed to "flesh" out a book like this, to give you a better understanding of the various battles described. 
 Twenty-two pages of statistics and highly technical jargon.  No practical use.  No how-to strategies.  Seems more like a technical journal article or presentation for PhD engineers.  You will not learn about six sigma from  this pamphlet 
 Would be a better title. How one can call this the `definitive guide to desktop publishing and design` is beyond me and should be arrested by the anti-idioten brigade. The lay-out itself is crap, the examples crappier. The content is everything but in-dept and outdated (even for the novice). That the writer doesn't mention anything about PDF says enough.  A far better book on graphic design and desktop publishing would be: The New Graphic Design School by Alan Swann & David Dabner.(ISBN: 0471686832). It`s not an all-in-one DTP guide like Roger`s book is supposed to be but what it covers is far more interesting and up to date than what you can find here.  Not recommended. 
 Pro's: I got my package within three days. I did recieve what I ordered. The size charts were a big help and the pants fit pretty good. Con's: On the description it says the scrubs have a high thread count and our made of non see through material. That is wrong!  The pants are soo see through that you can see the color of my legs and my white undergarments 
 - Bentley's 'Programming Pearls' offers many programming techniques and design principles. - But the text assumes that the reader is *extremely* familiar with C-style syntax and many advanced computer science concepts.  While Bentley emphasizes important fundamentals, his language is rather esoteric.  I bought this book because Steve McConnell ('Code Complete' author) recommends it for 'beginner' developers at his company (Construx Software); but I encourage 'beginner' developers (and even senior developers) to look elsewhere.  This book is meant for computer science graduate students. It incorporates more advanced math and more advanced computer science techniques than the average software developer will ever encounter.  Most of 'Programming Pearls' was penned before the widespread use of object-oriented programming; so Bentley heavily emphasizes code tuning. In today's world, most .NET and J2EE developers are likely to find greater efficiencies within their architectural design.  - Developers who need to either learn or revisit important fundamentals should read Steve McConnell's 'Code Complete' 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 This very thin tome demonstrates that the author has no understanding of research or scholarship. It is nothing more than a plagiarised version of the very few sources quoted in the lamentable section entitled "REFERENCES". Anyone seriously interested in  sausages would be well advised to give this booklet a wide berth and perhaps purchase the somewhat antiquated but nonetheless scholarly work of Antony and Araminta Hippisley-Coxe entitled "The Great Book of Sausages" 
 Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this "vintage" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear 
 This book is not only poorly written and boring..it also contains much of the same information that was in a much-better earlier book; "Presidential Lies: The Illustrated History of White House Golf" by Shep Campbell and Peter Landau. This book by Van Natta doesn't offer anything new or noteworthy and is not as exciting or amusing to read. Plus the author brags that he played with Clinton. So what? Clinton will play with just about any journalist who asks. For the real deal, definitely check out "Presidential Lies.&quot 
 I bought this book based on the rave reviews, but I found it to be depressing not hauntingly beautiful. I couldn't identify with or like any of the characters. It just seems totally unrealistic that so many bad things can happen to so many people who are unknowingly linked 
 If you are looking for the Nickel Creek we listen to now, you will be sorely disappointed. However, If you want to hear the band when they were kids, this is for you. Even then, their talent was evident 
 Where do I start? This is awful. "Underneath Your Clothes" sounds too much like Alanis Morrisette's "Head Over Feet." "Whenever, Wherever" sounds much better in the Spanish-version "Suerte" and the video to that was alright. The rest of the songs sound like 1980's leftovers retrieved from the trash. Other than that, Shakira sounds absolutely dreadful. It's like hearing someone scratching their nails down a chalkboard. This chick doesn't know if she wants to emulate Jewel, Alanis Morrisette, or Britney Spears.  But I guess she was like, "F*** it! I'll sound like all three!" and all you get is chaos. You can't even tell what kind of emotion Shakira is trying to express in a song because her voice is so messed up. "Laundry Service" sucks and "Oral Fixation" Vol. 1 and 2 are even worse. Shakira's easy on the eyes but she's killer on the ears. She needs to dye her back to its original black color and take some singing lessons 
 I will tell you why I did not read this book. The back cover shows it is unnecessary by telling you every single tip you will get to know in this book. The tips are so simple, TOO SIMPLE, you will wonder how this guy even managed to make a book out of tips your teachers and your parents have told you a billion times. If you are a D-student, this book will help you by telling you to start working instead of writing notes to your girlfriend/boyfriend of 1 day and plans to break up. Just read the back cover and write down what you plan of doing. If you are a A/B student, go home. A poster can do the job of this book.  Another problem would be that since this tips are so simple, you may not have the attension span to read every atom of a detail behind it.  
 Look inside this book at a bookstore before you buy it. It is NOT about cabins but about huge lodges-log mansions, if you will. 
 This book is not for anyone who hasn't done programming before. After a nice introduction and history report, the author suddenly starts showing you charts with things like "ushort 2 0 is 65,535". And says stuff like "Using floats, you can represent the numbers 1.0 and 1.00000012, but you can't represent any number between." What?! What does ushort mean? What are floats?! I must be just stupid, because when I read "This book approaches the topic of C# for a total beginner", I thought it meant it was for a noob like me 
 Shiro Amano has taken the story of a beautifully animated game and turned it into a poorly done doujinshi series.  The story line follows the game almost to the letter, from what I can tell of this first volume, but the quality of the work leaves a lot to be desired.  I was extremely disappointed when I picked this up in the bookstore--I was expecting something that resembled the quality of the game's graphics, not a manga that might as well have been a clone of the .hack//Legend of the Twilight series in terms of childish artwork.  If you're looking for a quick and easy retelling of the story of Kingdom Hearts and can get past the obnoxious artwork, this is the thing for you.  If not, you're better off sticking with the game 
 Considering he was one half of the excellent Wham! great things were expected from Mr Michael when he went solo. Unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster. Fans of classics such as Wham Rap, Bad Boys and Club Tropicana Drinks Are Free will be bitterly disappointed. It seems obvious to me that Andrew Ridgeley had been carrying Mr Michael for years 
 I have lost all I have ever knew of love, - my lover, my best friend, my companion, my heart and soul. And all too many times I have been told,"You are young, and you are beautiful; you will overcome and move on." IT is sad to know that those whom you depend upon for support and comfort cannot say anything to ease your suffering. BUt you cannot blame htem, for when they cannot know your suffering, there are no right words to say. So you seek out books like these, -- searching every possible source for some answer, some peace, some solace that might help you to find the strength to rise from bed each day...... I am sorry to tell you that if it is true comfort and peace you seek, as you rifle thrugh the myraids of books of this sort for just one paragraph, one sentence, one word that might uplift and embrace your broken soul -- you will not find it here. This book is an account of several readings under various circumstances, given in dialogue fashion. Not a source of information. Not a dissertation of the afterlife. My beloved, my first and only love, died months ago of a suicide, in which he had hinted to but I found too late to save him. I seek to follow him, as I know what had drove him to this, and I endure the very same cicrumstances that drove him to end his life. I told him I could not go on without him --- and I know my days are short, because he left me behind. The section in this book on suicide enraged and sickened me, -- how he claimed that those who take their lives are punished and condemend to suffer their death and witness the effects of their passing over and over again in a continuous loop -- I not only do not believe this to be true, but find it to be cruel and demonic at most.  While suicide might to many seem an act of weakness, cowardice, or selfishness, -- if you have not walked in that person's shoes, you cannot know the torment and suffering they have faced all their life. Nor can you know that for all their many nights of crying out to God with all their soul for peace and salvation, and finding no relief, -- that after a life filled with so much agony and angst they should be condemned to suffer all the more. Where is this God of mercy and of of love, the he should suffer his children further in such a way? I bought this book for the very reason that it contained a section on suicide, and I had hoped that it might shed light on what my precious  husband had endured in the last of his hours, -- and if he knew that I was there performing CPR, begging him to breathe, crying out to God to spare him..... but this book, and what it contained, filled me with bitterness and incredible anger that Van Praagh could assume such things. The fact is -- unless you have DIED, and you have TRULY been there -- YOU HAVE NO IDEA of what awaits you beyond this life. But to make the claim that these dear tortured souls who suffered so much in their life that they could not bear to continue are in turn damned to suffer all the more for seeking release is an ugly and horrible suggestion, and I do not believe it for one moment. My husband life was filled with ridicule, persecution, hardships, struggle, disappointment, and failure  - and to hear Van Praagh say that because he begged God on his knees in tears for release and was rewarded with a perpetual hell tenfold worse than anything he had known in life is just dispicable. God will have mercy on my darling, and he will have mercy on me should I join him, because I cannot bear this life without him. And if I am to suffer, -- it can be nothing compared to how I ache without him. So bring it on. You might be gifted in soem degree, James, -- but your personal opinions on certain subjects do not belong in a book in which people seek fact and not your personal bias. May God have mercy on YOUR soul for the many you have emotionally scarred by saying these things which have been heard by the masses who have lost a loved one through suicide. And maybe all you you "psychic" might do better if you would write something ORIGINAL, rather than rehashing and reinstating the same material in your books over and over again and merely changng the title....... just a suggestion 
 In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.  However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway 
  After reading some of the review for this book on this site, I question if these reviewer were sober when they wrote there reviews. The book is boring,and after a few chapters you'd maybe start looking for a new book. And if that CD breaks, from what i've been told, you'll have a hard time getting another one from the book company. I'd suggest you check out your local book store and take a look inside the book before you buy it; it would save u alot headache 
 When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music.  The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut 
 It took me a long time to get past the first few pages of this book.  I kept putting it down and picking it up again because I thought it might improve if I got far enough into it.  Wrong!  The premise of two lawyers, one who was out of work for a few months and now lands a job as a Manhattan ADA, and the other who's hoping to make partner in a high powered firm is dull and predictable.  Sara Tate, the new kid on the block in the DA's office gets a volatile case that will either make or break her career.  Her naivete in dealing with the worst criminal element in New York is laughable.  Her husband, Jared Lynch, spends more time kissing butt trying to make partner than practicing law.  It's self-obsessed Yuppies at their finest.  Overall, this book was disappointing at best.  Weak plot line, terrible ending, and too many neurotic, self-absorbed characters.  Do yourself a favor -- watch a rerun of L.A. Law instead of reading this book.  Actors Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey play similar roles to the characters in this book and you will find that they are much more believable and entertaining 
 I recently purchased a copy of this edition, having loaned a niece with children my copy from a couple of years ago (which I may not get back...but that's okay) last Christmas.  It's a let-down from the other version; the interview with Arthur Rankin (informative) is missing, the scene where Yukon finds his dream as Rudolph and Santa are leaving Christmastown is cut out (one of the key scenes deleted from the TV airings to make room for ads) again, yet the question on the trivia game on it is there.  The Destiny's Child video is okay for the younger audiences but..me, I have an idea; why not a little info and maybe footage of who first popularized the song in the first place: Gene Autry?  I just ordered another copy of the older edition from 2000. 
 Len Sweet usually writes more with more passion and intelligence that he evidences in this book. Snipets of insight into an eclectic alphabetized list of topics result in a whole lot of next to nothing.  BUT Sweet et al still have a few fascinating things to say -- just not many 
 Not only a disappointment, but also a condescending affront and disservice to the overwhelming majority of southerners.  I had hoped for some new insight into the cultural phenomena associated with the confederacy, but what I got was a collage of stories - many of which frankly seemed contrived or at least highly embellished - from an isolated and irrelevant fringe of southern society.   As a native southerner (50 plus years of living and traveling throughout the region), I honestly did not recognize the south that he describes, and have never once met a single character of the ilk that this book focuses on.  Yes, they do surely exist and most southerners are at least somewhat interested in the confederacy (after all, its part our heritage), but the author leaves you with the impression that the fringe characters that he describes are as common and ubiquitous as the kudzu that covers much of the south.  This is a gross distortion of reality and simply does not jibe with reality.  What was the author thinking when he wrote this?   I honestly have to question his intellectual honesty and motives in writing this book.  Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 Normally, I like film noir and Clive Owen so I thought the two together would be an unbeatable combination. The premise was provoking enough--the son of a compulsive gambler takes a job as a croupier in a casino to make ends meet. Will the addiction that ruined his father and his family drag him in as well? Is Jack stronger than the siren call of the roulette wheel or does he simply have a different kind of addiction? Unfortunately, these themes of fathers and sons and coming to terms with family history are not well-developed and the story kind of peters out. I was on the verge of turning off the DVD at several points because I was both bored and depressed, but hung in there hoping that it would improve. It didn't. The film makers seemed to think that unnecessary female nudity would make up for the main character failing to have an epiphany. It doesn't. The ending was also confusing. Was Jack's girlfriend killed as payback for the botched robbery or was her death completely unrelated? Bottom line: a lot of good actors are wasted in what is a very unsatisfactory film 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 We bought this for our snowboarding 11-year-old son. Being used to Playstation and Gamecube, he wasn't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky. It's a cool concept-- but it needs more time in development 
 I've read all of Penelope Stokes books and anticipated another great story when Delta Belles was published. Penelope stayed true in Delta Belles with her past reputation of rich truths from the Bible, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. As I was reading, I wondered throughout the book how she was going to resolve the lesbian issue. After I read the last page, I was dismayed. I immediately checked the publisher and found she had changed to Random House. Previously her books were published from Westbow Press. From their web site: "...partnering with today's best writers who--from their distinctly Christian worldview--are creating some of the world's most engaging stories." The jacket cover says nothing about the lesbian issue, so I felt deceived when I finished the book. I cannot recommend this book to my friends. I do know and love several people who have chosen homosexuality as a lifestyle, but that doesn't mean I approve of it. For those of you who are interested, this site clearly states our God's thoughts on homosexuality and what He says in the Bible.[... 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 The book did not give you tips on the special missions or much on car setup. The only thing of use was the car and prize check off list, but there is no information on Peugeot's Cars anywhere in the book 
 This book may please casual fans or beginners to the Southern Rock genre. It's poorly written and hardly offers any insight to Lynyrd Skynyrd. There are a lot of errors and gaps, which will leave you with more questions about this band than before reading it. No extensive discography (I'm still wondering about the exact order of Muscle Shoals material) or any revelations concerning releases or the band and its members. Feels like a lot of gossip and hearsay. Definitely not satisfying. One star is for doing a book on Southern Rock 
 this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything. i didn't even like the story. i would give this book a big fat ZERO if i could!! 
 As fans of 'Starship Troopers' know, the very name 'Starship Troopers' implies a galaxy-sweeping epic with lots of violence, gore, heroism, humor, drama and tons of big-budget special effects.  This one is limited to one location, his lots of gore but  little in the humor, drama and big-budget special effects department.  One has to wonder at the thought processes in Hollywood. 'Starship Troopers' was a big success. Sure, it was expensive, but it is also a regular staple on cable TV and it continues to sell well (#2500 or so on Amazon in DVD sells as of today - which isn't bad for a 10 year old movie).  One would think that a Starship Troopers 2 would have been in the works for a long time - perhaps a final push to the bug home system. Instead, according to the director's commentary track, the special effects director of the original Starship Troopers came up with this simple, low-budget plot that he wanted to direct.  Somehow sold it to the powers-that-be at Sony and they backed it, provided that he slash his already bare bones budget even more.   So, what do you get when you give Starship Troopers 2 a budget that is only 5% (yes - five percent!) the size of the original movie? A bad movie full of special effects tricks that you are most likely to see in 50s sci-fi cult classics. The movie's premise changes from being a war epic to being a haunted castle movie, a premise that the producers and director freely admit to on the director's track. They also admit to it being a "B movie" and that it was intentionally filmed to go straight to DVD. Some reviewers have made comments about it being a poorly-lit movie. That was also intentional - poor lighting means that the movie's special effects can be of lesser quality. Unfortunately, one of Tippett's other compensations for a low budget is to add more blood to every scene in the last half of the movie. It gets silly after a while, rather than dramatic.  The movie is derivative of several other movies and TV shows including:  -Star Trek: TNG. Remember the plot that Picard uncovered in which aliens were physically inserting themselves into the brains of high-ranking members of Star Fleet? Well, I hate to write a spoiler, but...  X-Files. Same as a above  Aliens - there's a scene that just steals from the one in which the Paul Reiser character drops an alien into Ripley's sleeping quarters.  Alien - the dark sets with a creepy monster about.  John Carpenter's 'The Thing' - the premise of being an outpost cut off from the rest of humanity while an alien takes people over one by one. The scene where the General is chased into the base steals from the one in which the dog in 'The Thing' is chased to the Antarctic research lab by the helicopter.   Brenda Strong comes to this movie as a familiar face, but not as the same character. Her character in the original Troopers was a fleet captain who died a horrible death. In this one she is an army sergeant. No one is quite sure why they felt the need to have a face from the first mivie but she does a good job and on the director's track they credit her with making this movie shoot a positive experience on a lot of levels. That makes it all the more bizarre that her name is not listed on the cover of the DVD or on the back cover credits. Too bad - her character was just about the closest thing that I found to believable in the whole movie.  I give this two stars rather than one because I found the director's/producer's track to be quite fascinating. Maybe it should only be watched with that track playing.  I give this one a D-. It fails to deliver on the promise of the original in so many ways 
 This is one of the worst software development books I have ever read.  Both grammatical and syntactical programming mistakes are present frequently throughout the text.  Do not get this book 
   This title is not up to the high standards set by McLachlan's other books. The text does not get into details which are thoroughly discussed in McLachlan's excellent "The EM Algorithm and Extensions." Some important points are so condensed and in places so poorly presented that the the discussion is worthless. For example the important section 3.4 "Standard Errors", which underlies much of the discussion contains errors.    The book could be useful to a practioner who is only looking for guidance in fitting mixture models with available software.  Unfortanately McLachlan's mixture software referred to in the Appendix, is not available. That's a pity because the advertised software features and design potentially rank it the top choice.   For a user who will use his own EM software to fit mixture models I would recommend highly the McLachlan's EM Algorithm book  over the Mixture book. 
 This book was like the now rapidly failing "dot.coms".  A title to grab you but no content.  This is not a book about e-business despite what it says on the cover!  There is hardly anything on e-business let alone how you can use App. Servers to get e-business going.  Even the stuff on App. Servers wasn't very detailed.  This is like a vanity press book 
 I think Mr Gold's book is a good idea and his heart is in the right place but he will not win any awards for simple explanations. I've read this book cover to cover, some parts multiple times, in an attempt to decipher what he meant versus what he said. I find it confusing that Mr Gold discusses vapor barriers in two parts of the book and seems to say different things in each section, for example. I'm an intelligent person and can follow directions but Mr Gold's writing style does not sit well with me nor did it help to truly understand what I needed to do. If you are building a wine cellar in an unfinished old stink cellar, this may be for you, but if you are building a wine cellar in a finished basement or other portion of your house, obtain the "room preparation" documentation from a "wine enthusiast" type company instead 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 Probably a great resource if you're interested in being a standup comic.  Other than that, there's not really that much in this book I found useful or interesting...  a lot of name-dropping, though!  Apparently every comedian throughout the history of standup has taken one of Judy Carter's classes 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is.  The new earl is such a child in character that I got bored after a hundred pages and threw the book away.  This obviously was not thought out by the author.  This is not a romance,  but a calamity. Boo! Boo! on the author.  This is terrible writing.  I do not recommend this book 
 I made the mistake in buying this book. I thought it was about Filipino Martial Arts....it's about how a supposedly avid practitioner of the FMA keeps refering to Japanese and Indonesian arts trying to lump everything and anything under FMA.  It's really sad because these so called 10th degree grandmasters let these guys crap all over Filipino Martial Arts and get away with it.  It's not Japanese or Indonesian..it's Filipino....The author wrote a book with nothing but his own opinion...he probably never been to the Philippines.       Sorry but Sarongs and Kerambits are not Filipino...Guys need a reality check.  Stop bastardizing the art!  I'm sorry I bought this book and I'm sad that this is how some Filipinos are teaching the art just to make everybody happy and to fatten their wallets 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 The machine is less than $40 so my expectations were in line with that (cheap), however it never really seemed to stitch, at least, I thought it would stitch even the simplest items, and I only used it about 5 time sin a year, but it didn't, and it would stick on every job, it was frustrating. It eventually broke, and I was sorry to say it still looked brand new, and that was the shame of it - it was too cheap to fix, and I was forced to throw it away.   
 I love this song, and it is my favorite on the album. I was really looking forward to the cd single being released, and waited around 2 months for it to finally come out. When it did come out in Australia, it only contained the radio edit, junior sanchez mix and new song history.Looks as though we only got Jump part 2 here in Australia.   I was very disappointed that the other remixes were not included,  and I did not like the junoir sanchez mix at all. I was really looking forward to hearing the Jaques Lu cont mix, as I have enjoyed his past work for Madonna, and also the extended album version. Unfortunately neither were included on the cd single in Australia.  
 My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good.. 
 I have had to replace my Audiovox DVD Player twice!  The first time was because the sensor was not reading the DVD; the second was because the rechargeable battery would not charge.  And, now Audiovox is telling me that to buy a new battery will cost $79.00 plus shipping and handling.  This cost is 3/4 the cost I paid for the 2nd audiovox.  And, of course, they (Audiovox) will not offer any discount or compensation for their "sad" product.  And, the sound/volume is horrible with earphones! Sometimes it's worth to pay for a quality name brand product, that has value 
 I could only get to page 17 before I threw it into the trash. It was given to me by a neighbor so it was free.  Too expensive even at that price!!!! 
 The Alex Cross series by James Patterson started out incredibly strong with a couple of excellent novels to the start the series in "Along Came a Spider" and "Kiss the Girls."  These novels were truly exceptional when it came to being edge of the seat thrillers, page turners, and plot twisters.  They were a standard by which I and many others judged other novels in this genre.  As the Cross series continued, the quality of the novels began to decline.  For one, Cross is supposed to be a detective.  However, as this series has progressed, he has done less and less detective work.  He usually just follows leads until he happens upon the villain, and then Cross is praised as a major hero.  Second, the plot twists, for which this series use to be famous for, have become very contrived.  Instead of that "I can't believe I didn't see that coming feeling," or "man, was I fooled" sensation, the plot twists frequently leave me saying, "that was absolutely ridiculous."  Many of these very flaws have found their way into "Londond Bridges."  This novel picks up where "Big Bad Wolf" left off.  Some sort of Russian mad man has created a criminal empire, is capable of unspeakable cruelty, and has more criminal plans to execute.  Cross, formerly of the Washington P.D. and now with the FBI, has been tasked with tracking down the Wolf.  This novel, like the others in the series, switches back from first to third person story telling.  When the chapters focus on Cross, they frequently are told in first person from Cross's point of view.  When other characters are central to the storytelling, then the narrative switches to third person.    This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the later chapters, the third person omniscient narrator lies to the reader!  To be clear, the narrarator doesn't provide clues and lets the reader jump to their own conclusion.  The narrator deliberately tells the reader something that isn't so.  Then, the narrator attempts to turn this into a plot twist a few pages later.  This is extremely aggravating.  Many, if not most, of the plot twists in this novel just come off flat.  To a certain degeree, you are left asking "who cares?" or thinking to yourself "he couldn't possibly thought he got him this time."  The redeeming quality of this book is that Patterson doesn't pull punches.  Several monuments, buildings, and bridges throughout the world are targetted by the Wolf.  Don't expect last second rescues.  In addition, Cross's personal life has more and more problems thrown at it.  The resolution of those problems doesn't happen easily, but at least Pattrson doesn't let Cross off easily.  My opinion is that perhaps Patterson has spread himself a little too thin across all his projects.  He just posted in his blog that he has five, and maybe six, novels to come out next year.  It appears the focus needed to make a great Cross novel is lacking.  I've heard good things about "Mary, Mary," the next novel in the series, so I suspect I will pick that one up.  However, it is potentially my last Cross, if not Patterson, novel.  Overall:  2.5 star 
 ...Dear God, please strike me blind! I'd rather see a test pattern than this piece of cra 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic "I'll be back" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1 
 I don't know why everyone thinks that Patricia Cornwell is such a HOT writer!  I find her books to be very poorly written with many inaccuracies.  In this book Kay orders a "Palligrini water with Lemon" and then two pages later she calls the bartender back over to forget the "Chardonnay" and orders something stronger.  What's that about?  Doesn't anyone edit or proofread her books before they go to print?  With the pre-publication money in her pocket; I guess they don't need to. Sloppy, slopply, sloppy.  I think she would feel like she owes it to her fans and readers who keep putting up with this stuff just for a possible interesting story and plot line.  Even if most of them are borrowed from the newspapers.  This will be the last of her books that I will read 
 I purchased this book after having read a story in the Boston Globe about speech and how important it is when giving presentations or job interviews.  I hoped that this book would give me better speaking skills.  To this end, there are some good points in this book, but they are buried between the name dropping and self promoting that the author does will annoying frequency.    For example, the skill that seems to be the cornerstone of the techniques presented in this book is a method of breathing.  The author explains that not everyone gets this method at first and describes how one famous client (yet another name drop) required five one hour sessions before she got the hang of it.  Yet, the author expects the reader to be able to learn the breathing method from the one paragraph that she dedicates to explaining the method.    In summary, I believe that it is possible to learn some skills from this book, but I wish that the author spent more time explaining the skills and less on self promotion.  You may want to consider another book 
 What a bore. truelly watching paint dry is of more interest then this self inflated bore 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 I didn't like this very droll movie.  It was unbelievable, and plot less.  There was some plot there, but it was messed with by the illogical sequences.    When I saw it, I thought of a bad version of "Scarface."  I swear, the scene where they chop up the body was trying to pay homage to the Chainsaw scene in Scarface.  It was "bloody" awful (pun intended!)  I love most Martin Lawerence movies, and see most in the theater (or DVD's these days.)  Ironically, I dislike most Will Smith movies.  Don't know why.  But together, they are gold, usually better than Martin alone.  But this entire movie was a mess.    What I did like: I love the "colorful" Miami theme that all shows and movies in Miami seem to carry.  I think there was one scene in a Jamaican shop, where bullets were blowing around, and I remember seen bright, beautiful colors flowing around.  That was quite clever.  I think the outfits were interesting, though, the Latino mobsters clothes looked so 80's, perhaps another wink to 80's scarface.  The boys didn't seem relaxed in this movie.  Seemed rushed, and trying to squeeze in as much action as possible.    All in all, a rushed, poor job!  Two thumbs down!  MC White said:  Not good 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 There is a problem with the DVD, it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary 
 There is no doubt that both of them are well-educated gentlemen. This destory the whole purpose of the book - they are too polite to have any confrontation. Throughout the whole book, they are just presenting each other their own views. They actually haven't met each other to have a discussion and in fact, the title of the book misled me. It should be called "Belief or Non-Belief: Some Correspondences 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 It's time to retire this old book which is amazingly rigid in its decorating ideas and its school-marmish, rules-oriented approach to design. Decorating today is so personal, yet Martha (or this old book, anyway) seems to think that there is only one way to do things. It reminds me of a 1950s book filled with rules for the little housewife to follow, but it certainly doesn't fit the world of today's educated, style-conscious, and confident consumer. Bleah 
 I fall asleep at every single chapter. I think that it's meant for older people AND as a torturing device for high school students! (AHS -I hate summer assignments!) I mean, come on! We're only rising 11th graders! This kind of stuff doesn't interest most of us yet 
 After a while you'll never get those "rugged concentric grooves" clean and you will be grossed out by your own cookwear.  I'd never recommend Circulon cookware because of this, especially since there are so many high-quality, smooth-bottomed pans on the market 
 I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.  
 G.P. Taylor struck out with his much-hyped debut, the tepid religious fantasy "Shadowmancer." And the follow-up, "Wormwood," is even less engaging than "Shadowmancer" was -- while it's fairly well written, it's loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot.        In the mid 1700s, London is gripped by panic -- somehow the earth is overspinning, and suddenly stops so that London is plunged into permanent night. A young servant girl, Agetta, is terrified of what is going to happen, especially because her master, Kabbalah master and scientist Dr Sabian Blake, is predicting that a comet called Wormwood will strike the earth.         This information comes from the mysterious book, Nemorensis, that Blake was given by a stranger. The Nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, the book also exerts a sinister influence over Agetta. But in an attic is Tegatus, an angelic being who might just be the savior London needs...        Religious fantasy, or fantasy with religious undertones, is not a bad thing -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life's work. But G.P. Taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram -- he's also quite boring. The story plods along in a string of little plot-related scenes, without building up much momentum.        One of the biggest problems is the way Taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book. Okay, there are weird creatures. Most fantasy books have those. But his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason. His handling of superstition and science in the 1700s is sketchy at best, no matter how brilliant a scientist Blake is meant to be.        Taylor has a decent enough writing style, and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere. But his style is also very repetitive and over-the-top -- where are the editors when you need them? What's worse, his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot. The actual fantasy plot is just more of Taylor's lukewarm, generic Christian sentiments.        The characters are as thin as the pages. There are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book, and many of them are left underdeveloped. Blake and Agetta are the only ones who receive any character development, and that isn't saying much. Agetta in particular seems almost manic, considering how fast her moods swing. Tegatus is just freakin' boring.        G.P. Taylor strikes out again with "Wormwood," another dull religious fantasy that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Boring, messy, and not worth the effort it takes to wade through 
 While the premise of this book is intriguing the delivery was disappointing at best. The analogies between golf and business were  trite and not very illustrative.  Good analogies between golf and business process analysis do exist, such as the way that statistical analysis and feedback loops are used by pros to reduce variation in shot accuracy and eliminate wasted motion in their swings. "Shots into bunkers represent waste" is about as sophisticated as this book gets.    
 The book is very small, which should have been an indication.  Printed in India, most of the pages are blurred or faint printing.  Not readable.  A huge price for something unusable 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 I should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like "Lemon Pledge"...it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all.  I'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room 
 I was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature.  Some of the pages were blank, having not even been printed.  I figure the book was a total loss of money spent 
 I am pretty shocked at how many people liked this book. This is the fifth Hannah Swensen mystery I've read and was a major disapointment for me. First of all, there were just WAY too many characters to keep up with. Following Hannah as she basically just questions every single person she can think of gets pretty boring. The last hundred pages especially seemed to drag and I just wanted to get to the end already and see who it was. then the case was solved completely out of nowhere. Another major issue for me was that Hannah seemed very annoying in this book. She seemed like a complete know-it-all and the fact that she'll make out with one guy and then turn around and make out with another. And don't you find it ironic that a book whose main character is constantly correcting everyone has so many grammatical errors and typos 
 (review of ADAM'S FALLACY - A GUIDE TO ECONOMIC THEOLOGY by Duncan K. Foley,  The Belknap  Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 2006  pp. xvi-265)  review by  WALLACE F. SMITH,  WALNUT CREEK, CA  Adam Smith (1723-90),  a Scotsman, espoused liberty. He saw American colonists repudiate their king. He saw French commoners execute king and nobles in the name of "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity."  The book he published in 1776, THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, liberated human economic life around the globe. Trade became free.  Before that privileged classes dictated what was to be produced,  precisely how,  who was to benefit and at what prices. Workers were bound to their workplace, like galley slaves, and all their activities rigidly controlled.  Progress was thwarted.  People raised arms against tyrants. Adam Smith gave revolution a gospel. The world changed forever.  Economic actvity can and will  manage itself.  Producers make what consumers are willing to buy; prices must meet the needs of factors of production (land, labor and capital). Collective enterprise is driven by profit and expands cumulatively.  Smith had faith in this sytem.  Followers argued specifics and discovered flaws. David Ricardo demonstrated the efficiency of importing, tax free what a nation's own resources limit. Swiss mathematician Euler proved that paying every factor of production - land, labor and capital - their respective "marginal"  worth - incremental  effects on output - equitably distributes all income.  But land and capital are "property" meaning legal rights. A moral issue arises - what is "property"? For a thousand years polemicists asserted the right of "society" to enjoy what property earns. This is called "socialism." Propertied classes denounce socialism and use force against it.  Adam Smith had very brave insight but not logical discipline (math). Pseudo scholars such as Duncan Foley preach sermons about choice - left-wing socialism versus right-wing fascism. The tragedy of Russia shows that with the best of intentions modern economic life is too complex for command economics.  Author Foley has published very muddle-headed rambling on the subject. To wit:"... there is no way to determine the contribution to production of any one input ..."  p. 164. Duncan is unaware that Euler did just that; Samuelson's immensely popular textbook lays out the mysteries of production functions - Euler's theorem. The secret lies in partial derivatives.  Calculus is a prerequisite for any meaninful economics course 
 I thought this was a film about Caouette's mother and her struggles. I thought it was about how she was subjected to electric shocks and maltreatment. I thought I would see a documentary about her life. And what did I see? An extraordinarily self-centered and self-obsessed young man forcing his ego on me. It's all about him, him, him. It seemed more like an exercise in self-display than a film about a serious topic. Stay away from this film 
 I am 40 years old and have been a sci-fi fan for at least 24 years. I read an average of 2-3 books per week (not all sci-fi). I held off reading Sirens because I like to read humorous sci-fi on vacations (just my quirk). I can honestly say I was extremely dissappointed in this story, and I think most real sci-fi fans will be as well. I think people are afraid to criticize this book anymore because it is so widely praised, but if they were honest, it's a mixed bag at best.  Some spoilers ahead...be warned.  Vonnegut makes a lot of promises early on in this novel that he never fulfills. The experience becomes much ado about nothing. I understand some people are absolutely engaged by Vonnegut's exploration of the human condition and the pathos involved, but it all came off trite to me. There are other novels by Herbert and Heinlein that do it much better. Deserting main charachters on park benches to die isn't really exploring the human condition as much as admitting you led the reader down a path with no destination.    His fade-in, fade-out antoginist really is lacking in depth. He's a stereotypical WASP we are supposed to like because he is destroying all those dogmatic religions by creating a new...(suprise) a new dogmatic religion. It's like Vonnegut thinks he's the only one to ever conclude that religion might be holding back humanity, but then has no idea how to fix it and in the end sticks to convention. This plot point ends up a huge wash to me.  Of course the most annoying plot point right on top of the cake is the promise of this magical destination Titan and the title's Sirens. We are shown their picture, which is supposed to be beauty beyond compare, but never a description. In the end they are just statues on a barren landscape, yet another cop-out.   In the end we discover that the point of humanity's entire maddening history has been to provide a part for a broken alien spaceship. Of course, one would expect that part to be complicated enough that it required such manipulation and effort. One might even suspect that it was too hard for a single alien to make. Not here. It's hard to suspend disbelief about a piece of ribbon steel 1 inch wide and 6 inches long with a square hole punched in it. It apparently required 20,000 years of human history to produce it, instead of the alien using a coke can or some analog on his elaborate ship.  There are some creative bits to this story. The trip to Mercury definitely was well done. Unfortunately the humor and creativity feel like unrelated bits strung together along one of the worst plot lines ever created. I really wanted to like this book. I really wanted to recommend it. I can't. If you like books with solid plots, some sci-fi, some religion, some philosophy about the human condition, and interesting charachters, go read Stranger in a Strange Land again.  
 I thought it was time I expanded my literary experience to include a higher-education type author. Big mistake. I always try to see a book through to the end no matter what but this one really tested that conviction. I was ready to pitch it into the fire after the first chapter as Mr. Kafka himself suggested we do with all of his 'work'. And why didn't I like it? Because it's nothing more than disturbed stream-of-consciousness phychobabble...dark, depressing, manic, mundane, absurd, surreal. Very Lewis Carrolesque but without the imagination and color. You feel as if you're trapped in this guys never-ending disjointed dream with the vague awareness that you will eventually wake up. You do, after you turn the last page and realize that you've just wasted far too much valuable time dedicated to finishing a work that hasn't enriched your knowledge, sparked your imagination or widened your scope of understanding. I don't care how cheap you can buy it...don't 
 Repetitious and disappointing for someone who bought all Santana records LP's CDs and DVDs 
 If you enjoy instrumental spiritual music then you would like this product.  However, I prefer a great vocalist to complement the instrumental, and I am dissatisfied with the CD 
 Senator Obama is an engaging speaker and has potential to be a leader, but this book doesn't offer any new insights or solutions to the political climate we have today in the USA.  Nicely written but the next book will tell whether he can avoid the decline into standard partisan behavior now that the Dems are in charge of Congress.  Time will tell 
 It has pretty much all been said, let's just say it again 'cause I'm sure Firaxis/Firefly will plant positive reviews here. The game takes ages to load, the voice acting is silly (British? Australian? Herman's Hermits?), the progression is totally linear (ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels), the graphics date to 2002, and the citizen 'fetching' system is completely random and opaque. Sit and watch for awhile: your huts will change size every thirty seconds.   Most importantly, boo Sid, boo. You could've produced this bad Caesar3 ripoff and called it anything, but you called it "CivCity", and even put a tiny Civilopedia in it. Haven't you got enough money? The Civ Series is brilliant. Don't cash it in 
 Of all the books which dominated the discussion of analytic philosophy in the 90s, John McDowell's *Mind and World* was actually the one which most nearly brought home the prize of great philosophy without naughty bits: and this most nearly in the form of an inversion of Lukacs, "Reification and the Consciousness of the Professoriat".  His early Oxgaffes having been forgotten, McDowell was here free to offer an "unpolitical" account of contemporary thought drawing heavily from classic works.  But if the result is not quite Robert Brandom's linguistic Leninism, the reader ends up getting a story about "who's to be master" that has a little too much excitement squeezed into McDowell's oscillating queries.  Much as Brandom makes a hash of the relationship between formal semantics and "inferentialism", McDowell's account of Hegel's relationship to *Bildung* does not even crib Gadamer's "historically effective consciousness" as a corrective to his "uncritical" eudaemonism (those interested in Hegel's intellectual relationship to Aristotle would do well to look at Alfredo Ferrarin's book instead) -- and the excitement one is  forever waiting on with respect to Sellars is pressed into service for a thoroughly unserviceable treatment of Hegel's remark "in thinking, I am free, because I am not in an other" -- very much the product of Stoic philosophy, and very much militating against the "therapeutic" story about non-conceptual content directly following (with apologies rendered to Peacocke for his rather more serviceable story).   Is any of this that objectionable?  No, and although McDowell's work was very much "in a vogue" for a while (i.e., served upon you according to his lecture specifications) this (as well as his essays) is fine reading concerning stylistics with respect to thoughts of the form "whereof we cannot speak..."  But none of it is as thoroughly "Wittgensteinian" as presented, and if McDowell can still coherently be accused of rendering a disservice to that philosopher this heavily syncretist work must be counted as one such.  I expect this is not the case, however, and as such cannot in good conscience recommend this book to interested readers: if you are in the grip of a worry, perhaps you should stay there, and if you feel differently perhaps being notified of your pseudo-problems will not help overmuch.  Something of a lecture-stuffer 
 This book has some good information for alternative cancer treaments. The Essiac that they talk about is really a great way to go! We are using this to help fight pancreatic cancer. 
 I just returned from a 2 week trip to the Yucatan peninsula. Starting off in Cancun and driving the cultural triangle route to the east to visit the Mayan ruins (Chichen Itza, Coba, Uxmal etc... and Spanish colonial cities (Merida, Valladolid etc...). For professional reasons I took along 4 travel guides (The Rough Guide to Cancun & Cozumel, DK's Eyewitness Top 10 Cancun & The Yucatan, Hidden Cancun & the Yucatan, and the Cadogan Yucatan & Mayan Mexico. In the past I've also used the frustrating Moon guide and weak Lonely Planet).   Of the 4 guides, each quite different in focus and style, I found "Hidden Cancun and the Yucatan" undoubtedly the most annoying and rate it 2 stars. Perhaps it's a bit stingy with the stars - other people have given it 5 stars, but with several other guides to compare it to, it's weaknesses became more and more apparent. Neither a good detailed history of the region nor particularly interesting or detailed in describing towns, cities and Mayan sites. The "Cadogan Yucatan & Mayan Mexico" though slightly larger and heavier was in a different league and perhaps the best book on the region for these purposes but also immensely enjoyable and readable with many excellent recommendations for food and accommodation.  The format "Hidden Cancun and the Yucatan" (a largish thick paperback seems) to suggest the same purpose but I think did a mediocre haphazard job. Even as a reference guide it fails to deliver with a pathetic lack of photographs and maps - those provided were as good as useless for reference (instead The rough Guide and Top 10 were infinitely superior and genuinely useful). By contrast, the reference information in "Hidden" is so poorly layed out and not conveniently accessible - excuse the pun, but without much better visuals, layout and concise text, "Hidden" does a good job of hiding it's information - not good when one is on the fly. For example different towns and villages were blended in a linear text dictated by routes (for example drivngh from Cancun to Playa del Carmen), so information for a given place you might want to visit might start at the bottom of a left page and run over the next without the name place ever making it to the top of the page. Places to dine, stay or shop would haphazardly fall wherever the text put them, never in sections starting a page top or in any consistent structural order. Perhaps the idea was to list everything in a rambling travelogue, place drifting into place running north to south, east to west, broken down by region. I just thought it made the book frustratingly inflexible and to idiosyncratic.   By the way, why on earth produce a guide book for use in the tropics on cheap uncoated paper? Perhaps because they publishers decided to give the traveler only 4 pages of photographs. This book really absorbed moisture and seemed to get heavier and heavier! I know that sounds silly but simple details like trying to turn a page when they seem to cling together in the humidity added to my wondering about the wisdom behind this book.   The 'hidden" part, the supposed trump card of this guide is of dubious merit. The "hidden" discoveries were few and far between, disappointing on the odd occasion I checked them out (I stopped after realizing that they weren't so special) and just not strong enough to hang the (title) concept of a travel book (series). Indeed  I often found the 2004 version very dated and in the course of traveling, made far more interesting discoveries of my own. By contrast, "The Rough Guide" and "Top 10", both thin compact picture filled books with plenty of good maps and guides also contained far more recommendations of places to eat, stay and visit in a concise, coherent well layed out and easier to navigate manner that "Hidden Cancun & Yucatan" lacks. My girlfrined and I felt that they both immensely increased our interest in visiting various restaurants, Mayan sites, colonial towns, beaches, churches etc... In conjunction with the "Cadogan Yucatan" we were very well informed culturally, historically, visually and geographically. The 2 small pocket guides were excellent for walking about with when we left "Cadogan" and "Hidden" in the car - though we'd often bring "Cadogan" with us anyway because we couldn't stop reading it.   Another thing that I found grating and contrary to the "hidden" concept was the authors occasional statements of his personal preferences in side bars. Normally it's great to get another traveler's insights, but personally I found the actual comments annoying. For example, I strongly question how a writer appealing to people seeking out hidden and undiscovered corners of the Yucatan can suggest that Palya del Carmen's beach is his favorite on the Mayan Riviera. Maybe it was different when he was last there a couple of years ago. Another dated reference (or just downright crass) was his reference to the actual pueblo of Tulum as "a drab eye-blink off the highway, with a few stores, a taco shop and a palapa-roofed church". Instead we are treated to the authors name dropping of personalities he's rubbed shoulders with at Maya Tulum, a chic place on the beach. In fact the pueblo of Tulum is a fast growing little town with an impressively paved main street with many interesting shops including a large "Misik Artesanias" (another smaller one is on the beach) and the adjoining palapa-roofed "Charlie's". There are a couple of big bank branches (HSBC and Banamex) with ATM machines, a couple of laundromats, an excellent large supermarket at the entrance to town (opposite the road down to the beach). Get my point? This is a fast growing town that is trying to make itself interesting and attractive without making itself into another souless eurotrash hole like Palaye del Carmen. How long ago did Richard Harris write his review? Is he aware that a 4 lane road is being constructed between Tulum and Coba (and onto Valladolid) and an international airport in pre-construction there? This may be a particularly dramatic place for change but my point is that the book was often out of date and unfocused 
 The mystery is enjoyable but once that is lifted and you find out the real truth about Goriot and Eugene, who cares?! I like Vautrin-he is very interesting but the weird old man and the young punk has to go. The daughters are morally disgusting. I heard an English Professor say that this novel is a lesson not to have children-clearly misunderstood 
 Forced Ranking, which was forced reading from my Company's VP, was perhaps the poorest example of published material I have had the displeasure to read. My Calculus textbooks had more substance.  How Dick Grote could take 10 pages of material and repeat himself enough to make it last over 100 pages is the only amazing thing about this book 
 I ordered the Ergo Lounger.  When I arrived, I was shocked to find that I could barely lift the box that it came in. I wanted to move it to another room to unpack.  This was supposed to be lightweight "aluminum" but the box clearly said "steel."  I did NOT want one that would rust because I intended to carry it to the beach to use it.  I actually called the Manufacturer (they provided a toll free number) several times.  Never did they answer the phone, nor did they ever return any of my calls.  So I could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not.  The lounger itself seemed pretty nice, just too heavy and probably would rust soon 
 The "statistics" this book cites are more than misleading and do not reflect even a moderatly informed scientific opinion.  Schzophrenia and bipolar disorder have certainly been proven to be caused by brain abnormalities as have many other illnesses. To opine that psychiatry and successful treatment of these life-threatening conditions are some sort of huge hoax is akin to claiming that there's no such thing as mental illness. The medications available to treat major mental illness can be the difference between a happy, productive life, and a life of debilitating violence, despair, and death.  The authors' child-like descriptions of medical testing and - believe it or not - their entire section describing the personality of all pschiatrists (they are evidently all controlling, evil powermongers) - only serve to reinforce the authors' idiocy. Certainly, medical professionals have at times been responsible for misprescribing drugs - but to conclude that all psychopharmaceuticals are evil or that all psychiatrists are frauds is laughable.  I wonder if anyone's thought of suing the authors for the damage the book's lies may have caused in their own or a loved one's life 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 Since God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.  When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.  Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.  So pain is God's megaphone.  If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.  Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.  But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to "plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls."      Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?  Given mankind's painful existence, "an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous."  God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed.  Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - "What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?"  One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.  Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?  I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.  Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God's viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love.  In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as "damn nonsense."  Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.  Lewis's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined.  Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin.  Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception.  The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability.  Abused children typically grow up to be abusers.  In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23.  Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will.  Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop.  In most people it remains largely dormant.  Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability.  Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.  Lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution.  Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man's appearance on Earth.  Somehow, the perfectly good "Paradisal Man" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan.  Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.  Lewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic.  Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation.  I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life.  The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity.  According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God.  I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug.  I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible.  Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ.  I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender.  Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan's ultimate deception.  But I have also experienced Satan within myself.  If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan.  I know the difference.  I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.  I am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound.  In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth:  It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence.  This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control.  There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness.  As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain.  The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents.  What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything.  Satan can therefore be described as "God's self-ignorance."  Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical.  C. S. Lewis tells us that "it is not God's purpose that we should go back into that old identity."  I think I agree with him on this point.  Mankind's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.

 Yuck.  This book was totally boring.  Well, maybe you'll like it if you're, like, 7 or 8 years old or something.   Not only is it totally boring, but poorly written.  Which surprised me because Ann M. Martin is  certainly not a bad writer!  I'm really glad she left the BSC and started  writing a new series about them.  The BSC books are soo boring and  childish.  Please- a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog  runs loose for 2 seconds.  Don't waste your time reading the BSC books.   They are all pretty dumb 
 I am supposed to get 16th edition, instead I received 15th edition. The book was completely changed from the previuos editio 
 This book is complete rubbish. It is a scathing indictment of our university system and an argument against tenor.  If my son or daughter came home spewing this tripe I would pull them immediately.    I surmise that maybe his [author] darkest day was in 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell. In fact, the only praise I remember in the book was for the Chinese over some clever anti-Western words they used in their showcase film.  I think he pines for "agrarian reformers" like Che (wink...wink).  The author is adamantly opposed to optimism (of any kind) and his main criticism of Disney comes from their inability to show history at its worst moments.  I think he would be unsatisfied with a dark ride reliving the grimmest moments of US history.  My favorite trick of his is when he uses quotations around words like "free market".  I think this is code to demonstrate to his smug friends his disdain for free enterprise and industry.  He almost writes/types the words "nuclear family" angrily!   It is sad.  He is sad.  Finally, you should never trust someone who writes about pop culture who places an AT-AT on Endor.    
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 Peter Fonda and Kurt Russell surfing a wave down a Los Angeles reservoir is not cool, does not make this movie worth a look, good God, that scene stinks. P-U. Campy. This movie is a mess. A horribly made sequel. So bad it actually tarnishes the reputation of the original 
 I was surprised that Roshumba Williams, who is a beautiful woman, would be part of this kind of book. I seemed like someone who did'nt know much about modeling wrote this, and Roshumba put her name on it. There arn't even any pictures of her inside, no pictures at all 
  In the bokk Space Station Seventh grade by Jerry Spinelli a kid named jason wants to build a space station.Ididnt really like this book because the author made the main idea hard to present.I thought that the author jumped around from one subject to another.For example one chapter was talking about football then the next was about halloween.The author focuses on other subjects and doesn't realizes theres not enought infiormation about the main idea  
 i struggled to get past the first 150 pages of this pile of words.  too bad the thing only runs 270 pages or so, because alan furst has become a first-rate cure for insomnia 
 I really had a lot of fun for the first month I owned it. Two AA batteries lasted almost one month. Compared with other rechargeable models, this one was fairly cheap. But after 5 months, now, it's so annoying that I have to change batteries every 3 days! How come a toothbrush eats up power so crazy?! I'm thinking of buying a rechargeable toothbrush. 
 My son loved this toy at christmas, however in less than an hour it was broken. The gears had stripped on one side, and it never made it out of the house.  Now, amazon.com was very good in saying they would send another...I sent the broken back...but the toy was on back order until April, 06.  I waited, at the request of my 8 year old son who wanted it so badly...the time came and went...the only way I knew what was going on was by my contacting them...they never bothered to let me know of any problems with the order...but always apologetic.  I finally asked for a refund in April because they told me it was still not available....now I'm stuck with the battery pack that doesn't go with anything else....and after reading all the other reviews, I wouldn't chance getting another one, even though my son did love it.    
 These authors, and this book (in an earlier edition) were the first wave of today's spam onlsaught.  If you need immigration information, please look elsewhere.  If you -really- want this book, please buy the used copy.  In the perusing of it that I've done, I found it to be not entirely uninformative, but I certainly wouldn't give it accolades, and, given it (and its authors') background, I wouldn't pay money for it if you held a gun to my head.  Go ahead: type "Canter and Siebel" into Google, and see what you get 
 As a Japanese Horror film enthusiast, I was very disappointed. I feel it is a blatant rip-off of The Grudge/ Ju On. Parts of it are very scary, but it really made no sense. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this DVD and watched it on On Demand Cable, instead. Blah... 
 I tried to read this book.  It's very negative.  I am almost sorry that I bought it.  It's hard to believe that a guy who spent 30 years (I think its 30 years) of his life in Eckankar would write a book against it.  Ford doesn't do anyone any good by exposing the "weak links" of Eckankar.  It doesn't matter if Paul Twitchell invented some history because 1) all the major precepts of Eckankar are true making Eckankar the strong religion it is today and 2)Whatever Paul did invent, he did for the ECK 
 I love these kinds of books as much as I love all conspiracy theories, even though I have never found one that rings true.  Most serious, professional academics dismiss easily this sort of thing for lack of evidence.  Compare the Newport Tower and the knight's grave marker in Massachusetts (?).    Still, it's fun.  Maybe it's true or has some truth associated with it.  There is so much new archeology being done all over the world that I HOPE it's true.  Poor Mr. Bradley would like so much to be taken seriously and get the recognition he thinks he deserves.  He does not have the credentials, though, and seems to have missed his opportunity to get them in the academic world.    Really, I hope someone proves him right.  Living in the middle of North America -- on the Great Lakes -- this is fun stuff 
 If you've read anything by any anti-American writer anywhere, you've read this book.  All the leftwing cliches and bogeymen -- er, bogeypersons -- are all here.  Corporate America -- you know, those people who create our jobs and make the things we like to have -- is "evil."  George Bush is a "terrorist."  We love to kill those "innocent people" who let Al Qaeda train its members in their countries.  We're in Iraq "illegally."  To be truly human, one must oppose the United States.    Yeah, yeah, blah, blah -- Professor Jensen obviously doesn't know what these words mean.  If even one tenth of what Professor Jensen (he "teaches" -- er, indoctrinates, at the University of Texas) says in this book were true, he'd be in jail, which is exactly where his heroes Fidel Castro and Hugo "I hugged Cindy Sheehan" Chavez put people who practice dissent in _their_ countries.  
 Feisal Abdul Rauf is an honest and decent man who sincerely believes what he writes. He has an excellent reputation, well deserved.  Having said that, I must now address what he has written.  Part of the book's title is, "A New Vision for Muslims and the West." Unfortunately, that's all it is, a vision, a fairy tale told to those who want to believe it.  The dark and sinister forces who are radical Islamists will have none of it, and if we are lulled into complacency, the events of 9/11 will become repeated events.  Like it or not, the hardliner Islamists are at war with the West, where the objective is total world conquest, where everyone either becomes a Muslim or he dies (the exceptions being Jews and Christians who, as People of the Book, will be treated as second class citizens).  What Raef refuses to acknowledge is that there are earlier verses in the Qur'an that _do_ preach peace and tolerance....but their are the later verses calling for subjugation and death to the infidel. Islamic scholars have decided that the later verses abrogate (trump) the earlier ones.  For this reason, in my opinion, the book misleads and is fatally flawed 
 My son is 5 years old and a big fan of pirates toys. When I saw the box I was extremely impressed with the display. The box advised that the toy was for kids 6 and older.   The ship is a "Lego" type structure requiring some assembly. As I have had prior experience assembling Lego models I felt I was up to the task. What I did learn is this definitely isn't the same quality as a Lego product as the pieces would not lock together. Upon assembling the main structure, the pieces would snap out of place with out warning.   After about 20 minutes of stress trying to keep the structure intact during the assembly process, I decided it was time to take a break. Returned 20 minutes later, and the portion of the structure that I was able to lock the pieces together had again started to fall-apart.  I proceeded to shove the pieces back in the box and rush it back to the department store for a refund.   Maybe I have the patience of a 6 year old, but I can't see my 5 year old enjoying playing with a toy which collapses when moved.   Pros: Box and packaging is impressive. The look and feel of the pieces is very detailed   Cons Instructions could be clearer. Although the Lego concept isn't difficult, a lot of trial and error is required.  Quality control is not what I'm used to. Son never had a chance to play with this item as it was never assembled.  I replaced it with the playmobil pirate ship and my son has really enjoyed playing with this product 
 Shangri La, that heaven on earth, is under attack. It's the 1960s, and the Chinese army is at the height of its ideological zeal for the Cultural Revolution. Originally, that army was marching against native Tibetan culture, in an attempt at forced assimilation of the disputed territory. Legend, then clues to that edenic valley begin to emerge, and then ...  I won't spoil the story. One family leads the hunt for Shangri La: a corrupt General Zhang, a son burning with missionary zeal for the revolution, and a daughter with quiet doubts about the party. A character from Hilton's original story learns of the threat, and leaves Shangri La to avert the threat. Leaving, of course, is a death sentence unless he returns soon enough, but the hero puts the safety of Shangri La ahead of his own.  This post-hoc collaboration never really captured my imagination. The writing is good enough, except for an especially magical resolution to the threat. I don't see it as a sequel, so much as an unrelated story in the same setting. That could have been good, but the characters never enticed me. The plot was very plain, an intellectual dead end: things happen, they're resolved, and that's it. Nothing more to think about.   Some people seem to this one - just not me.  //wiredweir 
 I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book 
 This badly-written, poorly-conceived excuse for a novel makes me ashamed to admit liking Piers Anthony's work.  Ever.  It reads as though written and edited by a classroom of first-graders.  Except that first-graders are generally more imaginative.  This derivative drivel is... self-gratification splashed onto a page, ready for unwary readers.  The characters are flat, the plot is trite, and the writing itself is so incredibly clumsy it made me wince just reading the first page 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 I bought this book and Astral Dynamic.  The beginning of the book is interesting, it is guiding you, but unfortunately the rest of the book is not so orginal or interesting. The style is bland, filled with fuzzy mystical terms, redundancies, and personal experiences that seem a bit contrived. The book is also overly long because of it's attempt to be an explain-all of the OOB phenomenon.  And author is unsure about himself, which is a weakness of this book 
 Cannot order these as they do not say what small, medium or large=....I have a 6 year olde and is 60#'s so do I buy a medium or a large...I hate this when I want  something and there is not enough information.. 
 Any book based on the premise that the Rosenbergs were innocent, deserving of beatification, victims of awful America, is not going to date well.  1977, I suppose, was a kind of high-water mark for that sort of thinking.  If you have a friend who thinks Stalin was unfairly maligned, this may be the book for him.  I was forced to read this book cover to cover by a vindictive college professor who assigned it to me (and me alone) as the subject for a class writing project.  I loathed every minute of it.    From its doctrinaire anti-anti-communist, anti-Americanism; its sub-Dos Passos modernism; its sophomoric delight in scatology (giggle, giggle, tee hee, Nixon has sex with Ethel Rosenberg and is then anally raped by Uncle Sam).  There are no fully-formed characters, just endless making of puerile political points.  Nixon-bad.  Time Magazine-bad.  America-bad.  Ethel Rosenberg-saint and martyr.    Its like a bad book treatment of a very bad Ken Russell movie.  I'd rather eat jagged metal bits than be forced to read this pompous, train-wreck of a book ever again 
 As a prosecutor, I was very interested in reading this book.  I had seen an interview with the author and read several customer reviews.  I am disappointed.  I understand that the author apparently lived a fairly priveleged life prior to working as an Assistant D.A., and says as much early in the book.  I would assume, however, that her $100,000 education would have helped develop a more grammatically correct writing style.  The errors in grammar and spelling were distracting at times and made for a less than smooth read.  Additionally, though I do not prosecute in the Bronx, and am sure there is a steep learning curve, five years as an Assistant D.A. hardly creates an expertise in any area.  The "cop speak" throughout the book, and the drama with which the stories are told suggest a motive more in line with personal promotion than delivery of insight.  This may explain the numerous T.V. appearances, etc.  The author may be a good lawyer and may have been a good Assistant D.A., but the book does not convey that.  Finally, the stories told are important ones to tell, and all should have some exposure to what man is willing to do to one another, especially the most vulnerable.  I just wish the book's focus was more on them and less on the author's gallant fight for those unable to fight for themselves, at least for five years.         
 This quite possibly is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Our company tried to read/study this together and we only made it 1/2 way through because of the poorly written and completely unapplicable content.  I generally don't write bad reviews of products, but this is one I had to tell people about 
 I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was "different", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed 
 I am in a Master's program in Science and Religion. The facts are, White was the first president of Cornell University. Cornell was the first secular institution of higher learning in the US. White was resisted because of his desire to make the University purely secular; in response he wrote this polemic specifically against religion. He misrepresents history on many counts. For example, he quotes the mythical account of Columbus' alleged conversation with Ferdinand and Isabella about sailing to the New World to show the earth is round. I was taught that myth in grade school, only realizing in the last few months that this is a fable. Washington Irving is the one that made the story up about Columbus, White quoted him, and the fable has been perpetrated since. White has been used to perpetuate the myth that the Christian Church held that the earth is flat, which is again completely false. No serious historian of science today accepts the conflict thesis between science and religion, and no one in the field accepts White as anything more than historical curiosity. While the book might inflame people already predisposed to attack religion, serious investigators about the relationships between science and religion would do better to read real historians such as John Hedley Brooke, David Lindbergh and Ronald Numbers, or Dennis Danielson. The nuances in historical episodes such as the Galileo affair, who by the way was never tortured, are much more complex than the simplistic parrot talk usually perpetuated about these subjects.  
 I expected to find this book stimulating and informative, but came away feeling that Dennett is vastly overrated and quite ordinary in his thought process, logical skills, and writing.  This book does not explain or offer a theory on -- as its title promises -- what consciousness is; it merely offers a lot of random observations on and stories about consciousness.  Dennett seems to start everything he writes somewhere in the middle of a conversation he has been having with himself; he doesn't know how to properly introduce a topic to the reader.  He begins the book not with an overview of his subject or a presentation of a thesis, but with a chapter on hallucinations -- a very specific area of consciousness.  I indulged it with the expectation that it would provide an entry point into a broader argument he wished to advance; instead it was just the first in a random string of narratives.    I suggest that in lieu of Dennett's writings on consciousness, one read John Searle or Robert Ornstein.  Or if you want an engaging, conversational style of writing on the subject, look into Oliver Sacks.   
 Dragonlance is my favorite campaign setting. I have read the Dragonlance Campaign Setting d20 manual, and despite its poor reviews, I thought it was still useful, and was not sadden by the loss of money. This book is completely different.  	The biggest problem with the Age of Mortals, is the constant repetition. The book relates the history of the Dragonlance setting from the end of the Chaos War to the death of Takhisis, and the sacrifice of Paladine. The story itself is rather interesting, but it was already written in the main Dragonlance Campaign Setting book. As if repeating it once was not enough, the authors decided to place the story in several places of the book. The story is written in the introduction. The story is repeated in the beginning of the chapter on religion. The book also has a time table of events, which tells the same tale with the slight difference of separating events by the years on which the event took place. Further, on almost every character profile presented in the book, parts of the story were repeated again.  The art also is in need of repair. It isn't so much that the quality of the drawings is poor, as the quantity is. There are very few pictures compared to that of a typical roleplaying manual. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but there is obvious room for the pictures in the book. There are huge gaps at the end of each chapter, where there is nothing but blank page. This space could have easily been occupied by a picture or two. Had the book cut down on the repetitive story, even more room could have been made for art work. To top the space issues, the problem of the first d20 Dragonlance book was not corrected. This book still has inch thick margins.  The meat of the book lies in the few prestige classes presented. There is also a page of feats, and a couple pages of spells. The balance of the spells and feats is in question, but since I have not yet gotten a chance to use any of them, it would be unfair of me to grade them on their usability. Still even if all the spells and feats were the best feats and prestige classes ever written, this one chapter would not be enough to make up for the poor planning of the rest of the book.  There is a chapter on towns, cities, and strongholds. This is by far the best chapter in the book, but a few of the descriptions of the cities repeat larger parts of the main story. This wouldn't be so much of problem if it weren't for the boredom of having read the story several times already. This chapter had a major flaw. It doesn't have enough maps. Only three cities, or so, actually had a map of the city. Further, this chapter would have been helped greatly had it contained a map of the world, which showed the location of each city in the chapter. The only world map in this book contained directions of seasonal winds, followed by a small description of weather and climate.  There is a chapter of descriptions, which seems to say that the Dragonlance setting has the same main qualities of any other Dungeons and Dragons setting. This Chapter talked about the weather and the people. The only thing new was a small description of a few plants, and their nativity in Dragonlance. It isn't really important to the average gamer, but to someone who likes the poetry of Dragonlance, they might have some uses.  The religion Chapter describes each deity and their new role in the world. The Dragonlance Campaign Setting book already listed the deities. Thus, it was another disappointment that the deities were described again. Luckily a few of the descriptions had insight into what the deities planned for the future, instead of just telling who the deity was.   The structure of the book was also poor. It was rather annoying reading about a race description or a city description and then moving strait into a character profile. Why put Goldmoon's profile in the introduction of the religion Chapter? There really should have been a "Hero" chapter of the book, which contained all the character profiles instead of plugging them into random sections of the book. By eliminating the unused space, and the repetition of this book, the publishers could have made a decent soft cover book, and lowered the price by a good 10 to 15 dollars. Even with Amazons low prices, this book isn't worth the money.  
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 This movie has nothing to do with a house. Its really just a low budget rape porn. I tossed it in the trash about 20 minutes into it. 
 In Piano Tuner, Daniel Mason (an American medical student who went to Myanmar to find himself), presents a clear picture of a liberal Englishman in the late 19th century, who travels to Burma to repair a piano. He apparently hated himself and his culture so much that, within weeks of arriving in exotic colonial Burma, he craves for a new identity as a Burmese. Without any hesitation, he cheats on his wife (exotic Asian women are so sexy), abandons his previous life, and rebels against the British authorities in Burma.  This genre is very old and quiet stale. Ever since Europeans "discovered" Asia, there have been books about going to the orient and finding meaning in a life that was meaningless in Europe. Daniel Mason trudges down this weary path once more one hundred years later.  Not only does he spin out an old formula, he does so with very little sophistication. In the novel, a Burmese woman accuses the English newspapers of caricaturing local women as dancing girls and men as barbarians. Mr. Mason does the same thing in his novel. There is not one Burmese male character in the novel who is intelligent or endearing, and the one Burmese female character has a fetish for European men. She can't get enough of them.  A dominant character in the book is an English doctor (Mr. Mason's fantasy alter ego?) who is a lover of the arts, a scientist and a thoroughly decent chap. This doctor is protecting the region from British aggression, studying local flora and fauna, saving lives of the Burmese with his medical ingenuity, and truly appreciating the beauty of the country.  While Mr. Mason seems to oppose the military aggression and rule that the British used in that part of the world, he openly endorses the idea of a white savior doctor who can teach the locals how to live in a civilized manner. This is so old, that it hurts me to write about it.  
 The book was poorly written.  There was too much emphasis on tiny characteristics of the characters and not enough focus on Christianity.  It is supposed to be a story about finding God, and if it is, then I missed that point.  The characters have no depth and it is hard to get into, for the plot is too dumb.  I don't like to use childish language, but I can find no other to describe my disappointment.  There was no suspence to the plot, with a very predictable ending.  Please, save your money, borrow it from the library 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 this toy is fun,  but it breaks very easily.  It lasted about a day.  then the string broke 
 If you have 10 million dollars and you are losing 100 thousand dollars a day, then this book might be helpful. If you are not a millionaire, then this book is not for you. I can give you better advice on how to get rich than Trump. I understand he knows more than i do, however, he does not share a damn thing with you in his book 
 I expected great things from Scarling!! the first Album was so good i couldnt wait for the next!!! I was not let down!! it was great, i listen to it all the time!!! this album wont leave my CD player for a long time!!! its simply beautiful! 
 The pictures are great, but the explanations are lacking.  In doing faux finishes it is imperative to know what colors and types of paints to be used., this book did not offer too much of that.  Very disappointing. A waste of money 
 "Omerta" is an unfortunate jumble of characters, tedious plot lines and lazy writing. The largely unoriginal mafia intrigue is appealing on some easy-reading level, but mostly everything about this book is phony, overwrought and dull. The most disappointing thing to me, a first-time Puzo reader, was that the characters did not have histories so much as they had stage personas. The smooth, calculating hero who can't bring himself to kill women. The vicious South American druglord who has the morals of a spider. The happy-go-lucky hitmen twin brothers who live like underworld yuppies but meet a terrible end. Trite, trite, trite.

 This is one of so many movies that is foolishly and blindly overrated.  Citizen Kane is also on that list.  It has some drama to it, but the lack of realism turns it into a silly movie.  In the big finish, the great triumph of the Church and the little man, Brando simply gets up from a beating and walks on his own two feet to report to work.  What idiocy.  What can that solve.  Absolutely nothing.  And yet the premise of the movie is that by walking to work, Brando is taking the corrupt union leadership down.  Some idiot in the background makes it clear, just in case we didn't get the point, by saying "now we can run the union on the up and up".  Haha, what a joke.  Brando's little walk at the end is purely symbolic and will do not a damn thing to change the union leadership.  It's just a Hollywood happy ending, a triumph of good over evil, of non-violence over murder.  Sure.  Actually a triumph of Hollywood silliness over honest standards of truth and sense in movies.  As pure entertainment, it falls short too.  There is just too much depression and futility.  It's not worth the agita.  And it is all wrapped up so nicely at the end, isn't it.  If you have any sense at all you realize that the mob will kill Brando soon enough, so what difference does it make that he is allowed to work one day?  None at all.  He's dead meat.  What kind of happy garbage are we being fed 
 Having read several CS books, this one breaks no new ground.  Had this  book come out five years ago, it would have been more useful.  As is, the  book seems terribly dated and not especially enlightening.  If you've read  nothing about customer sat, then this book is a good read 
 I really loved the first two books in Fforde's Thursday Next series.  Therefore, I was extremely disappointed in "The Well of Lost Plots."  I literally could not finish it.  I always have a pile of books by my bed and the call of another author was just too great.  I abandoned this book on about page 150.  I was mired in cleverness and inside book jokes.  Other reviewers have noted that this book takes place almost entirely inside the world of books.  I think that may be the problem. There's no connection to the characters in the Outland or the previous storylines.  Also, I began this book within a day of finishing "Lost in a Good Book"; maybe I just needed a break.  Thursday Next is my hero and I wanted to read more about her.  I just couldn't maintain my interest in the plot -- or lack thereof. I'm going to try the fourth book in the series, upon the recommendation of one of the reviewers, but I found this book to be considerably less satisfying than the first two. Be forewarned.  
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 OH please only heard bit and pieces, and that was enough leave it up to the big kids this was a bad idea gone very bad.  Who is ever gonna remenbers any of these youngsters?  Most of thier voices have not even matured yet. 
 Edelman's criticisms of index mutual funds are nonsense. Most blatantly, he sets up a false straw dummy, by saying that index funds are claimed to have ZERO trading costs. Rubbish! NO proponent of these has ever said that. Starting with the largest, Vanguard. All providers of index funds (and Exchange Traded Funds) assert that they have trading costs. Edelman surely knows this, yet he goes on to misrepresent index funds. In order to "refute" the "claim" by saying that they do indeed incur these costs. Neophyte readers without any background in financial matters might be taken in. It shows clearly the type of audience that he is aiming at.  Yes, index funds have trading costs. But so do actively managed funds. And the latter almost always do much higher trading. Reflected in the overheads. Index funds have expense ratios (overheads) of around 0.1-0.4%. Active funds are from 0.9-2% or more.  Another claim he makes is that index funds do mechanical buying and selling, without having a human actively consider these decisions. Yet this is a strength of index funds, not a weakness. When an active fund buys or sells, it could be right or wrong. It is not a given that the active fund will even be correct on average. And the current price of a stock reflects this give and take, across all active trading.   Edelman also says that when you buy an index fund, you could get hit with capital gains, if the fund sells stocks with large gains. But the low trading (=long holding periods) of an index fund, mitigates against this. Active funds are more likely to hit you with capital gains, because they trade much more frequently.  The strongest point he makes about index funds is that in a market downturn, they should underperform active funds. Because index funds must stay fully invested, whereas an active fund can have a cash position that cushions the fall in its stocks.   Intellectually, this is the most plausible scenario for an active fund to outperform an index.  But hey, you know what? In the last US bear market, 2000-2, the main index funds still outperformed most of the large active funds. (Where both types invested across the market.) It turns out there is no guarantee that an active fund's cash position is sufficient to overcome a bad choice of stocks, whose prices fall more than the market averages. This 3rd edition was written in 2003, yet there is no reference to these events. Edelman did not update his remarks from the earlier editions. Sloppy.  He also quotes Forbes as deprecating on index funds. Wrong. Over the last 20 years, Forbes has consistently written favourably on these. Because the Forbes fund surveys and associated advice look approvingly on low overhead (expense ratio). As they have put it several times, the overhead is the most consistent thing you know about any fund, in bull or bear markets. Their surveys have shown that index funds outperform most active funds 
 This book depends upon (count'em) five works from the nineteenth century, all of which have been debunked by scholars. It is a wonderful fantasy. If you like reading fantasy, and can accept it as such, it will be a great book for one to read.   However, ask yourself what has happened to Hal Lindsey in the last 36 years: he made a fortune, now owns several homes and luxury cars. Strange way, don't you think, for one to show his belief that the end is near 
 I found this book to be annoyingly simplistic.  The illustrations - full color photographs - are nice enough but the text leaves a lot to be desired.    For example, the book gives three steps for sewing in a zipper, which might be enough if they told you whether to use thread or yarn for the backstitching into place (the picture seems to show them using yarn but it's not really clear), whether or not to remove the backstitching (the picture of the finished garment appears to show the (rather sloppy)backstitching still in place.  The third step is to slip stitch the edge of the zipper into place...again, no mention of whether to use the yarn or matching thread, though it would appear to be embroidery floss.  Kitchenering is shown briefly (and not explained very well) but is called "Grafting by Sewing," so a newcomer to knitting wouldn't know what to look for in this book when confronted with the term "Kitchener" in a pattern and, alternatively, when faced with the term "Kitchener" in a pattern wouldn't know that this was the method they might have seen in this book called "Grafting by Sewing."  I'm sure there are better books on finishing techniques than this one 
 I would rate this book at 0 stars if I could, but 1 star is the minimum. Just think about the fact that this book has an infinite number of pages which narrate the history of car audio, the first amplifiers and how they worked, the first transistors,bla bla bla. - All of this without explaining some usefull information such as wire connections, amp channel manipulation, etc. I bought this book but I was very disappointed. I read a lot of books about auto audio, and I must say that this book is not usefull at all, especially to beginners. Dont repeat my mistake by buying this book 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 After the brilliant "Going After Cacciato," this book severely disappointed me.  The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue hollow and unbelievable, and the plot laughable.  I had a hard time swallowing just about every scene.  I didn't like Tom, and not because he was obnoxious, but because he was such a broad stereotype with no depth.  R. Russo created an equally obnoxious protagonist (also a professor) in "Straight Man" who did some pretty loony things, yet I loved that book.  It rang true.  This book does not.  By the end, I did not cheer, I did not hiss.  I found I just didn't care one way or another for any of the characters 
 I bought this fountain because it is advertised to hold 6L / 216 oz.  It does not.  This fountain, when filled per the manufacturer's recommendations to 1/2 inch below the rim, only holds ~160 oz.  In this state, it is still possible to move it from the sink to the floor with minimal spilling.  If you fill it on the floor, and fill it to the very rim (including the clear reservoir and the top fountain reservoir), the fountain maxes out at ~190 oz, anymore and it promptly spills over the edge.  That's only ~5 L.  I called this to Petmate's attention, who did nothing... I even offered to send them a video demonstrating this and they ignored it.  If you buy this thinking it holds what they say, be forewarned that it does not 
 Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
  Sylvia Browne claims to be of God and to have gone to the other side or Heaven but there are many things she says in her book that just don't make since.She says when she went to the other side she saw everyone worshipping together(Jews,Hindus,Buddas,Catholics,Muslims,etc.)Do you really think that in Heaven everyone will be worshipping other gods?She also says that instead of sex there will be merging where you experience the other person's feelings(joy,sorrow,etc.)and you will experience the ultimate bliss.In the book of Revelation it says God will take away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more sorrow or pain for the former things have passed away.Also if a person experiences the highest form of bliss by merging, it would seem they would want to be merging all of the time.The highest form of bliss you can and want to achieve is being in the presence of God in Heaven.She also says everyone one the other side has an imperfection(her spirit guide has a chipped tooth).Paul says we will all be in Heaven in our perfect spiritual bodies 
 I was raised Christian, but very recently have been actively pracicing Buddhism. Although I have rejected many of the belifs from Christian church, I am still trying to reconcile my Christian upbringing with Buddhism. I read Living Buddha, Living Christ a while ago and although the message was simplistic, I enjoyed the book. I was expecting further discussion of Christianity and Buddhism in Going Home, but was dissapointed that it was a disjointed series of dharma talks with the difficult to understand, circular language that many Buddhism books contain and little real content on Christianity and Buddhism

 Leland's attempt to document this history of the concept of hip in America is valient, but his thesis is fault at best. He tried to say that every chapter of the history of hip is related...and its not 
 What a lovely book this is, full of happy blond children lavishly photographed amidst charmingly rustic settings. However, the knitwear they're modeling, although clean-lined and attractive, isn't "Celtic" at all. Yes, there is one Aran-ish tunic in the collection, but unless you are a thirteen-year-old, it won't fit you. A terrific disappointment 
 There's not too much I can offer here, since I found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie.  A lot of nice shots of the robots in this, and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings.  I'm sure there has been some debate over the use of Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie, but that's not something that I think really applies to my overall sense of the film.  I am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema.  A lot of the camera angles, costumes, the shapes of the robots and weapons, all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore, and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction, as silly as they may look to us today.  But this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane.  There are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future, and because of that they're not often harked upon.  Instead, this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments, a spiffy sidekick, and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating.  This movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance. 
 I'm criticizing Carver with the utmost deference, because I hold the man in the highest regard and strive to write like him.  I can't say enough good things about his short stories (My favorite is A Small, Good Thing), which manage to say so much with so few pages.  His poems, however, are not as good as his short stories.  They lack the continuity of his stories, as well as the practiced craft of more experienced poets.  The line changes seem awkward, and there is not a consistent theme in each sub-collection.  These poems are not meant to be read by poetry afficionados, but by precocious teenagers who need a little encouragement to start writing for themselves.  Carver's stories should be required reading for any human being, but if you like to read poems about the same themes, check out Carl Dennis or Tony Hoagland 
 I agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long.  Genetic Algorithms are a great programming tool, and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately, but this book had a lot of redundant information.  If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so.  Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized.  Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that.  I think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book. 
 It is difficult to read and make sense of the facts in this book. The  history of the beer style is hard to follow. Information is presented in a  scattered fashion, and ranges from extreme detail in some areas to glossing  over other points 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 This book, authored by women, illustrates 21 positions in which the man goes down on the woman and zero positions in which the woman goes down on the man. (Unless you count the single illustration of 69, in which case this book illustrates 22 positions in which the man goes down on the woman and one in which the woman goes down on the man.) To add insult to injury, in a few of the illustrations in which the man goes down on the woman, the man appears to be licking the woman's anus. In short, as a man I don't feel that this book has my best interests at heart. 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order

 Breath-taking! I have worked and traveled in  Russia  and the CIS over  the past ten years and I am reminded of the story of the two scientists who went to the seashore to discover what a beach was. The first scientist observed the waves and tides pounding the rocks and said, "Aha! Big rocks grind together to make smaller and smaller rocks until we get some pretty grains of sand!"   The second scientist went to the beach with a pair of tweezers and a magnifying glass, and spent all day selecting grains of sand according to his preference of shape, size, weight and color. Then he hauled his sand collection to his laboratory and began to categorize and cross-compare each grain of sand with the grains of sand from foreign country's  beaches until he felt he had enough data to write a book about how large Russian rocks preyed on small Russian rocks and how pretty pieces of Russian sand were rare; and that the pretty pieces were always buried in the mud of a Gulag and how all the rest of the sand grains had to hide the audacity to strive to be beautiful - which could somehow provoked the envy of the big rocks into oppressing the sand grains.   In the end, his book was full of clever sophistry and cynical blame for the majority of the Russian sand grains wanting to be beautiful. He concocted his own "Cosmic Law" which stated that Russian sand grains were either content to live in dreary, collective layers because they did not want to be envied by other Russian sand grains who were afraid of the bigger rocks -or that all Russian sand grains should strive to rise to the top where they could hide under new "Laws" which would protect them from learning responsibility and from thinking for themselves; thus keeping all the grains of sand under "soft" control and diverted from trying to be better sand-grain souls.  I hesitate to use a four letter word to describe the author's covertly angry, bitter and abusive criticism of the evolving and talented  Russian people who have, after several hundred years only just begun experiencing the decency of a leader from their very own country. (Even Stalin was Georgian), but so, for the opportunity for the discerning sociologist to experience and study a stunning and ingenious example of "Sophistry",  I shall give this book one star. The thundering silence of any encouraging word and the breathtaking jealousy of the re-emerging, responsible podvig of the Russian people will become self evident to students of ignorance versus spirited elan 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 This would have to rank as one of the worst movies of all time. Overlong, boring, dreadful acting, embarrassing  screenplay. By the time you get to the battle sequence (meant to be the movie's centrepiece) you're so bored that you don't care what happens to any of the main characters. In fact, you end up hoping all the main characters die quickly so this pathetic movie will end. But I did find it very funny to listen to the dreadful dialogue, so at least I got some amusement from it.  I actually found the battle scenes quite disrespectful to the memory of the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor. Scenes of people dying horribly using modern-cinema realism and gore was quite repulsive and offensive. I'm surprise Michael Bay was allowed to get away with it. As I watched the gore-fest that is the battle, I wondered what those people who died that day would think of the way their deaths were portrayed - like some ghoulish freakshow for us 60 years later to watch and say with a morbid smile on our face ... Oooooo ... ahhh ... yuck. It would have been much better if Bay had gone down the tasteful, respectful path rather than the shock, showman route.  My favourite cringe-worthy lines -  Alec Baldwin as the General (or whatever he was) - The heart of a volunteer is the noblest of all.  Josh Hartnett, while looking at himself in the mirror wearing his uniform - (Crying) You know, whenever I see mahself in this here uniform .... I just don't feel like a hero. (Cries some more).  Also cringe-worthy is the way the Japanese are portrayed in the movie. Whenever we see Americans, there is beautiful music playing behind images of pretty scenery and lovely, bright colours. Whenever the Japanese are shown, we see dark, grey tones and booming, dark, evil music thumping away. Cut back to Americans ... cue pretty music and bright colours. Talk about manipulate the audience's emotions, rather than Bay making his point in some subtle way ... like a good script.  How can anyone think this piece of garbage is worth 4 stars?  The soundtrack is incredible though. Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderous. Its a pity his talent and genius was wasted on such trash 
 i thought that the overall message of the book was fantastic, however the writing and story left a lot to be desired, there were even several gramatical errors, and spelling mistakes. When asked about this book i simply respond "a very inspiring message, but i wouldn't reccomend it as a book. 
 This movie was really a waste of money. the writing the directin are all very bad. it is also very low budget which i thought would increase the realness but i was wrong safe your money and keep searchin 
 JoJo has some talent,but whoever is handling her career isn't going about things in the right way. these songs sound like a dime a dozen. a bit Christina here a bit Beyonce there, basically lets play name that tune&Vocal run. JoJo wants to be mentioned as a Artist with R&B roots,but thus far her music comes across like generic attempts at trying to hybrid R&B. if JoJo ever aspires to be the Teena Marie of her Generation than she will need the right Producer&also get some real songwriting as to the fast food vibe that is felt on alot of these tracks 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem 
 The translation of the book is done very poorly.  There are sentences that don't make sense in the English language that may in French. Or, I'm guessing, they are errors in the translation.  There are the use of French terms with slips into American colloquialisms.  E.g., calling a psychiatrist an "analyst" in one sentence, then a "shrink" in another.    I think the basic idea of the book came across, but the translation was terrible. It was awkward and jumpy, which really detracted from the storyline. I'm going to buy the French version of the book and put it through the babelfish translator and I'm sure I'll understand this story more than the current translation 
 I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I'm sorry to say that this product failed to meet my expectations.   Pros Tight connection to laptop  Cons -Too easy to accidentally change the combination which makes it difficult to set the combo and remove the lock. -This product is built to fit on the right side of a laptop.  If you're laptop is like mine where the plug is on the left side, you have to turn the laptop around in order to unlock it (unless you don't mind doing it backwards) 
 Having enjoyed much of Tosca's earlier works, I picked this up on faith. After listening to it, however, it's clear I made a big mistake. This is one of the worst albums I've heard in a long time. Tosca should be ashamed of themselves for attaching their name to a collection of dated, uncreative remixes by a bunch of hack DJs. As if to add insult to injury, their one "new" track on here is 9 seconds of silence. Unfortunately, I'm quite serious. It will hard for me to overlook this travesty of an album the next time a Tosca CD comes out 
 This book reads too much like a college textbook.  If you are doing a research paper for a psychology class, then this book is for you.  I found this book's approach oftentimes so overly analytical that it felt impersonal.  Also, many of the case studies were difficult to relate to.  As a woman, I believe I need to find a book that is written by a FEMALE who knows full well the complexities of a woman's mind and can understand on a certain level. I'm looking for a book that offers me encouragement in a compassionate and meaningful way.  This book just didn't do it for me, so I sent it back 
 Many of us have the sinking feeling that the Internet is starting to resemble television. As the saying goes, "There are 500 television stations, but nothing's on." Estimates vary about the number of Web sites on the Internet. By some estimates, there are 300 million. Which means there are 300 million Web sites and nothing's on. Most of the Web sites aren't worth visiting.  The author of "Best of the Internet" wants to direct you to the Web sites that are worth going to. To that end, he has assembled some 1,000 Web site names and descriptions into 19 categories -- reference, communicating, computing, entertainment, news, sports, hobbies, family, education, health, lifestyles, religion, finance, careers, shopping, travel, government, and the weird.  If you are willing to trudge through this book's 420 pages, you will find more than a few good Web sites. I found a number of good online stores, for example. But the problem with this book is that the author mostly presents the tried and true. He doesn't stray from the beaten track. You discover Web sites that you could probably find on your own or already know about.  I thought the book book presented far too many corporate Web sites. Do I need to know that Disney.com is a good family-oriented Web site? The author could have searched a little farther for eccentric Web sites that are of interest to families. I find corporate Web sites dull and uninspiring, but many are listed in this book.  Another thing: The Web site descriptions are long-winded. By the time you read some of these descriptions, you could have visited the Web site on your own and decided for yourself whether it is worth visiting.  I hope if the author revises this book that he cuts back on the Web site descriptions and gives us more Web sites instead. How about 2,000 Web sites next time instead of 1,000, with fewer words to describe each Web site? 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 I ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button, snap, zipper, catch, or anything else that could possibly have snagged it.  It was not nearly as soft as I expected for the price either. It was better than what you'd expect from your standard hotel towel, but it wasn't any softer than my towels from the JC Penny Collection.  The redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 This DVD 3-D Box set, is great to add to any collection. It is more focused on bring computer effects to life. I have been to Imax and can advise that the effects are just as good.  Only 1 BIG problem:   If you are luckly enough to own a projector or Old TV set around 5 years or older. You should be able to set back and enjoy.  For some unknown reason the 3-D Box set WILL not work with HI-END TV's or most Plasma screens out today.  If you buy the Box set, be carefull, as the set is VERY unlikely to work with your screen.  I bought 2 sets: Both sets did not work on my Plasma screen.                  Both worked well on the projector 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 New Rule:  Stop confusing cruelty with honesty.  -Bill Maher thinks it's his job to tell people the "ugly" truth. But truth that doesn't help make things better is really cruelty gift-wrapped.  Telling people their religions are bogus is not helpful. He says we don't need a savior or a religion or a God, but everyday people are on their hands and knees begging for one. I guess if I had been born a white man in America and never faced any hardships or heartaches, I wouldn't need God either. Furthermore, everybody has religion. It's just that all of our religions aren't in churches. Some people's religions are drugs or sex or pain or alcohol or anything else that we use to help fill that void in our hearts. What's YOUR religion?  It's also funny how Bill Maher ISN'T a Democrat, yet most of his fans are. Hmmm, ever heard the saying, you are what you attract? Libertarianism is only liberalism by a different name. Compare the two and find they agree 95% of the time.  The bottom line is Bill Maher is an arrogant man who thinks he's right about everything and that the majority of America is stupid. Well if America is so stupid, why should we have a democratic system where the stupid have influence? Why not have an oligarchy where only Cornell graduates make the decisions? Better yet, why don't we have a dictatorship with Maher as our leader considering he's the only one with any real intelligence.  He's an immoral man who thinks he's moral because he confuses it with ethics. Ethics is how fairly you treat people. Morality is Godly obedience. Morality says it's wrong to be a pros-ti-tute because our bodies are sacred. Ethics says it's wrong for a pros-ti-tute to t-i-e her John to the b-e-d then steal his wallet. 
 This book is stuck in an archaic age.  Get something more relevan 
 I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.    The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized?   I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.    The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.    Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.  I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.  I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.  
 It is extemely difficult to select stories from five of the greatest SF writers (add Clarke and Asimov and you have the top seven) of the 20th century to give the whole volume a negative, downbeat tone, but Fred Pohl has managed it.  If you like your stories upbeat and hopeful for the human race (in the editorial fashion of John Campbell) this book is a definite "save your money."  I have been reading these authors since the 1950s, and I can't imagine a worse set of choices 
 After reading the glorious reviews by other customers, I was very excited to receive this book. I was so disappointed by the dull colors and simplicity of the cutouts. I was expecting some text with the pop-outs not just one word descriptions. I returned this book the same day I got it 
 I found "Barrio Boy" to be very boring, as a matter of fact I didn't even try to finish the book.  So save your money and buy something better 
 I hate this book.  The author coins a catch phrase "ambitchious" and uses it CONSTANTLY throughout the book.  It sounds like a "call to battle" for all women.  I loathe the attitude that this book takes that it's us against them.  Why can't we realize that we all need each other in the business world.  I believe that many women need empowerment (I am one of them) but I think this book sets the wrong tone.  I am re-selling my book ASAP.  
 I bought this cd without listening to it because I love Nickel Creek so much. What a big mistake. MAS is just dull. In a world of exciting and glorious music, what a disappointment it was to buy this cd 
 Don't pay money to see this. Wood Harris is not a bad actor; quite the antithesis. He made a heroic effort to portray a man whose persona, mannerisms, and "vibe" simply cannot be immitated. Kudos to Mr. Harris for his bravery. The director did a mediocre job bringing life to a badly written script. Granted, Hendrix' story had a great deal of tragedy; but I have it on good authority that Hendrix was also a lot of fun to be around.  The scene that described his death was not historicaly accurate: and I know people who were personally aquainted with Hendrix and were around when he died: and they told me what REALLY happened that day. The music was marred by the fact that nobody can play the guitar like Hendrix without sounding like someone trying to immitate him, and Hendrix' estate refused to allow them to use any of his original compositions. The glossing over of the music; which was Hendrix' greatest accomplishment, was truly irritating. All it was was sensationalism and Hollywood glamor: all flash and no substance - which does a great disservice to Hendrix' legacy, musical genius, and life. The whole thing made me sick. 
 Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last. 
 I was an art history student when I took a class in 18th century art. This text is unfortunately the only survey of Rococo and French academy art from the era, so there are very few alternatives than just the Rococo chapter in a general survey book like Janson's History of Art. The material is organized thematically, not chronologically, which could be engaging if the text was not so confusing or superficial. Most of the book focuses on the art of the 17th century, and absolutely nothing after 1760. The section on Rococo interiors is fairly comprehensive, however, and to his credit, Minor does include writings from Winkelmann and Diderot, grave omissions from previous survey texts 
 Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.  No "swiss army stuff". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife?   That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a "home" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing 
 This is the second book in this series that I have read. I would consider these a type of culinary cosy type mystery with a few elements of quaint hard boiled detective, which normally I would love......... BUT I found the main character incredibly offensive. I think Fairbanks was trying to create a prim and proper heroine, but someone who stuck to her guns as well, a kind of steel magnolia. It sounds like it would be a cute combination, but consistently thrown in are degrading remarks about feminists and/or women with jobs, etc. In the first book in the series she mentioned with pride that she was not part of the counter culture revolution in the 60s. Gah!! Does Carolyn Blue (the main character) wish that the path towards racial and sexual equality didn't happen? She seems so out of touch with everything, as though something went wrong in the way how Fairbanks characterized/wrote Blue.   In the first book, there were strange racial comments about a French chef and a New Orleans maid. In this book, the Indian cab driver and the Japanese, well, stereotypes abound. There is some Muslim bashing too- although the main character did not utter them, still, ick.  I think Fairbanks was using ethnic and racial stereotypes to add more of a locational flavor to the books, but well, for me it backfired. I don't think she was trying to be racist or sexist, but eventually all of the little "oddities" combined together into something where I was so uncomfortable I couldn't enjoy the book, which is really annoying since normally I love the type of mystery book it appeared to be. The anti-feminist comments that Carolyn makes are in some ways even ickier than the racist ones because they aren't only stereotypes, but a type of judgment. Yes, Fairbanks tries to counter Carolyn's attitude by mentioning every now and then her strong, intelligent daughter, but it can't erase what has already been written.  Also, I felt that the book had a hard time coming together at the end, but I can't bring myself to go back and re-read to see if I missed some trivial line that would help it make more sense.  In essence, Truffled Feathers kind of ruffled my feathers. Sorry! Couldn't help myself.   The worst of the comments are really in the first few chapters of the book, which maybe that Fairbanks was only trying to set stages and solidify characters instead of being... not nice. So maybe if a reader would just skim over the first part they would have a better reading experience than me. The one star I gave this book feels too high 
 I felt sad that this information Was actually  in hands of over million people,yet I know that Creator of Nature and it's powers in herbs will prove to be otherwise than described in this "book". There's some good info in it,almost as if you give enough good to trick the public in beliving the bad.  It is as if it was written by the FDA agents themself or Allopathic Medicine so called "Modern medicine".As if it was written to "label" herbs for not more than decorative. Almost Every herb that is truly amazing is somehow at the end of these authors "descriptions" darkened,and when you KNOW and PRACTICE herbalisam you know that iS not truth,and also I find it little "sticky" that there's a so called "miracle" drug out there that is a better choice? Man will never conquer the VERY CREATOR OF NATURE AND IT'S POWER,and no greed will ever rule over it! So KNOW that there's NO miracle drug out there,Nature with it's powers teaches us PATIENCE and that everything needs IT'S Time to Heal. Decide for yourself,please on this book. I pray that you enrich yourself with many books out there that HONOR MOTHER NATURE FOR ALL IT'S WORTH!PEACE BE WITH YOU! 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 I am extremely disapointed that the recipes in this book are not vegetarian.I recommend this book to no one.   Buy Mollie Katzen's excellent cookbooks The Moosewood Cookbook, Still Life With Menu, and Vegetable Heaven instead

 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 Somewhat better organized than the other Roseville books, however, the quality of the photos are horrible.  Looks like they scanned low resolution images from a catalogs.  A lot of incomplete model numbers in the pictures.  If you buy this book you need to buy another Roseville book as a companion so that you can validate the information.  I doubt the author is actually a collector 
 In Stephen  Silbiger's words, "I realised that the basics of an MBA education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience." What the author is trying to do with his book is to cram in two years of an MBA education into 350 pages. Naturally, the book misses the whole point of the exercise of a University education: it takes time to grasp the often complex models that students will have to master in order to be eligible for a diploma with their name on it. It may be true that a lot of MBA programmes are very repetitive and that the basic information can indeed be summarised into a few pages only, however this means that all the details is missing.  As we all know, MBA programmes are very heterogeneous and will all differentiate at teaching something slightly different, in as far as the subjects are concerned (obviously the contents remains the same for the same subjects). Silbiger's MBA is based upon 9 subjects, where others like negotiation, international business, entrepreneurship, or project management are all summarised into one chapter.   What this book does well, is to emphasise that the main objective of an MBA is to be able to take a global decision within an organisation, that is decide in such a way that no aspect of your entrerprise will be defavoured in any way. However, not only does the book lack in perspective (the author literally bases his this book on his personal educational experience and does not focus at all beyond the US border), but at the same time the contents of this book is very shallow. The great theories are only outlined in very general terms and a lot of detail and further theories that you should expect from a sound MBA, are missing totally. The book is an insult for all those who have actually completed an MBA, by spending one or two years at a constitutional MBA, and puts the non-MBA reader at a very low level.  Thus only the lowest rating can be awarded for this book, as it fails to deliver what it promises 
 At least the one I recieved for Christmas just simply does not work!  OK so now I have to figure out how to return it...  this was a gift that came from out of my household, but none the less I was given the receipt.  However if you call the 1-800 number all you get is a recording that says if you leave a name and number they will get back to you by tomorrow or... go to their website and see instructions for return.  This was ordered from Amazon so I don't have "Their" web address!!!! Hmmm  FYI 
 I found myself continually frustrated with the stupid actions of Miss Zukas, constantly putting herself in harm's way 
 I purchased this based on the reviews here at Amazon. I am an architect and I thought it would contain traditional details and construction methods....it does not. What it does have is small black and white pictures of "do's" and "don'ts" for such building components as arches, dormers, water tables, etc. Very much a primer for those who do not have a working knowledge or understanding of good construction practices or techniques. Great, but needlessly expensive, book for the freshman student of architecture, or layman who scratches their head when looking at a McMansion while trying to figure out just what makes it so darned ugly (proportion, scale, details). There are better choices out there for half the money 
 The WORST movie ever made. Thank God I just rented and did not buy it. It Doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 Bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra  parts.  But the surprise here is the complicity of Amazon in this misleading packaging.  This is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found.  They know they made a mistake. If only they  would contact us each now for a full refund.     I wish a rep from Amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger.  I wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for. ..his "big" gift 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 are the words that describe this book.  I am studying for a test right now and I can't bear to read even one more page.  I'm not just saying this because its a school book and school is boring...this book is really excruciatingly repetitive and horribly worded.  I gotta read alot of the stuff multiple times just to understand what this [guy] is trying to say.  He could have simplified the book so it's half the length that it is.  Ravi Sethi, the author, sounds like a [conceited person] who thinks he's so smart...He should be fined for writing this book and making poor college students like me read it.  This book is causing me much mental anguish 
 I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN "NIKON EAGLE VIEW" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!! 
 Hi I'm Steven, I disliked this book for a number of reasons. It changed chapters to quickly, so it is hard to understand the life of Vinny and Li as a child growing up.  Once you start to uderstand what Peter Dickenson is talking about, he changes the chapters, so it makes it very very coppy, and  then you get annoyed becuase it keeps changing chapters, from Vinny's life  to Li's life, then back to Vinny's and then Li's you get the picture. And  Li changing evolution in about two years.(what I call the quicky  evolution)Li shouldn't think she is so different, all that happened was the  shark thing in the biginning of the book, and then the thing with the shell  at the end.  The Then story of the book ended really poorly, with she  turned the rock with the shell.  And the Now chapter cocentrated mostly on  her relationship with her dad, and not digging for bones and more important  stuff like that.  Actually I thought the Now chapter ended much better than  the Then chapter with Vinny finding the bone that Li had squished into the  end of the book, to end the Now chapter.  And that is my review of Bone  from a Dry Sea By Steven H 
 Patrick Collison's Reformation: A History, is off the mark, for it fails to produce the overall effect that the title suggests.  It is not a history, in the true sense, for his subject matter is buried too far in obscure theory and it lacks precise modes of chronological sequencing (time-ordering of people, places, things, causes and effects) .  This work is more like a mixed bag of essays, which insufficiently treats subjects tied to the Reformation.  Also, Collison writes in distasteful, unbalanced, and unpolished prose, and so does not even add a rhetorical coloring to his already stale and humdrum work on the Reformation.  Of the hundreds of works to turn to for guidance to knowledge of the Reformation, Collison's is not even suggested among those.  Instead, consult Diarmaid MacCulloch, Will Durant, or Phillip Schaff, for authoritative works on the Reformation.    
 This book is as jaded and contrived as Dr Peirce's class.  There is only one chapter worth reading #7, the rest of the book serves absolutely no value.  Furthermore, I agree with the previous reviewer that Dr. Peirce  makes some very strong statements in his class.  However, why didn't the  put them in his book?   I guess other professors in the field would have  laughed at him.  Do not buy this book..........and save yourself 15 weeks of  torture by not taking his class at Nova............MBA9 
 We've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it's OK but nothing special. It does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed, nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality 
 Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he  realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket statements he makes,it's irresponsible. Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these  myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!

 Unlike God who no one has seen (at least in 2,000 plus years or so and then only in the collection of stories called the Bible), you can at least see, talk to, and hopefully touch an atheist. This book reminds me of the pitiful attempts by fundies that I grew up with to look intellectual. They set up a straw man (by dumbing down, incorrectly stating and generally taking out of context the philosophical positions of any one who is not born-again) and then proceed to knock it down. An atheist just believes in one less god than the fundies, after all they also don't believe in Zeus, Odin or any one of the 2,000 plus gods mankind has invented in it's history either. 
 Nothing worse than taking a traditional Christmas song and messing it up by any genre.  I just heard Merry Texas Christmas, Y'all on the radio and I am about sick to my stomach.  Next thing we know someone will come out with a rap album called "Deck the Ho's" -- no difference than this 
 i read this more as an essay and commentary regarding prewar england.  themes of church intollerance, school rigidity, classism, bigotry, etc. abound.  one can read this literally, leaving the task confused and befuddled.  one should read this metaphorically, perhaps as a dream sequence, to fairly appreciate what orwell sought to accomplish.  i enjoyed elements of this for the sheer brilliance of observation.  life at the hops camp was particularlly sharp.  if one appreciates gritty labor struggles and observations of the religiously constrained, this will be a pile of words worth reading 
 There is no way this man can be serious.  This book is a joke, it has to be.  It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane.  I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.  The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.    Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic.  If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within 
 I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them:  The Book of Ruth, A Map of the World, Short History of a Prince and Disobedience.  This book, sadly, does not rank among them.  It feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios.  I've already paid for it, so I'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money.  Read another Hamilton instead 
 This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 I run hot and cold with Clint Eastwood. Hot with movies like "Outlaw Josey Wales", and "Dirty Harry". "Unforgiven" ranks right up there with  "Bridges of Madison County" as two of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Sorry fans 
 As a Russian Student at Moscow Lomonsov State University, my whole education is surrounded by Russia, Russians, and most of all history. I love it. But I don't love this book. I've had it for almost three years and still can't get around to finishing it all. It's a big, big book. One of the reason why I love history books so much is because they are a bargain! However that didn't turn me off, I actually was quite happy with the amount of information and the color excepts were fantastic. I can tell the author is enthusiasm for the cultural history because it goes from speaking about traveling musicians to how Peter the Great abhorred the unwesternized ways of Moscow. I mean, it goes from one thing to an completely different topic in only a paragraph on one page, and then picks up back with describing the local music of the small villages. The information is so rich and he wants to describe everything to us at once that the reader can get so overwhelmed and lost that it becomes boring to read. It isn't my first history book and I have so many unexciting textbooks I have to read, but I rather read my law book -- in Cyrillic -- then attempt to actually finish this book. You would think with around 700 pages he would be able to take his time. No doubt, this is for the serious reader and someone who is in need to cite something for their term paper (the index works very well indeed, that's one star) and the major information it gives you that you could hardly find in a text book (that's another star) but as reading you  
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 Domestic Disturbance is a typical Hollywood film.  The story, characters, and even the camerawork all seem prefabricated and recycled.  The language that Travolta and Vaughn spurt from their mouths even feels repetitive.  Do you know why?  Because we have seen it all before.  This film did not scare me, did not entice me, or even excite me in anyway because of the resemblance this had to every other film of this genre.  It is the classic story of the boy that cried wolf too many times and eventually everyone never believed him.  It is the classic story of the strength of a father that believes that when life throws lemons, that he must make lemonade.  It is the classic story of the family struggle to survive against all odds.  It is nothing fresh, it is nothing new, it is nothing remarkable.  It is Hollywood, in its purest form.  Audiences paid money to see this recycled film and for that I think we should all be issued an apology from the Hollywood community.    I even have the subtle feeling that everyone involved in this project felt the same way.  Travolta and Vaughn are laughable in their roles.  The child actor was acting, and you could tell every time he was on screen.  The only "fun" character in this entire production was Steve Buscemi, who continually plays this slippery sneaky fishy looking character that just gets under your skin the wrong way.  He was perfect, I only wish I could say the same for everyone else.  Perhaps it is my newer images of Vaughn that hurt him in this role.  After seeing the comedy duds like Dodgeball and Starsky & Hutch, I couldn't help but think that Vaughn was trying to play a bit of comedy into this role as well.  He just didn't seem to fit.  His eyes needed to see evil, when in fact they saw nothing more than the cue cards reminding him of his lines.  I kept waiting to hear him say something to Travolta about "Vegas Baby, Vegas", but alas, it never occurred.  I felt similar about Travolta's role in this film.  His character suffered from lack of solidity.  I never felt that he was a strong father.  I knew he could build boats, but fight evil I just couldn't see it.  I also had trouble seeing the father/son dynamic.  During the scenes that him and O'Leary share, I continually felt that they were acting their parts, not building the characters.  It was sad, and only left me with a weak impression of them when the climax occurred.  Teri Polo was shallow, really contributing nothing to the story other than the classic role of mother who will not believe, while child actor Matt O'Leary definatly needed more time with an acting coach before landing this role.  All of these paid actors were going through their parts, but not into their characters, which ultimately flawed the film.  What happens when you have actors not reaching their potential and a story that seems like it could be a "Made-for-TV-Movie"?  You get the film Domestic Disturbance.  The story was horrible.  Father who loves his son, who cannot let go of a previous life (although it seemed that in the film Travolta and Polo were ok with there divorce), who doesn't trust his ex-wife's new beau.  This seemed like a very troubled man instead of the hero that he portrayed.  I also felt that this story really didn't give any credit to the local police.  Instead of investigating, it seemed like they were just sitting around.  That was Travolta's tax dollars at work, but instead he ended up doing all the work.  It reminded me of the times that I have to bag my own groceries at the story.  Am I not paying for the goods so that they can provide baggers?  Ah well.  From the opening scene of this film until the unclimactic ending (which made me chuckle due to the lack of sympathy), it was nothing more than Hollywood fluff.  Travolta had been making a strong return to the film industry prior to this project, and I wish that somebody had talked him out of it.  This film was filler, and plenty of people got paid for some shoddy workmanship.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this film.  In fact, I was more than disappointed, I was appalled.  This had no redeeming value to it (outside of Buscemi) and it continually perplexed me as to why it was made.  There was no stretching of anyone's acting ability, nor did I ever really see the power family structure that was so important to the characters.  What I saw was an angry father upset about the path his life has taken, and decides to do something about it using his son's lies as a crutch.  Perhaps I needed Vaughn's character to be darker, or maybe more boats built to help me understand Travolta's role, but something needed to happen and it didn't.  This was a sad excuse of a film, and I do not recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the cinema.  Grade: ** out of **** 
 As an American with shoddy French skills who has been living in the Il de France for the past six months, I found this book incredibly superficial at best and whiny and self-indulgent at worst.  First of all, to call this book a love story is ridiculous.  Frederic has less presence in the book than her pedigreed dog (or was THAT the "love story"?). From what I read, poor old Frederic seemed no more than a ticket to stay in France, rent free, because she had nothing better to do. And let me see, what were her insights?  That French is difficult?  That French people like meat?  Wow, great journalism, there.  One day in France is all you need to figure that out.  As far as her assessments on the psychology of French women (they're threatened, which explains their lack of friendliness towards her), what self-serving balderdash is that?  Let me propose a few alternate theories:  A) threatened and rude women come in every nationality; B) maybe they weren't talking to her because it's difficult to communicate with someone with lousy French skills; C) Maybe they just didn't like HER. For the life of me, I don't understand the positive reviews of this book.  But maybe in an age of CNN, MTV and people who travel no further than to the other side of their living room to search for their lost remote control, this is what qualifies for insightful journalism/entertainment. Now, Ms. Turnbull might attribute my negativity towards her book to some sort of jealousy since I have had none of the advantages she had while living here.  I pay rent.  I knew no-one when I got here.  I was forced to communicate without the convenience of a fluent boyfriend to translate for me.  I had to make friends based on personality, wit and mime skills.  But I'd like to suggest that if she'd had some of those "disadvantages" (and a little depth) her book might have been less annoying, more interesting and worth the short time spent reading it 
 The author definitely has some issues with his father. It's always easiest to blame the parents. Although well organized, it's still a pretty cheap piece of whining. 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 This book attempts to take a middle-of-the-road point of view, so that the reader can see both sides.  But which road is it in the middle of?  War on one side, with peace on the other?  Western nations on one side and Arab nations on the other?    Maybe the author ought to have read Dante, who said that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in times of great moral crises, maintain their neutrality!  One example I am familiar with is the Arab war against Israel.  In this case, the Arab side feels that it has a right to get rid of Israel.  That is why the Arabs became the aggressors in the first place.  But the author doesn't seem to agree.  Maybe such a statement would seem politically incorrect.  So instead, we get the explanation that some people think the Arabs are the aggressors, some think the Israelis are the aggressors, and some simply see it as a cycle of violence.  And this latter explanation is allowed to look plausible.    In fact, if Arab aggression were to stop, that would produce peace.  No matter who is right and who is wrong, Israel would have to be suicidal to fight against neighbors that were willing to live with it in peace.  And Israel is not suicidal.    To back up this midde-of-the-road attitude, Davis says that in Jenin in 2002, both sides behaved badly.  Unfortunately, Jenin is one case where Israeli forces were at their best and at their most justified.  Saying otherwise is simply misleading the reader.    Davis also indicates that a fundamental solution of the conflict is for Israel to give away its claims on the West Bank to the Arabs, and to render that region Judenrein.  He fails to tell us that the West Bank is in fact disputed territory, and that for Israel to do this would be equivalent to having France donate Alsace and Lorraine to Germany and ethnically cleansing the region of all Francophones.  I'd rather see some accuracy and honesty than this ill-advised attempt at political correctness. 
 After the Ice is well written and contains lots of information; however, my enjoyment of the book was significantly reduced by the author's obvious Socialist leanings and hatred of America.  Further, his unquestioning worship of the THEORY of global warming got old real fast.  There is as much or more data supporting the THEORY of an upcoming ice age.  In any  event we can not influence the matter in any significant way - when Mother Nature speaks, we listen; not the other way 'round.  Sarge Reynolds, Geologist 
 I doubt many who have written reviews here are actual college students.  Physics is probably one of the most challenging courses one can take.  Nevertheless, it can also be an exciting field of study - this book doesn't do it justice though.  It has the potential of scaring off newcomers.      While the book's overall visual presentation is nicely done, the theory behind various mathematical laws is poor.  Often, it takes two or three paragraphs of rambling before getting to the point on a topic.    Each chapter has its own set of word problems to solve.  While some of the problems are generally a piece of cake, most contain subtleties and assume you know far too much prior knowledge outside the book.  It would be a nightmare solving these problems without the answer/studyguide book handy.  That guide is almost as large as the textbook and sells for almost $70 alone.  Even with the studyguide, some of the demonstrations are illogical and don't necessarily reflect the material you learnt in the current or previous chapters.  I've even seen plenty of cases where the math contradicts what the material in the chapter stated!    Although the book says it is a calculus-based text, there really isn't a whole lot of it in there.  This might be a blessing to some but isn't always practical in the real world.  My Calculus textbook covered physics problems better than this textbook!  The authors tend to brush basic differentiation/integration in the theory portions but they're never really used in actual problems.    The PhysicsNow online study tool has some neat diagrams and interactive problems but is still generally useless.  Good luck getting your account activated when registering online!  I had to call customer service several times before I could actually login to the site.    I could conclude in saying that this book does make a great reference book to people who already have knowledge in physics.  However, I'm sure there are better textbooks out there that can teach you the basics if you're new to the field.  Many fellow students in my physics classes have shared the same grunts about the book as much as I have and agree that this book can make physics frustrating to the newbie.  
 Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world.  His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.  Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world  at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons.  By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings 
 Worked great for about a year of very limited use.  Visit the manufacturer's website forum for issues with this product.  Previously purchased models failed on or about the same date.  Something about the 2.4Ghz transceivers messing up.  I cannot confirm the date because I was inbetween gamming rigs at the time, but I tried to use this joystick after getting my new rig fired up and was set back when I encountered the calibration issues.  There is no fix for this and if you hadn't put in the warranty card, then your out your investment.  Go with wired untill the manufacturer takes some responsibility 
 Geoffrey Guilliano.A man who seems to write a Beatles book every month. This one saw Harrison threatening to SUE. Save your money and buy instead the GEORGE HARRISON ENCYCLOPEDIA by Bill Harry. And check out what they REALLY say about this Beatles author on many sites. Guilliano once wrote a book about Pete Townshend and admitted stealing tapes from him until the Who guitarist caught him and threw him out of his house.Yet why tell the World? He fled the States because of the amount of bad cheques he wrote!  The man who once wrote "I can't wait till the rest of them die then I can write more books without the risk of being sued" has this on his website and its a terrible thing to say. I first picked up one of his books in a charity shop and was impressed by the amount of pictures and memorabilia.After that I got a DVD called CELEBRATION,same as the book and for a fiver I got the 4 Talking Books. These sound to be the products of somebody else and not a man named as "most despised Beatles author".I would have to admit the book was excellent and hardly any errors Yet errors is something which occurs frequently according to other reviews I read. Modest enough to stick his own picture on everything at least 4 times I thought he had a rather boring contemptuous voice.Apparantly the author buys a lot of stuff off EBay rather than pay some of the money he owes:this is what's shown in CELEBRATION. I star is because I couldn't give the book a lower on 
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 This was a very ordinary spy novel. Nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful. Way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a LeCarre or Deigton would have.. If this book were a movie it would be classified as "B".....  This is the first Littel book that I've read. Some reviews stated that Littel was in the genre of the great spy masters. Based on that info I purchased this one and one called The Company... Well, in the lexicon of Howard Cossell; " Fugetaboutit"!! He is a long, long way from the Masters .. 
 If you are a closed-minded member of Christendom's juggernaut, this book is for you! If you want unbiased truth about smaller groups, you'll have better results from other publications 
 In all honesty, I'd rate the fragrance itself as "5 stars," however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why I give it a mere "1 star."  You'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  Talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what I've written here.  Because I adore the scent, I'm going to try the Baby Phat Goddess Body Lotion and see if that has a lingering effect 
 I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!  Spoilers ahead - please don't read on if you haven't read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, 'Wideacre', which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory's novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I'd bought it and it looked more promising.  It was 'marginally better' as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.  I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn't marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.  The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.  I don't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.  This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.  Clean slate, so to speak.  Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!  What?!  And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!) but she was perfect and beautiful.  I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she'd never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...  The perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.  Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn't you?  he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen's books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia's was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn't her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it's too late!) and they marry and have 'normal' children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.  There were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.  So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh... SO frustrating.  I will not be reading the third book in the series.  I shall go back to reading Gregory's more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven't read yet and it sounds excellent).  I wouldn't recommend this one 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 As someone who was certainly an undergraduate when Sacks was teaching and who has taught both high school and college, I have to say that I found the book to be quite laughable.  The entire book seems to come down to, "These damn kids today!  Boy, when I was a kid..." and resembles little more than one of Grandpa Simpson's long meandering stories.  (*Gasp!* a reference to popular culture, oh no!) Sacks never had any teaching experience nor training and was somehow suprized to learn that he was horrible at teaching.  What?   You mean to do something well you might need to learn about it and have some experience doing it???  This is, of course, ironic because Sacks was teaching classes on journalism and constantly critiques his students who ignore his journalistic experience and yet throughout the book he ignores and mocks the advice of teachers who have teaching experience.   Dear Kettle,  You are black.   Sincerely, The Pot. Throughout the book he makes constant references to kids who wear baseball hats in class, sloutch, and have piercings as if someone's appearance is indicative of their worth or ability.  I'm sure he would have a heart attack if he walked into my classroom and saw me teaching with a baseball hat on. All of his critiques would be fine if only he had done one thing: research.  He constantly compares his experiences as a teacher in the 90s with his own experiences as a student decades before.  However, all he offers is anecdotal evidence based on his own memories when comparing students then and in the 90s.  If he had taken a minute to get down off of his high horse he might have went and talked to some teachers who had been around for decades and asked them their thoughts on students, or even better, go hunt down his college professors and ask them about classes in which he was a student.  However, rather than go out and do some good investigative reporting and gather all the facts, he chose to write a poorly informed book-length letter to the editor about those damn kids who keep walking on his lawn.   This book is a missed opportunity to have a real look at students in colleges.  It is a shame that someone with no teaching experience and such an inflated self of self-importance (the very things he chastises his students for) chose to think that he was qualified to write it. 
 the contents of the tapes as usual is invaluable.  some of the tapes skip and do not play efficientl 
 I once again gave wayne dyer a chance and again I try not to sleep as he drones on about magical formulas....and WAYNE WAYNE WAYNE WAYNE.......Wayne did this Wayne did that...sorry wayne no more Dollars from me......... 
 Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves.   To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the "cheesiness" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.   I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 This book tries to cover a lot of ground, but in the end you get a sense that it has gotten you anywhere.  The first impression I got was that this book was actually a bunch of journal articles thrown together because there isn't much sense of continuity to this book.  It doesn't have an overall theme and the topics covered don't seem to connect well.  It starts off with a short biography of the Grimms, so far so good.  After that, it covers the orgins of the tales, a little dry, but not bad.  After that, there's a chapter about how the Grimm tales indoctrinate children into the bourgeoisie.  The Marxism seems a little dated.  After that, out of the blue, you get a chapter on Henri Pourrault, an obscure writer of fairy tales.  It's never explained why this writer is in this book, but I guess the author really liked this journal article and couldn't resist throwing it in.  After this, it gets really weird.  You get a chapter about how fairy tales are all about childhood sexual abuse.  If that doesn't kill your mood to read fairy tales, then the following chapter in which the author attacks the Grimm tales as outdated and obsolete and advocates the rewriting of the tales for more modern perspectives will.  One gem that the author singles out for praise is a rewriting of Cinderella.  In this version, Cinderella is a labor organizer who organizes all the workers in her kingdom.  The prince, impressed by her accomplishments, falls in lover with her and proposes.  However, Cinderella refuses to betray the worker and rejects the prince.  In the end, Cinderella moves to America and the prince commits suicide over the heartbreak.  Wow, the kids will love that one.  It's not even entertaining or enlightening for adults and borders on masochistic.  That's some of the nonsense that you'll run into in this book.  I really recommend that you pass on this 
 I ordered this Mei Ah edition and regretted it after the first five minutes of watching. The visual quality is average, but, as Anaguma reports below, the English subtitles are execrable, which is a grating distraction. The good news is that Criterion will be issuing a new edition in January 2006; if past performance is any indication, it should be excellent 
 When I first heard there was an American version of L'Uomo Vouge I was really excited.  I thought "finally an American men's fashion magazine that'll be edgy, risky, creative & original!"  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster Men's magazines GQ, Esquire & Details.  European men's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography, bold reporting & beautiful advertising.  You won't find any of this in Men's Vouge.  The editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of American readers.  If I could I'd give this magazine a negative 5 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.  Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.  Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).  All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)  Cheers. 
 This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.  Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.  That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.    This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.    
 I have an only child and am always interested in learning more, the categories seem to be the same as what I have already read on.   I would not by this book, simply because of the title.  I do not think "sins" is appropriate and it is a big turn away to me.  Many parents of only children feel inadequate having only one child and to use this in the title just doesn't help much. 
 ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics 
 I was so anxious to read this after waiting so long for the 2nd book.  I loved White Oleander.  This book is psychotic and not much of a story.  Very disappointing from a talented author 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 Ruby Payne's A Framework for Understanding Poverty describes a personal journey, but falls short of creating an entire framework of poverty applicable to all situations. Since her evidence is based solely on her personal experience, if readers apply her theories, it will only exacerbate existing stereotypes.    Payne's book is riddled with over generalizations. It has been our experience that people in poverty do not feel a "need to beat around the bush" (30).  And by stating this, is she implying that all middle and upper class people always speak directly to the point?  The fact remains that patterns of discourse (and poverty), rely more on regional, cultural, and societal factors, which Payne simply does not address.  Furthermore, her assertion that "fighting and physical violence are a part of poverty" (37) confirms the bias of her own personal experience imbedded in her publication, and about people in poverty around the world.  The result is a deficit theory perspective that  adversely affects her approach in dealing with an impoverished population.  Even more frightening is the fact that she influences the approach of many others who read her book without a critical mindset, and assume the same biases and stereotypes which may hinder rather than help those trying to escape poverty.  We recommend future readers of this book to  read with caution, and resist her attempts to facilitate assimilation into a classist society 
 Albert Einstein is the greatest and most original thinker in the history of mankind.  He was a Jew.  He was a Zionist.  Some people cannot swallow that.  If you feel like you choke and you cannot breathe when you read this, then this book is for you.  Enjoy it 
 I liked the iAUdio but 8 months after buying it, it no longer plays in stereo and the voice record d/n work.  COWON'S WEBSITE IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE! You can't submit a question unless you log in but they won't let you log in because every e-mail address you type in they say "already used" which is an error because I used addresses that were brand new. Cowon is too cheap to provide the support needed for their products. I would never buy from them again 
 I tried to force myself to the end of this book, but I couldn't. I enjoy mysteries, but there is no mystery here. I figured out what was going on in the first half of the book, and the prose was so bad that there was no reason to finish. Cornwell could use a class in creative writing or a good editor. Her style is amaturish and grating. Her over use of adverbs, tinny dialogue, and sloppy construction were annoying to read. If a character was about to disclose something important, Cornwell made sure you knew by telling you how important what they were saying was in the dialogue tag--like the reader is an idiot. I am amazed anything this bad made it into print 
 If you love "A Prairie Home Companion," it is fun to watch top stars perform with Garrison, and I admired how subtly he wove Lake Wobegon stories into the dialogue. However, if you expect movies to have plots, this flick isn't for you. No discernable rising action or climax, and the resolution was limp, as if Garrison ran out of ideas to tie up the direction he took the material. I wish GK had instead presented his annual joke show. Don't let the movie fool you if you've never heard "A Prairie Home Companion." It is a 100% entertaining radio show. The songs in the movie are well-performed and I was impressed with the peformances. Woody Harrelson, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin can sing 
  Bands don't need to be different for the sake of being different, but I prefer when each CD a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them. X&Y is basically a clone of RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread. The same sound, the ethereal production, but now it's wearing thin because you sit there and say "Haven't we heard this before?" I don't really dislike the sound, but X&Y is just pleasant background noise. Here's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music. 
 As the previous reviewer wrote, this DVD only shows the NFL Films version of Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV.  It does also have a short profile of Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Chuck Noll, and a couple others.  They are only about 2-3 minutes a piece though.  The league season highlights are horrible.  Who cares about the other teams.  I bought this because it was supposed to be about the Steelers.  Wish I could get my money back. Gave it two stars instead of only one because of the profile on Lambert, he was the best 
 From a new grad student's perspective, i have to say that this book is absolutely terrible!!  The writers provided NO useful examples in the chapters and for the examples that are there, they never showed how they generated the results.  Its pretty obvious that these guys are not interested in teaching and that very little thought was put into this book.  I would recommend this book be banned from the classroom 
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
 Please note that this 2-star rating should be read as "fair," not as below average. Here we have a reasonably interesting straight chronologic hagiography that I would recommend for readers who (like myself) do not know much about the period in question. If you don't know much about Roosevelt already, you will learn some things. If you, on the other hand, are at all familiar with Roosevelt or any of the contemporaneous social or political movements, you will not find much of interest here. I did not enjoy the book much, largely because Morris simply does not seem to have anything to say, though he has enough to relate to fill the pages. With the magnificent, strongly opinionated Johnson (number 2) biography by Caro, this book stands in relation as a USA Today squib does with a New York Review of Books article. 1979, I assume, was simply not a strong year for American history books: "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" must have been awarded the prize by default: it's fairly long, manages (sometimes only barely) to keep the reader's attention, and contains nothing controversial. I wouldn't waste my time with it. The companion volume ("Theodore Rex") is not so boring 
 "Casablanca" is my favorite movie of all time.  I felt extremely happy when I heard that an original soundtrack of Max Steiner's great score was to be released.  However, my illusions became shattered when I bought  this CD because almost all the dialogue from the movie was included on this  Rhino release.  I felt so disappointed at that.  It would be better to buy  the movie instead 
 The title of this book is completely misleading.  Your money would be better spent with a subscription to "Tattoo" or "Flash" magazine.  There is no how-to information, and the various write ups on the tattoos are highly repetative (two of the pictures even have the same caption).  On top of everything it is poorly written, and the author clearly knows little about the art of tattooing.  It reads as though it was written by a 13 year old boy who worships his local tattooist.  The book is now being used to level an old coffee table I have 
 This book is awful.  It is full of speculations and just bad science.  I am going to quote one egregious example.  The comments in brackets [ ] are mine:  "Like the brain, the human eye also evolved opposite [really!] but complementary functions.  Each human eye is a perfect mirror image of the other; yet within the each retina there resides two functionally different types of cells.  With elegant symmetry, the contrasting functions of the rods and cones correspond to the division of tasks between the right and left brain [that is quite a comparison]. "Rods named for their cylindrical shape, are extremely light sensitive.   Distributed evenly throught the periphery of each retina, they see in dim light and appreciate [the rods have feelings??] the totality of the visual field, seeing images as gestalts.  Rods share with the right brain the ability to perceive [the rods can think??] reality all-at-once [as opposed to what, a little bit at a time?]. Cones, in contrast congregate densely in a small spot in the central part of the retina...Cones have two attributes.  They appreciate [there he goes again] color and intensify clarity [whatever that means]. Concentrating on one aspect of reality at a time, [huh?] cones view the visual field as if through a tunnel. [Actually cones and rods sense light together, at the same time, and your brain integrates and intreprets all that information into a perceived image.  But the most fantastic statement is the last sentance of this quote:]  Like rods, cones report to both hemispheres, but the left is metaphorically best suited to process their input.  [That is such an absurd statement that Shlain gives a footnote, right on the same page, contradicting his non sequitor.]"  And so it goes on for page after page of drivel, I finally gave up after 6 chapters.  A lot of reviewers find this book to be thought provoking.  I think it is a sad state that our appreciation of science is so dim that people can actually find this nonsense to be of interest 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 Instead of "How to Afford," the title should be "How to Build."  The book offers suggested contracts for construction, price and fee contracts, a materials description sheet, certificate of insurance, etc.  It is very thorough in what the log home builder will need to do it  themselves, but since I'm not a do-it-yourselfer it really wasn't what I  was looking for 
 If you want my advice before buying this one,  it's this: Save your money 
 The book, "The Framework for Understanding Poverty" failed to live up to its high expectations. Dr. Payne talks about helpful strategies to improve instruction, such as using graphic organizers, rubrics, and activating background knowledge. She lumps all people who live in poverty into one group, assuming that every student comes to school with the same life experiences. Some of the negatives about the book are that there are more generalizations, rather than facts. This leads to some good ideas but a lot of falsehood. Payne feels that teachers need to let students know that formal registry is their way to getting high paying jobs in the future, and this could discourage children and make them feel less about their culture and background. Although learning academic language is important for students to acquire, they should also feel that their language and culture is validated in the classroom, including their registry.  Dr. Payne focuses on the negative aspects of living in poverty. Instead, she should have addressed ways in which educators can look at strengths and experiences children living in poverty bring to the classroom. Her so-called "framework" is a far cry from what a framework should entail. It is also important to keep in mind that her own company, aha! Process Inc., published this book. She grew up in privilege so she cannot relate to those she is writing about. In order to truly understand Payne's perspective it is important to know that she is a Bush supporter and has contributed thousands of dollars to his presidential campaigns 
 this book is a huge disappointment. i expected more for my money . i am ready to redo my living room so i bought this book. i don't know the author, but the topic was what i was looking for. the book doesn't help me much. it's a scrapbook of living room photos & many of those don't look like the way people really live. and there isn't much real help in planning your own room 
 Lee Barkens book was a major dissappointment.  The overall content lacks the descriptiveness one would expect from a book of its title.  The reader is lead down an overly linear path of chaotic instruction, devoid of any explanation as to why the chosen method is presented.  Wireless Hacking is lacking of any alternative solutions which might highlight or better suit the readers specific needs.      Left with no wiggle room, the reader is lead to believe that the methods presented are the best and only available, which is  frequently false and completely misrepresented.   My advice is, spend your money elsewhere.  There are far better resources available than what Lee Barken provides 
 The purpose of In Love With Night is to examine both the legacy of Robert Kennedy, and America's continued fascination with his tragic family. It does this by giving a biography of the man through the lens of the times in which he lived. Particular emphasis is given on his relationships with his father and his brother Jack, but the meat of the book is the conflict between the `good Bobby' and the `bad Bobby'. According to Steel, Bobby Kennedy was not the angel everyone thought he was. No big surprise there. After all, who was the angel everyone thought they were? In the end, this book seems to be about how Ronald Steel thinks the Kennedys are overrated. Again, no big surprise. Skip this one and read any of the far better books on RFK and his family 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 Gates should have excluded the late Anatole Broyard from this book.  Broyard was certainly not a "black" man.  He looked white, identified as such, and his choice should be respected.  Broyard's memory  should not be subjected to "ethnic rape.&quot 
 Although I am a fan of this series, I found Adams' writing style to be monotonous, convoluted, and dull. It's a shame that the disorganized style of the writer prevents readers from being able to truly enjoy the half way interesting concepts addressed in his book. I think this is a fascinating topic, but unfortunately Adams was not able to pull of this type of book due to his ostentatious writing style. I doubt I would read another Adams book again, but if someone else wrote on this subject I would be interested 
 The chapters of Edmund White's My Lives may be named My Mother, My Hustlers, My Master, but he jumps from subject to subject with no transitions. He acknowledges his partner for being the first to hear what Edmund has written. But obviously the partner is no editor. The book should be titled My Digressions. Because White can vividly describe a person in few words, we think he has depth. He doesn't. His astuteness hides shallowness. His writing deserves better content. He writes to be read: He craves approval. When he sleeps with someone, he wonders how the lover perceives him. When he writes, he wonders how the reader will perceive him. He knows that all his life he has been able to charm people into loving him; now he thinks he can tell us everything, especially the things he considers disgusting, and that he will able to still self-depreciatingly charm us. "Here I am," he might as well write, "faults and all. Now love me. Or (preferably) not." After all his therapy he has not learned that no one can validate him except himself. How can we love-how can we read-a man with this much self-hatred? He has become what he fears most: boring 
 I had to read this book for a history class in college, and I must say it was a poor choice for the class.  The author throws out many obscure names, and expects you to know who they.  He goes on and on about the authors of the period and their respective eccentricities.  The reader is treated to countless pages about who so-and-so was friends with, and what tea party they attended that evening.  It simply fails to help the reader appreciate this remarkable period in America's history 
 Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common)  Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment. So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring 
 if you knew me, you would probably know that i love punk music....old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly..they days when epitaph was THE punk label..you know, the label with all the re-mastered classics, plus phenomenal newer acts   anyways, until recently, this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves...mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as "Punk." yes, this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise..which is great..i mean i would never buy this for just 2 decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo, but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched "punk o rama" since they contain very little punk.   epitaph has a great extension in Hellcat Records to appease the punks/skins...i would surely recommend that someone pick up the "give em the boot" compilations if they want punk rock.  now, the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find!   bottom line, if you want punk go to hellcat, if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this, the new phase of punk o rama. 2 stars because i dont really care for this, but it earns my respect 
 This waffle maker broke at the two hinge pins within one year of purchase.  Parts are not available.  Top is hinged to bottom with two small plastic caps that are poorly made at best.  Unable to repair had to throw it out 
 "If a nut on the wall is a walnut, what is a nut in the bathroom?  A pee can."  "Why did the baby cross the road?  She was stapled to the chicken."  Billing itself as "the mother of all joke books", The Jokelopedia has the apparent goal of turning your child (or grandchild, etc.) into a comedian.  Categorized by subject matter such as a monster jokes, classroom distractions, family funnies, etc., the book contains riddles, jokes, cartoons, and tips from famous comedians.  Many of the riddles have pun-ch lines consisting of puns:  some that I consider funny, and many of which adults will consider groaners, but will get a lot of giggles from 8 year-olds.    Although I tend to like puns more than the average person, as a practitioner of non-violent communication, I don't recommend giving this book to children.  I am concerned that roughly up to 10 to 20% of the laughs come at the expense of becoming desensitized to the suffering of animals and humans.  For example, there's a joke about a woman who buys a parrot, and to get the bird to talk, she buys a mirror, a ladder, a bell, etc.  She goes back to the store and reports that the parrot died.  The clerk expresses his sorrow over her loss and asks if the parrot ever said anything to her.  The woman replied that just prior to dying, the parrot said, "Doesn't that store carry any food?"  So the joke is that the parrot starved to death because the woman was too stupid to buy food in addition to all the accessories.  There are riddles that have punch lines at the expense of animal suffering, for example, "What's black and white and flat? A panda that's been run over."  And the tacky frog in a blender joke, mentioned by a previous reviewer, could give a child the idea to actually try this (likely very few children but it's possible).  Although much of the egregiously tacky material is in the "Snot funny" section, there is some in other sections of the book.  Another reason I don't recommend the Jokelopedia is because of the practical joke recommendations.  The child who tries out these suggestions will probably think he or she is being funny, but those laughs come at the expense of being rude and crude to other people, and insensitive to their feelings.  For example, one of their slumber-party jokes is to pour cold water over the shower curtain rod on someone using the shower.  Another is to put another child's hand in a glass of warm water to get him or her to wet the bed.  Yet another is to put some fake plastic vomit in the sink.  One of the elevator practical jokes is to bet the other passengers that you can fit a quarter in your nose.  Yuck.  Another joke encourages lying:  "Tell [your big sister] that one of her friends called (for this to work, be specific--use the real name of someone your sibling is close to and say one of the coolest kids in school is having a party tonight, but you can't remember all the details."  In case your budding comedian runs out of practical ideas to play on siblings and parents (yes, a parental practical joke idea involving the kitchen sink sprayer is provided--don't say you weren't warned!), there are five suggestions for tormenting the pizza guy.  One could, as another reviewer did, rip out some of the pages prior to giving the book to a child, or perhaps cross out portions with a thick dark marker like it's a government document.  (But if you rip out the page of slumber party practical jokes, the blurb on Lucille Ball is on the other side.)   Had I received this book as a child with pages ripped out, I would have been extremely curious about what was missing and sought out another copy!  Unless the authors write a new edition that takes out the practical and insensitive to suffering jokes, I don't recommend rewarding them by purchasing this book.  That's unfortunate, because I think some of the puns are very clever, and encourage children to have fun with the language. 
 "Star Wars: Spinter in the Mind's Eye" has Luke and Leia shot down on a Imperial mining world, and then racing against Darth Vader to find a crystal with great Force power.  I guess I am a product of my time, I really didn't like "Splinter of the Mind's Eye".  It didn't make any sense in the grand sceme of the "Star Wars" universe, and it was a dully imagined story to boot.  I know it was wrote just after the original "Star Wars" was a huge success, and it was an alternate sequel if "A New Hope" was not successful.  It also was wrote well before any of the other expansion books were; but it still just dosn't fit in with the rest of the mythology, though I realize it is not anyone's fault at all.  The idea of a crystal being a Force power source (kind of like a battery) was silly; the handleing of Darth Vader and his cory dialouge was bad, Luke and Leia are acting a lot closer than siblings and was really creepy (this could have been avoided; George Lucas could have stopped it).  And where was han and Chewbacca?  But there are a few good scenes, like the breakout from Imperial jail and the duel between Luke and the primitives.  All in all; it is a book wrote way before it's time 
 It's possible the women are funny, but I guarantee you the writing isn't. This is just awful. Big bold neon "laugh at the absurdity of this or that stupid foreigner stereotype! You'll never guess what happened! It was like, so weird, like, I mean, like, ohmygod!" I read 34 of its 200 pages, just because I was too lazy to get out of the beanbag and grab a better book. Six authors who can't write, and I have no reason to believe the others can. The intro by she who chose these essays also sucked. Don't waste your time. 
 Don't be confuse by Amazon's slick pictures.  The transmitter for the Sony Wireless Speaker is not included.  Misleading advertising.  Couldn't tell you if the speakers any good 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 The book is captivating. Kuhlman opens it with the words, "that which is contained within these pages is very sacred to those to whom these things have happened. Their experiences are too precious and too sacred to be shared with those who would read only to scoff, and listen only to deride."  Having read those words, I began the book with an open mind. As I read story after story of war wounds healed, sight lost in industrial injuries restored, and incurable cancer instantly removed, it became clear that this was a woman who undoubtably had power to heal!  And she always seemed to give the credit back to Jesus Christ. I finally put the book down, determined to find out more about this amazing woman. And did I ever find it. Kathryn Kuhlman was married in 1938 to fellow evangelist Burroughs A. Waltrip. They had been romantically involved for several years, during which time he left his wife and children to join forces with her ministry. Their marriage broke up in 1946, not long before she embarked on her healing career. She always went by "Miss Kuhlman" and publically denied ever having been married.  God is not the author of lies but the Truth. Kathryn Kuhlman's entire healing ministry was operated under the cloak of a lie. God could not have been behind it, powerful as it was.  Jesus prophesied,  "Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you'." --Matthew 7:2 
 See Jason Murphy's November 11 below for guidance ( not spiritual, but very worthwhile ). Mr. Murphy's opinion is right on with this reader's.     
 I was the Medical Director of American Samoa a few years after Mead's six month in Ta'u, a village in the Manu'a group and spent over two years there. On my trips to Manu'a I found and talked to Chief Tufele and those Mead worked with. With two years study of Hawaiian I was able to converse with them quite easily. Mead studied Samoan for only six weeks in Pago Pago. There are many errors and self-projections in the work of a 23-year old girl fresh out of college on her first field trip, but not enough to incur Freeman's wrath. About half of his criticisms are not true 
 In a word this movie was disappointing. It's supposed to be about beautiful Spaniards having sex on a magnificent Mediterranean island. Well there wasn't that much sex and the photography was nothing special. Add that to a plodding pace and poor plot and you don't get a very good fil 
 There are fifteen stories in this book.  However, I only found 5 to be good.  I was disappointed with the novel.  I suggest Beverly Jenkins' books if you want an excellent read 
 Usually I would not write a review for any book, but, I felt compelled after wasting my precious time reading this crap. This so called book is the worst collection of words I have ever had the misfortune of reading in my life! The author sounds like he has been stuck under a "religous" rock all his life and has to put his "brand" on everything about the greatest rock band ever. Grasping at straws in the dark, Mr. Friend tries to explain the reasons behind all the lyrics in Led Zeppelin's cataloge, but , instead, he makes a complete idiot of himself by taking a "holy-roller" high road in explaining the reasons of his beliefs. No doubt, he has done his research on Alister Crowley, but, some of the ideas he presents are completely assanine. For example: all of Zeppelin"s lyrics were written not by members of the band, but, by Satan himself. Or that the band wants to convert all their fans to Satanism, please. You would be better off by taking the money your going to spend on this book and flush it down the toilet. Thomas Friend should stop writing books and write a written apology to the band, or better yet, go crawl back under the rock from which he came. My opnion is based on the 102 pages out of 632 that I have read of this so-called book. Please be warned, avoid this piece of trash like the plague. Any serious fan of Led Zeppelin will feel the exact same way about this abomination. Pure blasphemy 
 According to V. Mansfield's excellent book, "Science Synchronicity and Soul-making," Abner Shimony is known for articulating the metaphysical implications of Bell's inequality violations. Experimental tests show that the properties of subatomic particles (spin, charge etc)  are invariably coupled or correlated, even at distances exceeding the  ability of information to be transferred at the speed of light. Therefore,  the universe is inherently non-local, seemingly discrete objects are  connected at a deep level, and any theory of the universe must take this  into account. Surely "experimental metaphysics" is important. But  I didn't learn any of that here. These essays, written between 1955-1989,  cover some interesting topics:  "Is observation theory-laden?"  and "Comments on 2 epistemological theses of Thomas Kuhn."  But  the writing is dense in the extreme, and oriented toward narrow specialists  in physics and epistemelogy. As the author puts it [p.304]: "The  argument of the preceding paragraph [a critique of Kuhnian skepticism]  misses many of the subtleties and important cognate issues that can be  found in the literature on the existence of external objects. (At least I  hope that this is so, for it would be depressing to think that such an  immense corpus could be distilled without loss to so small a  residue!)" Personally, I find logic-chopping tedious and unproductive,  and I vote "Distill!" Educated non-specialists looking for a  semi-popular book on quantum physics and philosophy should look elsewhere.  But if this sort of thing is professionally meaningful to you, Shimony  comes with high credentials.   
 Not a very good or entertaining book.  More of a ramblimg egomaniac's diary.  The book did not contain much detail on the events and jumped around way too much.  He tries to make himself into a heavy and when it got hot he turned 
 That's what I want to know. To all you men who are threatened by feminism, don't worry. We still don't get paid as much as you do, we still take your last names when we marry, and by the time Bush is through, we won't be able to get abortions either. Are male engineers and soldiers typically harrassed on the job, subject to domestic abuse, rape?  In nearly every society, men have universally assumed the superior role in every aspect of life (except, perhaps, childbearing, which they're not capable of doing). I'm sorry to hear that Thomas Ellis "losing patience with feminism, political correctness... and basically everything." To make it up to him, we'll all go back to be properly submissive housewives. We'll leave college, stop voting, and exist entirely for male gratification--just as we did before feminism. Will that make him feel properly superior?  Don't tell me that men are "the inferior sex" until wives take the wheel, husbands take wives' names, and a "First Man" finally graces the white house. It's time that modern women say "enough is enough" to yet another backlash against our dignity 
 I read most of the reviews on here and I also read enough reviews on other sites, including Mercola's to get an idea of what this book is about.  When anybody says "Don't Eat This..[ insert a natural food here ] " I tend to go hum-..  Grains as well as seeds, nuts, vegetables and fruits, animal flesh, have been around since the beginning of man.  The problem is, the industrial revolution allowed people to over consume all types of foods.  We became gluttons by our own devices which set in motion this belief system that huge meals are the norm. That is so, totally wrong!  In our past, and in many poor countries today, people walk around and pick berries, hand-harvest grains, kill their own meat and so on.  People ate smaller because things had to last longer and their weren't machines to supply foods to grocery store shelves so we could stuff or faces at all hours of the day.  I believe even a natural food source if eaten in excess can have some negative consequences.  Did you know that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli when eaten raw and in excess can block thyroid function? Who knew that something so good for us, when eaten in excess could be so bad for us. BUT this does not mean that natural, wholesome foods should be totally eliminated from our diet.  A portion of grain is about the size of your clenched fist, but how many Americans eat just that amount?  The problem is not eliminating grains, but eliminating over consumption and living by portion control.   I read a review on here from a doctor who claims that a vegetarian diet is the most healthiest.  Don't believe that folks.  Vegetables are extremely healthy for us, but not exclusively. I was a vegetarian for almost 10 years and I was not at my healthiest.  Most of the vegetarian groups and friends I knew were also skinny and sort of gaunt looking. It was only when I started eating a balanced diet including some animal foods AND high in vegetables, did I start to feel and look better.  Living long and being healthy is not rocket science...  - Eat lots of vegetables, include raw and raw juices. (lightly steam cruciferous vegetables to deactivate the thyroid-hampering properties) - Organic, raw fruits. - Nuts and seeds (raw), grains, legumes. - Organic chicken & wild salmon. Organic beef 1-2 times a week at the most, (if you like beef that is) - Plenty of fresh, clean water - Most important, PORTION CONTROL!  - Cardio vascular and weight-resistance exercise each day. If you don't use it, you'll loose it! - Quality sleep. 6-10 hours a day, depending upon the quality of your sleep and physical needs. - Avoid stress as much as possible. - Stay away from cane sugar, salt, tans-fats (hydrogenated oils), and junk foods, white flour products. - Avoid all types of alcohol.  - Don't smoke and avoid second-hand smoke. Yes this includes cigars and chewing tobacco.   The reason people have such a hard time with food and diets is the fact that they don't understand and live by portion control.  For example see how many of these do you over eat...  A portion of nuts is about 5-10. How many of you have eaten handfuls? A portion of fruit is one small apple (not the huge softball sized red delicious type). Berries about a handful. A portion of grains is about 4 heaping spoonfuls or the size of your fist.  How many of you eat a huge bowl of cereal? or eat all that bread, or tortilla chips at restaurants before the meal is served? A portion of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.  That is pretty small by American standards.  How many of you are a glutton at BBQ's? or eat those big slabs of steak they serve at restaurants? - That 'aint a portion folks! How many of you go to All-You-Can-Eat restaurants?     The Standard American Diet, stands for S.A.D. And sad it is. It's no wonder so many people are over weight and sick.  The key is-.. moderation, diversity (i.e. nutrient diversity), staying away from junk food, and most important... Portion control of our meals.

 My daughter likes the pictures, but the storyline is wierd.  I just don't like a story about a mother that leaves her infant alone in public in the care of her dog.  I also don't like images of a baby riding on the dog's back (and even standing on, in one of the other books), I certainly wouldn't want my child to think she could try that with our Rottie.  I know it is a kid's book, and supposed to be cute, but I just don't like the Carl books, and I don't think they send a good message about proper child care at all 
 "Journey to the West" is a literary masterpiece which has been loved in China for nearly half a millennium.  In contrast, "The Lost Empire" is a piece of meretricious rubbish which will hopefully soon be consigned to oblivion.  Its makers seem to assume, rightly or wrongly, that its audience will be unable to relate to a "foreign" story unless a white guy is inserted, however incongruously, into the action.  As if this were not bad enough, the idea of the "hero" comducting a romantic affair with Kuan Yin must be deeply offensive to many people of Chinese extraction.  Since Kuan Yin is someimes compared, in her role as compassionate mediator, to the Virgin Mary, one can only imagine the response had the situation been reversed.  This is an example of film-making at its very worst 
 The author of this book needs to check his research next time. He wrongly claims that the early settlement of Auraria grew into the present suburb of Aurora--page 45. This is completely incorrect. Auraria was located on the west side of present down-town Denver and merged with Denver in the mid 1800s. Currently the Auraria Higher Education Center, a tri-institutional campus, rests atop the former location of Auraria. Aurora can be found east of down-town Denver and is an independent suburb of Denver. There is no physical way that Auraria became Aurora. How can the author claim to know the hidden charms of Colorado when he demonstrates a complete lack of understanding regarding the state's history and geography 
 The Gutter and the Grave is a re-issue of an early McBain who had not quite hit the stride that makes him an immortal of the genre. Clearly dated (even given the fact that it was written in 1958) the dialogue lacks authenticity (a hard boiled detective lieutenant dismissing an obviously phony alibi as horse "manure"), and the realism of the 87th Precinct novels is clearly lacking. The overnight decent of the hero from succesful private eye to Bowery bum because of his wife's infidelity is a bit over the top as is machinations of the other characters. The prime suspect is jailed in minutes of the first murder and sits there  througout the novel's other murders( all committed by the same gun)  without seeking legal counsel ,the alcoholic hero who is always in full control of his faculties and apprently has not lost any his athleticism  nor his allure to every woman he meets in the novel taxes credulity. .  If "Gutter" is to be the last McBain, it was not a grand exit. I hope there is an 87th Precinct lurking somewhere.        
 I can't believe anyone would even charge money for this "map"!  It's like a handout you would get at a mall.  Poorly done, and minimal information.  
 I'm not saying i don't like slow music, but it has to be good. The only word to describe this album is: bland. It seems so completely uninspired for a band that is incredibly original. But there's still hope. The bands new album: SUPER EXTRA GRAVITY, which was just released in the UK, is a step in the right direction. They are back to writing densely layered pop compositions. THANK GOD. I thought we lost them 
 I saw the movie and thought the book must be even better...nope. It was like listening to a thirteen year old girl whine. It made me uncomfortable reading it she was trying so hard to be a good writer that I felt embarrassed for her. I stopped reading after chapter 1 and sold it to a book store for a dollar 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 order this item only if you do not need to use it immediately and can wait for a long time. i do not know how long because i am still waiting 
 The "Everything Grant Book" is not very helpful to those who are serious about trying to locate and obtain grant funding.  The book provides a very broad-brush approach to grant writing with limited examples.  The first seven chapters go back-and-forth between government and foundation grants, which is very confusing, especially for the beginning grant writer.  Even though government and foundation grants have some common elements, they require very different approaches.  When the reader finally reaches Chapter 8 "Components of a Grant Proposal," it really discusses solicitations, with only one page dedicated to grant components.  Chapter 9 provides very basic information about preparing to writer a grant.  Chapter 10 talks about "letters of support," which seems out-of-place considering the authors have yet to discuss the major elements of a grant proposal.  Chapters 11-15 discuss the real conponents of most government grants, but once again fail to provide a comprehensive presentation with realistic examples.  Chapter 16 "Other Grant Proposal Sections" includes information (staff qualifications, management plan, etc.) that really belongs in Chapter 13 "Action Plans."  Chapter 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 include very basic information about writing, reviewing, and filling out forms, and submitting proposals.  The book ends with "Writing Grants as a Career," which seems like an awkward ending.  If I had to rely on this book to give me the background to be a grant writer, I would be struggling to make a living.  I suggest potential grant writers look for a book that has only one emphasis (government or foundation), is better organized, and provides more contemporary examples.  
 When I picked up Fire in the Head, I expected to learn about Shamanism and the Celtic Spirit, as said on the front of the book. There is only one word to describe this description: wrong! Do not buy this book if you are seeking an overview of what it claims to teach. The whole book is mainly history and folktales, which are nice, but that is not what I paid money to read. There is minimal Celtic spirit in this book- instead, Tom Cowan does a good job explaining Celtic superstitions. There is little information regarding Shamanism. If you would like a good book about the Celtic spirit, I suggest you read Yearning for the Wind, another Tom Cowan book. I was amazed that the author of that wonderful book could also come out with Fire in the Head 
 I am mom to  5 year old twins Ryan and Freddie, both autistic.  I am mom to 7 year old Jasper, who has Down's Syndrome and to 11 year old Kelsen who has ADHD. Our house is quite challenging at times but we all pull together. I do not agree at all with these authors and their "SNAP" awards. Many of the toys they gave their coveted "award" to are NOT appropriate for children with special needs. A few listed in this book actually work against what a parent would use to try and reinforce positive life learning skills with special needs children. I think unless they have specially challenged children themselves or work with a group that does, that these authors  must keep their opinions as that. It is almost like they are awarding themselves for their thoughts on what makes a special needs toy good. The Oppenheim's  are not helping the special needs community by providing "awards" without research. I have seen them on the Today Show and I am not impressed at all. I brought this book up at a support group meeting and was actually laughed at for buying it. I guess I am not alone. I sold my copy (...)but sent a note along with this review should the buyer have a special needs child so I am spreading the word. The only thing I did find helpful in this book was the prices for each toy as a guide to learn how expensive toys have become 
 Sorry Troon, but you put a snowman up on this one.  What a big disappointment.  I loved the other Eddie C. books... I always tried to read one as spring approached to get me in the golfing mood.  But this ain't no golf book... and barely and Eddie C. book.  I feel like I was duped.  For others considering this as their next followup to The Green, The Foursome, and Scratch.... don't.   
 The program crashed during Setup. When I finally got it installed, it crashed my machine every night until I uninstalled it. 
 There were so many French spelling and grammer errors in this book that I can't judge the contents.  It was so upsetting to see even simple words like "Incroyable" misspelled that I couldn't concentrate on anything else.  I read this book with a red pen in my hand and finally had to stop editing it because I was so enraged by the author's sloppiness.  Ten years in France as a farmer and she doesn't even know the gender of the French word  for MUD?  Her children suppossedly were fluent in the language and not one of them could proof read her book?  I'm assuming that the publisher is a vanity press.  This is the only way this garbage could have been printed 
 The picture quality is worse than that of the reruns on TV [Analog Cable, "Low" definition]. The fact that the show is from the 90's isn't an excuse - I've bought DVDs of show from the 60's [some of them "colorized" B&W], and they look much better. I agree with all the criticisms about the theme - even if they couldn't get the rights to the original theme, they still could have found something much better. Hopefully when they release the other seasons they'll do a much better job 
 There was a renewed interest in Mencken over the last few years, partly because of the release of the remainder of his literary estate.  Along with that, came a couple of biographies, one by Hobson and one by Teachout.  I've read both biographies and made my way through about half of this self-collected work.  It boggles the mind that Mencken had (or had he?) the impact that he was supposed to have had during the 1910s through 1930s.    He was wa racist and a bigot.  Many of the pieces in Chrestomathy are culled from his "Prejudices" series.  Prejudice implies having some experience to base an opinion on.  Here is a man who rarely set foot outside of Baltimore, except for regular trips to NYC to meet with his publisher.  He said pretty nasty things about Jews (despite Knopf, his publisher and alleged friend, being one), and blacks (at one point claiming that the only intelligent blacks were those who had some white blood introduced by the massa during the good old days of slavery).  He lived at home with mom and his siblings until she died, and lived in the same house except for a five year period when he was married (in his 50s).  Oh, he did visit Germany a few times -- his family was of German origin and Mencken seemed to have the idea that the master race was reflected in himself - this boozy, narrow-minded fireplug of a man.  Not having a basis in fact for many of his prejudices, that leaves him a bigot.  He was ignorant.  He was smarmy and thought himself (and those like him) better than just about everybody.  He wrote nasty things about his "friends."    So, why is everybody interested in what he has to say?  He was considered an iconoclast because he wrote what he thought.  But once the shock value is gone, all that is left is some great writing (vocabulary, grammar, style) with some crappy content.  What he thought might have reflected his times, but my sense is that his times were really the last 1900s, not even the times when he wrote 
 This book is a travesty on the author and on Irish women.  The author obviously did not get in touch at all with the Irish culture and how she herself was being treated.  There is a long tradition in Ireland of making fools of 'outsiders' - Irish literature is full of such pranks.  The author obviously fell into the trap. This is not a good description of how Irish women live or feel.  I actually laughed out loud at some of the dour parts - the author did not get the satire or the tricks behind some of the women she interviewed.  One needs to be very subtle to talk to the Irish - talking everything at face value is a mistake 
 I own a Swiffer Wet Jet, and I am sorry I wasted my money. I don't know how effective this is on other surfaces, but I use it for my Brazilian Chestnut Hardwood Floors. Along with the cleaning solution that Swiffer markets for Hardwood. I use this product exactly as instructed and my beautiful hardwood floors costing over $40,000 come up with smears and smudges like you wouldn't believe. I realize that this is a cheap quick fix for dirty floors, but when you add in the fact that you contnually have to buy pads and cleaning solutions, it really isn't all that inexpensive the ONLY thing this product has gong for it is it's convienence, and technically, since I have to go over all of the floors again after using it to get rid of the smears and smudges, it really isn't that convienient either. So really this product is a BIG DUD for Hardwood floors at least. 
 they used the same formula for this disc as the did on their 2nd album but the material on here just downright SUCKS while i enjoy "sing a mean tune kid" and most of the "travel suite" tracks but as far as the other material goes it is just not good at all they reall blew it with this one sorry guys but i will give them credit for tryin 
 I read this book hoping for a fair and balanced critical review of modern business.  I found it to be little more than an attempt to justify a position that "all big business is bad".  While that may be true, Ritzer spends a decent portion of the book using invalid arguments to support it.    For example, Ritzer claims that McDonalds hires young people "because their minds are more easily controlled than adults" (no mention that they worked cheaper), and was critical that McDonalds did not foster "creativity" on the job.  Personally, I don't want teenagers to be creative with my food . . . and it seems it's not a bad idea that they learn a little discipline at work and as they mature and learn to make better decisions they can find jobs to be creative in.  Another criticism Ritzer uses is that universities "control" professors by setting a time schedule for classes - this is obviously not an attempt to control professors; it is instead the only way students can attend more than one class per semester.  Maybe I got turned off in the first chapters with his comparison of McDonalds to Hitler's gas chambers, could he have found something a little less sinister to compare it to?  That said, the argument that society is irreversibly changed because of industrialization . . . for better or for worse is certainly is a valid point . . . I just want to hear it argued with a little more critical review and common sense. 
 Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. "I Wish" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled "O", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. "Touch" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget "Growing Pains", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career 
 This set of books is always recommended and revered, but I always thought the language and Junie's actions and tantrums were atrocious.  I too found myself trying to substitute words for more parts of the book than we could read.  I kept thinking, maybe my daughter is not old enough.  Well, I am now thinking she will never be old enough, I mean I am shocked by these books.  I agree that it is essential for children to develop a love of reading, but let's do it with Jack and Annie (The Magic Tree House), or Cam Jansen, or something where the children do not act like the deliquents we all hope our children do not bring home as their new best friend!! 
 After reading this book, I would reccomend this book for teens.  In my opinion, this book was very amusing!   The most amusing part to me was when Rob was at the Rutland Fair looking for perverts.  I also think that this book was very easy to relate to  since I'm a teenager and I know what Rob was going through.  I have troble in school just like Rob did in Laungeuge Arts when he got a "D".  This book had very good dialect that went along with he book.  It made the book more interesting and kept me reading.  Therefore, I would like to reccomend this book to all who enjoy the "Comming of Age" theme in books and literature 
 In 1957 Ayn Rand published ATLAS SHRUGGED, her epic novel of individual freedom versus the mass state.  ATLAS SHRUGGED contained "Galt Speaks," a lengthy speech in which John Galt (the protagonist of the novel) sets forth the basics of Rand's philosophy, known as Objectivism.  FOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL (FTNI) contains "Galt Speaks" and philosophical portions from her fiction.  It also includes a lengthy essay explaining Rand's philosophy of history, which will be the focus of my review.  Rand starts FTNI with two characters she believes define most of history: the Witch Doctor and Attila.  Attila rules by force and the Witch Doctor is his "ideas man."  History is largely the influence of the Witch Doctor on Attila.  The supreme Witch Doctor of the ancient world was Plato; the chief Witch Doctor of the modern era was Immanuel Kant.  Their antipode is Aristotle, the philosopher of reason and the real world, whose philosophy unfortunately contained elements of Plato's otherworldliness.  Through most of history the Witch Doctor has been calling the shots.  However, Aristotle's philosophy hasn't been completely forgotten and emerged, due to Thomas Aquinas, in the Renaissance and in the founding of the United States.  Ayn Rand purged Aristotle's thought from its remnants of Platonism.  With the publication of ATLAS SHRUGGED a core of new intellectuals is being formed, ready to save the world from irrationalism.  "Aristotle, Aquinas and Ayn" as Rand once put it.  Or, as one Objectivist thinker said: "The big three [Plato, Aristotle and Kant] are now the big four" adding, you guessed it, Ayn Rand to the list.    FTNI follows the Attila/Witch Doctor description with an analysis of the history of philosophy.  Rand critiques numerous philosophers and their influence on history: Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Comte, Spencer and others.  She gives little evidence that she has read any of these thinkers, much less understood them. For example, she says of Kant: "An action is moral, for Kant, only if one has no desire to perform it . . .  (p. 32)."  Where, Miss Rand, does Kant say this? Or, "[t]he prelude to the Renaissance was the return of Aristotle via Thomas Aquinas (p. 23)."  Doesn't she know of Aristotle's influence on theologians who influenced Aquinas, such as Albertus Magnus?  Moreover, in her praise of the Renaissance (which she claims was essentially Aristotelian) she is oblivious to the fact that the many important Renaissance thinkers were Platonists.    There isn't much good I can say about FNTI.  While reading it may encourage you to take an interest in philosophy, the hatchet job she does on individual philosophers, schools of philosophy, and their influence on history is likely to set your study of philosophy back by years.  Sure it's exciting to think you know something about history that hardly anyone else has knows, even those with doctorates in philosophy.  That's probably why FTNI and ATLAS SHRUGGED were the most exciting things I read in high school (with the possible exception of WORLDS IN COLLISION, where I learned that Earth almost collided with Mars and that Venus was a comet shot out from Jupiter). 
 When I read some of the 4 and 5 stars ratings on this movie and some of the "Best movie ever" comments I was wondering if Amazon sent me the wrong movie... a mistake? But no, it is Casshern, so I guess my copy of the movie didn't come with whatever Amazon sent the others to smoke. Which you will really need to "enjoy" this mess of a flick... The bottomline message of this movie? Everything we do affects the other people living on this planet, that we are al neighbors, fathers, mothers, brothers, boyfriends, girlfriens, etc... Why a bunch of scenes that never connected one with the other and an impossible plot was needed to tell this? Ask the director and writer... Hey, you may ask the ones that gave this movie 4 and 5 stars!!! I LOVE japanese movies of all kind, in fact I only watch foreign movies with the exception of a few Hollywood, so don't think I am being a close minded Hollywoodesque guy! This movie SUCKS don't waste your money... or your time if you were thinking to rent it 
 I was expecting something more like a SUNSET magazine type presentation...this book is not a "how to" manual on building an oven.  In fact, the directions given were so poorly presented that it felt like I needed to hire these guys to do the job.  Outlines, guidelines, drawings or anything else one would expect for buildiing a brick oven were completely lacking.  The bread portion of the book is well...okay, but it has been better written and done elsewhere.  I would pass on this book and keep lookin 
 Unfortunately, my experience with this product is less than stellar.  For one, I am a very hairy man.  A VERY HAIRY MAN.  The look was completely different from the picture.  Secondly, upon closer inspection of the product pictured, it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front!  That must be what they mean by super sock.  Anyway, when I crammed my package in there, it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole.  Lastly, watch out for the string...it gets stinky 
 Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn 
 We got this for our son for his second birthday.  He loved it but we had problems right away that it didn't recognize when it was the dump truck or fire engine like it was suppose to and would just go off for no reason.  Of course we had an awful time trying to sneak it away from our son.  We went to the store to get another and the one they had didn't work either.  Buy at your own risk 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book because it was supposed to deal with the emotional aftermath of an extremely difficult issue (abortion more so than the clinic shooting) faced by a young girl with an unwanted pregnancy.  Rather than discussng this topic in a meaningful way, the book spiraled down into extreme pro-life propoganda and ended up sounding completely ridiculous.  Basically, the basis of the book consists of the following:  Abortion doctors are alcoholics, operate on their patients while drunk, and molest their patients because the patients "don't have any virtue left anyway."  Abortion clinic owners get filthy rich from running abortion clinics and abuse their spouses.  Abortion clinics purposely make women wait to have abortions until the fetus is more developed (even if the woman wants the abortion right away in the first trimester) so the clinic can sell fetus body parts and make more money.  The state health regulators let abortion clinics do whatever they want and ignore any applicable health regulations.  The pro-life advocates, who are all perfect angels, are really the ones who get threatened and harassed and are being unfairly blamed for threats to abortion clinics.  In fact, the shooting at the abortion clinic in this story was really masterminded by the abortion clinic owner to get rid of the drunk doctor.  This book was SO extreme - and is admittedly a story of fiction - yet continued to set forth certain scenarios and statistics as "truth."  I found it embarassing and the prose was not written particularly well.  It does not contribute to the abortion debate in any meaningful way.  I am going to see if I can return this book to Amazon.  I wanted to give it no stars but Amazon makes you have a minimum of one star 
 Based on my personal experience, I have a hard time buying into this persons process. While it was a good read, and Dr. West is a talented writer, I don't believe for one second that DID was experienced by him other than as an interesting writing tool 
 "The Home Organizing Workbook" by Meryl Starr is the type of book that is design to catch the reader attention of the shelve. But, once the reader takes a close look at it. The reader begins to realize that while it has some useful information there are better organizing books on the market. If you are interesting reading it, just check it out, and save your money 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 Gays have been remarkably successful and promoting their social agenda not just in the US, but throughout the industialized world.  The last great obstacle they face is overcoming religious prejudice against their practices, so it is not surprising that when confronted with scripture that unequivocally condemns same-sex sexuality, they put themselves through all manner of logical and interpetive contortions to show that the Bible doesn't really mean what it says quite clearly.  There is little point in going through the book argument by argument and offering a rebuttal.  And I will say right off that in a way I agree at least partially with the author, when he says, for instance, that we should try to understand biblical teaching within context--historical/cultural analysis is a valid method of scriptural analysis.    But the author claims, outrageously, that we modern-day Christians are interpreting biblical prohibitions against homosexuality  from a position of our own cultural bias. Nothing could be further from the truth.  That people during biblical times didn't recognize homosexuality as a "condition" (for lack of a better word) isn't particularly relevant, since they weren't codemning BEING homosexual, but ENGAGING in homosexual sex.  And this is pretty much the Catholic church's position today.  It is not a sin to BE homosexual.  It is a sin, though--borne of a "grave disorder" over which the person may very well have no control--to engage in same-sex sexual activity...just as it is a sin to engage in pre-marital sex, adultery, and so on.  It is a given, speaking from a Christian perspective, that people are borne imperfect and subject to all manner of temptations toward bad behavior.  How we act on those temptations is entirely up to us, though.  That we experience impure impulses is not proof that God wants us to indulge those impulses.  Which leads to an important part of Helminiak's argument.  He offers this:  1. Some people are born homosexual. It is a condition over which they have no control, like skin color, and height.  2.  According to scripture, God creates us.  Therefore, God creates homosexuals.  3. If we regard homosexuals as flawed, then we must assume God created them flawed deliberately.  4.  This would make God evil.  5.  God cannot be evil.  6.  Therefore, homosexuals must not be flawed.  7. If God did not create them flawed, he created them correctly.  8. God would not condemn what he created correctly.  9. Since God created homosexuals correctly, and does not, therefore, condemn them, it is wrong for us to condemn homosexual acts.  Sounds reasonable, right?  It's not, though.  First, #1 is never proved.  You can't assume a major premise unless for all practical purposes it is recognized as factual.  It must be widely accepted, or arrived at inductively in the argument.  The author provides no evidence to establish his major premise, that homosexuality is an inherent and immutable trait like skin color; he merely offers it as fact. It isn't a fact.  And there is plenty of reason to doubt his premise.  Once the major premise as been destroyed, the whole argument becomes moot, invalid.  But let's continue anyway....  He goes on to assert that God created homosexuals, and would not create people he knew he would condemn.  The idea of predestination varies among denominations, so I don't even want to go there.  What all denominations agree on, though, is that we live in a fallen world, and that all people are prone to sin.  It is as easy to say that God creates the pedophile, the dog-raper, the serial killer, and that we are foolish for considering these people flawed, because God created them.  Clearly, though, we are not wrong to consider these people flawed.  And just as clearly, God does not want these people to molest children or dogs, or murder their fellow humans seriatim.  Unless God is evil, which Helminiak already agrees he is not.  So Helminiak's argument falls apart because the principle he relies on is far from applicable to other other circumstances, other people.  To say God created man is not to say that God micromanages the creation and growth and daily actions of all people, or condones their poor choices and immoral actions.  Helminiak happily dispenses with reading scripture figuratively when it suits his purpose, but here seems to adhere to a level of literalness that I don't encounter outside of the strictest sort of fundamentalism.  He isn't consistent in his argumentation.  This is a book by an author who clearly knows ahead of time the conclusion he wants to arrive at, and seeks to find a way--any way--to get there.  He's not alone.  This isn't the only book I've read on the subject; the others make similar arguments, deliberately misinterpreting the koine Greek of the NT so that, in their minds, they can believe that when Paul condemns men who lay with men, what he is really condemning is men laying with male prostitutes, or boys.  But these interpretations are without foundation and fly in the face of the overwhelming bulk of biblical scholarship.  As an interesting insight into where Helminiak is coming from, consider what he has said in a PBS interview:  "I can remember the first time I deliberately went and had sex with someone. It was somebody I had known, who had approached me ... and I was being sympathetic because he's telling me he's gay... I thought God was happy that finally I got off my duff and did something. God said, 'Yay! Finally you're growing up! You're starting to live.'"  Say what?  An ordained minister of God, who has taken vows of obedience and celibacy, goes out, has sex with a man he met in his pastoral capacity, and God says "Yay!"?  Is this guy SERIOUS?  The Bible's prohibition against homosexual sex is not a cultural convention of an ancient people. The condemnations appear in Paul's vice lists.  Scripturally speaking, homosexual acts are, simply and unequivocally, vices to be avoided.  If you want to know what the Bible REALLY says about same-sex relationships, read the Bible, not Helminiak.   
 Thanks to all of you for the input!  I was interested in this product as a x-mas present for my parents...great price and liked the fact that it was 5.8ghz... however, because of your reveiws I will be going elsewhere.  Thanks again! 
   God, this movie was....lame. I mean, it was lame. It limped; it struggled, it staggered.   I lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes.  The really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed? Check. The sleazeball guy getting killed? Check. The sleazeball guy practically begging for death? "Here, doggie..."?  That's eighty minutes of my life I'll never get back.  
 ...and were just looking for a legitimate excuse, you should definitely read this book. Any Red Sox fan who was devastated by his defection to the hated Yankees should definitely give this one a whirl, as you will come away thinking, "Good riddance." You also come away with the understanding that for Johnny, it's all about himself and it's all about the money.  What this book is NOT is a good behind-the-scenes look at the 2004 Red Sox. You get a few good bits, but not enough to justify the price of the book. What you get a lot more of is Johnny Damon being repulsively full of himself. His statement that "I banged 9 women during my wife's 36-hour labor" was absolutely appalling and morally repugnant. Then he has the gall to blame HER for their divorce because she was "too paranoid." The book was pretty badly written and was full of typographical errors and factual mistakes that every casual fan will pick up on. I knew from previous input I had from others that I might not like the book, but I didn't expect to come away flat-out hating the guy. That is what this book will do to you. The degree of selfishness and boastfulness is nauseating.   Please save your money. If you MUST read it, get it from a library 
 This is the kind of information my therapist of 4 years spewed...then I found one who offered practical guidework and here I am...a healed child. 
 I bought this book recently and opened it, full of enthusiasm, ready to read. However I found that it's more a pathology than pathophysiology book. It tries to mix the two subjects and as a result it does not cover sufficiently either of the two. It is nicely organized though and may be good for other health sciences, but NOT for medical students! Many of its pictures are "borrowed" from Robbin's Basic Pathology 7th ed. by Kumar, Cotran et al 
 It's a wonder how people (99% anonymous) can write glowing reviews of this book and throw around words casually like "compelling", "powerful", etc. It's also a shame to see people so blindly read the INTERPRETATION of what this woman read as being her grandmother's history.   Another point about this novel - Who cares! It's a book about her supposed discovery of her heritage, of which she researches, writes, gets published and gets paid for. Does your story really warrant a book? Why don't the lot of us do exactly as Ms. Lee does and discover our own lost heritage, write about it, and package it as our own [insert background title here]? Apparently since her publishing, the likes of which people strangely lap up and call "amazing", Lee is now on the lecture circuit, going from one university to another lecturing on this. Is this for real? Is she now a certified expert in Korean history? Do not pass Go, do not collect your PH.D in History, instead write a fictitious book based on archival information and go straight to expert? Give me a break. This book is contrived.    1/5 stars. 
 I have never been a fan of little JT.  However, I saw the video for this song on VH1, so I figured what the hell.  It sounds like his vocals are processed through a microwave, then sent to Hades.  When you can make any singing out, he sounds like a girl.  As for the music, what music?  I love erratic sounds and industrial music, but this just sounds like about 20 computers crashing with two drops of power tools.  I am again reminded why I don't like Justin Timberlake.  HE SUCKS! 
 Shortened version: Don't buy this DVD unless you have an incredible memory.  Long version: My daughter started playing the DVD and sat and waited, because the actual dancing part wasn't for a bit. When the actual dancing part happened, Paige showed us about 7 dance moves then said do it. Of course, my daughter couldn't keep up. Then she showed us a whole new set of steps then said do it. After my daughter attempted to keep up on the second part, Paige told us to put it all together and do both parts. And yet again, my daughter couldn't keep up. It was when my daughter was watching Paige "demonstrate" the moves before doing them that I realized that my daughter isn't getting much excersize out of the DVD. I WOULD NOT recommend this DVD to anyone, especially to little kids, who would definetly not keep up to Paige's high memory rate 
 I bought this CD to relax me being a medical student, but this is the worst meditation CD that i ever bought. It's very boring and its very repetitive. I hate it. I wish i never spent that money on it. Not worth getting. 
 The authors commit a very serious fallacy in this book: they assume their own conclusion. They start out by believing that there must be miracles, pick out certain historic events as representative "miracles", and then go on to explain why they must have been miraculous. This is a waste of time with which no serious and rational person should bother 
 I ordered what I thought was matcha tea powder. a comment on the page said it was SLIGHTLY sweetened, no specific nutritional info was available when looking to order. on the info when the tea arrived was a calorie count of 393cal/serving, and ingredients which include corn syrup solids and partial hydrogenated oils. not what I was expecting from a green tea powder. would NOT recommend 
 Joseph Ellis is a learned, competent Revolutionary era historian. While this book is a fine introduction to Washington's role in the Revolutionary War era and beyond, it doesn't approach the caliber of David McCullough's John Adams or Edmund Morris' The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography. He doesn't seem to understand Washington - he doesn't get us into his head, relying instead on historical narrative. Ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of Washington's character. Admittedly, part of the problem of interpreting Washington is that Washington manipulated his public image, acutely aware that it would endure to all generations. The Great W. was scrupulous about his private life. But rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding, Ellis attempts to paper it over. His prose style, attempting conversation, yet creaks with scholarly habit. I bought this book, relying on the stellar recommendations here on Amazon, but it seems I must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader 
 Okay but does not keep cool for long. I do like the massage effect from the beads 
 Peter Fonda and Kurt Russell surfing a wave down a Los Angeles reservoir is not cool, does not make this movie worth a look, good God, that scene stinks. P-U. Campy. This movie is a mess. A horribly made sequel. So bad it actually tarnishes the reputation of the original 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 I thaught before my first trip i would read up on the drug so i purchased thisbook. I thaught it would be informative but it didnt help at all overall if u wana learn about acid dont read this book the only good part  about the book was when they talk about persona experiances on LS 
 I bought this book for my wife - a feminist, a mother of 4, a psychology graduate student, a conservative and a Christian. According to this book the down fall of motherhood is because of people like "Clair Huxtable", Princess Diana, Kathie Lee Gifford and the Christian Right. This author has some skeletons in her closet and carries her baggage through the whole book. This book was so jaded by this my wife was unable to read it. Here is an example of the bias in the book. In the center of the book are a few pages of pictures, here are two of the captions, "When Susan Smith killed her two children, she was widely vilified, and became a symbol of motherhood in peril. Smith got little sympathy for suffering from mental illness or for having been, for years, a victim of sexual abuse by her Christian Coalition stepfather." and "When Andrea Yates, a stay-at-home, fundamentalist Christian, home-schooling mother with five small children, drowned them all in 2001, much was made of the dangers of post-partum depression and psychosis. But many mothers also saw the tragedy as a warning sign about the tyranny of the new momism."  Typically I would resell the book here on Amazon, but in order to spare you... I threw it away 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 I read Kozol to actually be amused. It saddens me to think that colleges force students to read books like these. Young minds take this at face value. I am a native New Yorker, from Brooklyn. My parents were working class, and we had no extras. What I hate most about Kozol is his obvious white guilt. He never talks about personal responsibility. It is just the city not taking care of the poor and needy. That is the problem with most liberals, they offer opinions, work on the emotions of people, and never offer solutions. When mayor Giuliani wanted welfare workers to work, IE pick up leaves in the park, there was a great outcry-well, when I was in college, I worked cleaning up after horses-just to pay for part of tuition, and I waited tables, ETC. Why should they not work if they are getting a check? He also talks about how the suburbs spent more money per child in the school system-yet he never mentions what those parents in the suburbs spent each year on taxes--There is a lot more I could write, but I would be here all day. Take it from a native New Yorker who worked as a teacher in the South Bronx-he plays on your feelings, but in the end, by portraying poor people as victims he gives people a way to "blame the system," and insults every hardworking person who has improved his or her life 
 Don't take the star rating wrong - this is as good as any of the other books in this series, but this edition (Quiet Vision Publishing - paperback, printed in 2000) is the cheapest printing of a book I've ever seen. Only about 20 pages into it, pages started falling out of the back. The type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you're trying to read, and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes. I know they make an electronic version of this book. As part of my job I convert a lot of print-intended content to digital publishing formats, and that's what usually happens to em dashes during that process, so I almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it. It looks like it was printed on a laser printer (especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a 12-year old), and the fonts look like they're just PC-standard 'Times'. There are also several footnotes, which in the original edition that I read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from. In this edition they're in the back of the book 
 Not worth the price - bought another book at the same time that is indispensible 
 I wasn't spiritually filled with this film like other Jesus' films have done for me.   Started out ok but at the end it seemed that the director wanted to finish this movie as soon as possible.  I think maybe this movie was made more with human reasoning than "spiritual" reasoning. I don't like the way Jesus was portrayed here, uncombed hair and sort of ripped old dress. I believe Jesus was poor but He had more "presence" when He came to this world in the flesh as being the Son of God.  John the Baptist's character looks too old for the role, bearing in mind he was only months older than Jesus.  Ok, I could let those details pass, but then, what is Mary Magdalene doing with the Apostles?...in the last supper?... She was one of Jesus' disciples but that doesn't mean she was following Jesus with the 12 Apostles.  The Gospel of John doesn't mention if Magdalene was there with the Apostles during the last supper; however, Matthew (26:20) and Mark (14:17) DOES mention that; Jesus was there with 12 Apostles *only* so I don't see the *need* to include her at that private moment. This bothered me because this can make the assuming to some people that Magdalene could have been something "more" to Jesus which obviously she wasn't. Anyway, to me, she wasn't there as simple as that.  Other than that, a good Jesus film if you focus on His teachings only but not the best film for me.  Better films are Jesus of Nazareth, Greatest Story Ever Told, Passion of the Christ, The King of Kings. 
 This blatently derivative (hat tip to Ridley Scott's Alien, with a hint of Stanley Donen's Saturn 3 thrown in) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is, presumably, employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills. Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space. James Spader and Angela Bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot, but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull.  The "happy ever after" finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness. Supernova's only redeeming factor is that it is very short 
 WILL SOMEONE PLEASE SEND ME SOME INFO ON THIS BOOK! please!   i'm dyin' over here  if you read this please HELP ME!    you gotta help me i would read it but i can't stand the dang thing and it's soooo confusing. so if  you have any info at all i would really appreciate it a character list a  chapter by chapter summary any thing...my emial adress is dci80@aol.com    please help me 
 This text is one of the worst in terms of technical merit and correctness.  The author obviously does not have much of an idea about statistics and how to implement SPC... 
 I just saw the Derailers at the Beat Kitchen in Chicago. I was so excited to finally be getting to see this great band. Well the band I saw was ok, but they should change their name because they are no longer the Derailers. These guys were pop-country want-to-bes with little remaining style, wit, humor, emotion or those beautiful harmonies I truly grew to love. I left before the show was over. I'll keep playing the albums I have because they are top notch, but as far as I am concerned the Derailers no longer exist 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 I was required to read this book for a class, and I can say without a  doubt that it is the worst book I've ever read. The author just keeps  throwing out various names and babbles on and on about stuff that doesn't  make any sense. Everyone in my class complained about how boring and hard  to follow it was. I promise that you would have a better time reading an  encyclopoedia - I only wish I could give it zero stars 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 I had read--with delight--the book called "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup.  Wrong! It barely resembles the book, and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out. It might be OK for a child who hasn't read the book, but we were disappointed 
 This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!! 
 Probably very informative, but so dry and statistical that I have skimmed over it, but haven't read the whole thing yet 
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 Growing up as a "boomer" in the 50's and 60's as I did was as transforming an event as the transition from the 20's to the 30's for many, and Kerouac was one of those whose writings captured that transformation for me and millions of others with his "On the Road" best seller in 1957. He had his detractors like Capote who sniffed at him as just being "a typist" but millions loved his break from the suburban swamps and into the "beat" generation which he had named, doing drugs, experimenting with all kinds of sex, and just adding to the general adolescent rebellion that took form in the 60's in many ways. This book, in Kerouac's letters and other writings from his other friends, shows him to be a much different kind of person. A serious student of other writers in serious times, he was much more complex than "sex, drugs, and rock and roll". He was almost completely paralyzed by self-doubt for most of his life, and his alcoholism obviously took a toll on his brain before it killed him at 47. This book in the form of Kerouac's writings is most revealing. The problem with this book is its author/editor, Brinkley. Brinkley leaves out any mention of the journal Kerouac completed which is at the U of Texas in Austin, or his tangle with the law with Ginsberg, and many other misquotes and factual errors. But what this book reveals most about Brinkley is that he is really not the historian he holds himself out to be; he is just another hired gun, willing to write incomplete and misleading hagiographies for the right price, as he did for John Kerry or Jimmy Carter, among others.  Hopefully someday the Kerouac estate will allow a real historian access to the material they have and not leave it to someone who is willing to shave the facts here and there to make a work of fiction instead of a real story about a real man.  
 This book was a big disappointment. You spend the whole book waiting for the main characters to get back together, and you don't even really like them. If you're looking for a fun chic lit book, this is not it! 
 President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
 This is what occured when I heard this album. I immediately had to run to the bathroom and crap my life out. And guess what?!?!?!?!?! There was blood in my stool. Damn you jeffery for polluting this world with your awful lyrics, curse you for wasting beats, and shame on you for calling this album "blood in my eye" when you don't even know the history behind the book called "blood in my eye". Listen to us Ja quit rapping and go work at kfc 
 For whatever reason, the Religious Right dislikes the theory of evolution. It seems that their only goal in life is to "disprove" it (despite the fact that for 150 years they've been woefully unsuccesful). Sadly these people, Mr. Hangeraaff especially, have no knowledge about science or how to approach it. The "research" in this book is written with the conclusion already in mind.  His goal in the "research" is to prove what he WANTS to be true. This is NOT science. Science is supposed to involve drawing logical conclusions based upon evidence. If you already drew your conclusion before you began, as Mr. Hanegraaff clearly has, then why bother researching at all? Well in this case it's to give the illusion of "science", since even the religious right are aware that science is more believable than faith.  This book is a collection of half truths, deliberate lies, misinterpretations, and outdated beliefs and models. This is a prime example of someone with a blatant agenda spewing their own personal beliefs.  Evolution is currently 100% accepted by the respected scientific community, so where's the fire Mr. Hanegraaff?  This is biased nonsense and should be avoided by anyone who cares for true science, or for anyone with the ability to reason.  I'll end where I started: Why is evolution a problem for the Religious Right 
 what's that book about? rebellion? i don't think to be a rebel is necessary to have sex with everyone you meet, both male and female. is the intent of the author to shock you? he didn't shock me, he just disgusted me.  i didn't like this book at all, and if you are looking for a book with a meaning, you won't like this one 
 Bought one of these at Sears and was initially happy with it. But after a couple weeks of light use, the battery refused to charge. So I exchanged it at the store for a new unit. Used that one, again gently and according to the manual, for about a week--then it ceased working altogether. The player wouldn't turn on, whether on battery or mains power. Audiovox clearly has either design or quality control problems with this model. I suggest selecting a different model, and perhaps a different brand 
 When I first picked up Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  And, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  It is entertaining, the style works, etc.  On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book.  Probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the African American female. Packer has very little new to say, and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by Alice Walker and other writers, but have also have been said better by those authors.  Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down, a book that, while having its own problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text.  Even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.  The characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable.  The adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so.  The other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.  Similar to this lack of variation in her characters, Packer varies little in her narrative style.  Yes, the language is pretty at times, but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.  Finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative.  In short, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs you.  Packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out 
 Where to start with this bad movie?  As if the plot matters (it doesn't), the movie is about a woman and her sister who use hubbie's computer to access chat rooms, etc, and witness online killings, and of course, see the killer in a sort of "Eyes of Laura Mars" style.  The two lead males are played by non-actor musicians Roger Daltrey and Huey Lewis. Lead females are played by former actresses Natassia Kinsky and Nicolette Sheridan. The killer is played by a still-unknown actor.  Major problems:  1. Talking computers ("electronic chronometer activated"). 2. People talking to computers as they type. 3. Never making a typo even when typing at an awkward angle and not looking at the keys (while talking to someone else). 4. Easy access to talking encrypted computer by using a microphone that you have to be an inch away from to use. And the computer selects only some of the words you say, as needed. 5. Really bad acting. 6. Un-sexy eroticism. 7. Over-technologized thoughout.  It might seem tempting to "save" 5 bucks, but you're wasting the other five dollars. 
 If you're looking for actual pertinent, insightful and useful information you will be disappointed (especially if you are an introspective, educated person with any degree of insight into your own functioning and disposition) 
 After discovering and loving the sound of Gotan Project I was shopping around for groups with a similar sound.  I stumbled along Emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd, I thought I had found another gem.  Boy was I wrong.  The first track drew me in and left me spellbound, unfortunately, it was all downhill after that.  I was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on.  The rest of the songs were so uninspiring, the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise 
 More than I can count.  But since this is a short review of the book, lets stick to the one reason to toss this book into the recycle bin.  Clinton created a lean and mean military, not Bush.  Any success Bush and Rumsfeld have ever done is because of Clinton and his advisors.  Bush and Rumsfeld have never served in a war, nor have they seen combat.  Does anyone really think they could battle terrorism ? Not on their life and not on any of their rich relatives lives either. (Except for Bush Sr, who was a great president because he had actually seen war and combat.) Leave the wars to people who know about war and leave this author, who hasn't served either, to gather dust 
 I dont get this. A Tribute to songs not old enough to have tribute paid to them...but yet, they sound absolutly no different to Kid Rock's versions, just different singers.  This aint a tribute, it's people doing Kareoke... and tho it would sound good if you where actualy at a kareoke bar watchign someone sing these, you still wouldnt really wanna take it home and listen to it again and again.   This album is just a a big question mark 
 Good thing I received this book for free.  It was too wordy and wasn't well written.  For example, under mental disorders the author forgot to define Schizophrenia as he did with the other disorders - looks sloppy.  Also, the protocols for illnesses were nearly all the same; this book could have been 1/3 the size.  It started off with SOME good information, although nothing new, and had a nice personal success story.  Soon after that you get slapped in the face with its sales gimmick, which is difficult to get past.  Why?  Because it's difficult to trust informtion coming from a person who is going to benefit financially from his recommendations - 100% of the recommended supplements are from his company.  As a previous reviewer wrote, why didn't Rubin give us the products he used to recover - those before he created his own?  Rubin's focus on sales is too strong which makes it difficult to trust his recommendations 
 BUT if you are a Christian looking for what the Bible says about marriage you need to look elsewhere (there are plenty of excellent balanced books by Christians on this topic).   There is just enough Bible verses BIble principles in this book to fool most Christians unaware of the teachings of Christian Reconstructisim and its dangers. Wilson is a strong Reconstructionist--which is nothing less than Christian Nazism. God's Word has much to say about those cursing Israel.   This is SERIOUS dangerous movement followed by many leaders within the homeschool movement (see "The Road to Holocaust" by Hal Lindsey for a real eye opening about the Reconstruction/Dominion cult). Christian Reconstructionism is not Christian; it's a cult and needs to be treated as one. 
 I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read.  I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it.  I passed it on to a friend 
 This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.  This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!  The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).  The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.    The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a "good" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.   This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.  This is simply a mean, mean movie!    
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 Don't bother buying this.  It's pretty much a rehash of what's already been written by this author and others (often word for word).  Go the bookstore and skip to the section on the Lakers for anything you might have missed 
 As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.  Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).  Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see 
 OK, I love the Rev and I hate to talk trash about the new album, but it is a huge let down.  Granted it's still better than most other albums by other artists, but it lacks the guts of the other Rev albums.  The song writing and performances lack the depth of previous albums.  It sounds like they were thrown into a studio and told to put together an album in a week.  There are some good songs on the album - Indigo Friends, Callin' In Twisted - but overall it's just weak.  I saw them play about a month ago and they played some of the new songs.  The live execution was great.  Unfortunately it just didn't translate well to the album.  I'm all for the Rev stretching their legs and exploring new sounds, but in the past when they have done that (Space Heater, Spend a Night in the Box) it still had the depth and feel that the Rev is known for.  It may grow on me, but I listened to it four times in a row the day I got it, and it just didn't do it for me.  If I put together a Reverend Horton Heat "Greatest Hits" record, I don't think any of these songs would make it.  Sorry to be so rough on the guys -they really are an awsome band - but I'm disappointed that the new album lacks the guts and soul of they are known for 
 This book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than I am.  But while I was reading, I kept asking myself, "When's he going to get to the point?"  The first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something I thought was unnecessary.  The bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.  Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.   This was the only part of the book I was interested in.  To me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with "fluff".  However, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts.  I would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd.  I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise 
 A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and borin 
 I like ATL i think there album Uncle Samz Curze is a underated classic. But LEGENDZ???? not a classic, not even mediocre, da beatz sound strained and da lyricz are tired. This only getz 2 starz cuz of da song Adventurez Of... easily the bezt cut on here, and one of da bezt of dere career. If u truly love ATL cop this, if u dont, find a way to get Adventurez Of... and leave this alone 
 "The girl in a cafe" is a romantic story pretending to bring along a political message in the form of an ignoramus (main character - Gina) who is supposed to be the symbol of 'humanity'.  The movie starts off with an unlikely match of a British beurocrat fighting for the millenium goals to abolish world poverty starting with the G8 summit, with a (supposedly) charming girl he meets in a cafe, Gina. When she accompanies him to Rekjavik for the summit and as she learns more about his goals she becomes decidedly rude by attacking her beau's boss for not pushing for these goals hard enough. Not to mention, this bossman seems to be the only sensible character in the film, actually *trying* to make a change -- and not just having expensive breakfasts, dinners, and ranting to other people about not doing anything to make the world a better place (a.k.a. Gina).  And if this Gina character was supposed to represent Humanity, then I'm afraid the director/script writer has an oversimplified view of humanity itself. I don't think any average person on the street in any rich country wouldn't be heartbroken or at least quite bothered when he/she hears about how many poor children die everyday etc. But still nothing changes -- why? Not because those '8 men in the room' in the G8 summit don't care -- but because they represent the very nature of humanity of the masses they are ruling. Like Gina, everyone gets engrossed in their own lives and luxuries, but unlike Gina most of us would atleast appreciate the people who are spending their lives trying to make a change (i.e., the bosses of the 'Millenium project' that she attacks), rather than being blind to our own humanity while living off of luxury but maintaining this 'holier than thou' attitude. 
 S.E. Frost is either highly misinformed on Christian matters, or a liar. He states that we have never been able to answer the problem of evil and sin, which we have. He declares that we do not know who created the devil, and we do. He does have a couple of gems in the book, but if you are a Christian, or atleast open to truths, even the ones you don't like. I believe they would be better found elsewhere 
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 THIS COMPILATION FEATURES SOME OF THE WWE'S WRESTLERS PERFORMING THEIR OWN SONGS. AND JUST FOR THAT FACT ALONE, THIS CD IS DOOMED TO FAILURE. LET'S FACE IT, THESE GUYS CAN'T SING!!!!!! ONLY TRACKS THAT'RE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TO ARE THE DUDLEY BOYZ' ''WE'VE HAD ENOUGH'', JOHN CENA'S ''BASIC THUGANOMICS'', AND CHRIS JERICHO'S ''DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE ME''. EVERYTHING ELSE ARE JUST LAUGHABLE ATTEMPTS AT MAKING MUSIC. STONE COLD'S SKITS, WHICH ARE STUCK IN BETWEEN SONGS, ARE QUITE FUNNY. BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS STUPEFYINGLY BAD FOR MUCH OF IT'S RUNNING TIME, YOU COULD ALMOST SAY IT'S SO BAD THAT IT'S FUNNY. IF YOU LIKE WWE'S MUSIC, BUY ''THEMEADDICT'' INSTEAD. 
 Yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write.  My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading.  The following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes:  "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand."  One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  The result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  I don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and I don't understand why readers put up with it.  Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  Everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  I think you get the picture.  Few characters stand out on their own.  Even Lafayette is just another young officer.  The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  And Shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull.  Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin's mind.  But the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  Either I'm a lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well.  In addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington, Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America.  That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England, and the continental congress in America.  In effect, this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced.  Some aspects of the story are interesting.  I enjoy reading about Washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him.  I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  Most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold 
 I ordered this book as a means of sharpening flagging Spanish language skills.  I sent it back immediately, it was that bad.  First of all the book is tiny (which is an insult considering the price); secondly the biographies of the authors (written in English) are longer than many of the stories themselves, which isn't saying much.  Thirdly, though there are a variety of pre and post reading grammatical exercises there is NO ANSWER KEY, which renders all of the exercises meaningless 
 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 This product is a waste of money. The mice in my room are completely unaffected, and walk right by the device without any sign of concern. Besides being ineffective, the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound (not silent as advertised). I now have to buy a set of (humane) mousetraps, and I recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves $40 
 just awful  save your money, this book is not worth it. The pictures are dull and lifeless, boring composition. Mann hasn't captured anything here but a bunch of worthless photos. Any 10th rate amateur photographer could have done better. 
 The artist formally known as Vanity 6 is now an ordained minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Vanity 6 is dead but Sister Matthews lives to declare the glory of God!!!!!!! 
 I kinda had high hopes for this one. Just cuz I was expecting a genuine good movie rather than a flick with a holographic cover I got at blockbuster for a few horror laughs. I mean, the freakin guy from the show 2gether is in it. Anyway, horrible acting and what pissed me off is the direct ripoff of HO1KC. Shes a hitchhiker, wearing about the same thing as Baby, and is talking crazy, and even says 'I love this song' and starts dancing. Anway, the plot has about one sentence 'get stuck in the ride and walk around never really searching for a way out' thats about an hour of the movie right there. Honestly nothing happens. GREAT gore though I must say. and cute little plot twist at the end. Don't buy this though, borrow from a frien 
 This book was required for my MSME applied thermodynamics course. I was very disappointed by the layout, style of writing and even the content of this book! As an example, chapter 1 deals with the First Law of thermodynamics. It takes 45 pages to state 1 equation...the rest being useless information such as Poincarré's lesson at the University of Paris.  Every single student in class with me wished they had not bought this book. I would recommend for engineering students, "Fundamentals of engineering Thermodynamics" by Moran and Shapir 
 It is not often that I cannot finish a novel once I start it, and initially I found the world of the fringe-town psychic Alison Hart to be quite fascinating. Despite the squalor of her background and setting, Alison appears to have genuine gifts, together with a canny sense of what her public wants, and her relationship with her assistant, the much better-educated Colette, is portrayed with a good deal of sensitivity. There are also moments of welcome humor, quite wickedly so in the chapter surrounding the death of Princess Di.  But after reading to well beyond the half-way point, I realized that there was nothing to make me continue; I see from other reviews that I am not alone in this. The book lacks narrative thrust -- or rather its development depends too much on the various ghost characters that invade Alison's space. And here I think Mantel fails by treating these low-lifes in largely comic terms (Morris, her spirit guide, for example, is described as a "circus clown"), lower-class English types which seem to belong more to popular TV than to life. There are hints of trauma and abuse in Alison's childhood, and clearly the ghosts will turn out to have been connected to it. But I find it impossible to take such one-dimensional cartoons seriously as a way into the psyche of a character who has been established so clearly in the full three dimensions -- or even in four 
 Her choice of songs are wonderful, and I was going to buy the CD, for my personal favorite, "What are you doing New Years Eve."  After listening to all the songs, I decided NOT to buy the CD as I cannot stand listening to her taking a breath, into the mic all the time. Someone should teach her about not breathing into the microphone, in other words, learn breath control.  She has a beautiful voice. I wish  her well and I would like to buy one of her CD's. But, the ones that I have heard are all the same.  
 YAMAHA(it's a japanese company) makes many products, for example, ICs, pianos, keyboards, audio products.  The YAMAHA's best audio product is NS-1000M, a book-shelf speaker.  NS-1000M is the best speaker made in Japan in the history.  Unfortunately, NS-1000M is not sold now.  And more unfortunately, YAMAHA now has become a trivial maker.  NS-333 is only one of low cost speakers. or 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever bought.  I had to buy it for a college course and I am furious that my teacher used this one.  It is totally unprofessional and too general. Not only myself but others have complained about the  boringness and also but find it completely useless. It reads like a high school essay project with unnecessary sarcasims, endless repetition and examples that are really very weak and inept in the explanations.  If you are seriously considering pursuing an interest in compensation and benefits, do not use this book. Teachers: don't put any other students through the aggrivation and insult.  We are professionals looking to advance our careers not waste what little time we already don't have.  It infuriates me that I had to pay so much for a book that isn't worth $13.00 never mind $103.00 
 If you're the kind of person who considers themselves the true embodiment of the stereotypical All-American Hick, then this book is for you!  Instead of being realistic about the groom's expected wedding involvements, monetary terms are related only in terms of power tools, trucks, and stereo equipment.  Again, if you need words like: shyster, semolians, c-notes, and sawbucks, to understand what's happening in the real world, then... this book is for you!  Each sentence in this book is writtin to the absolute-lowest-common-denominator.  This book should only be purchased as a gag gift and might only be useful to those who didn't ever make it out of High School.  1 star for mildly amusing sarcasm 
 This is basically a pen that moves in and out. That makes it hard to draw carefully. We wound up cutting it off to draw the tattos. Then we just switched to using a sharpie marker. A cumbersome product 
 Fact of the matter is, even Lovecraft didn't pull off a good story every time, so it's even harder for people who write their own Mythos stories to do a good job. All too often, Mythos imitators misuse the conventions of the genre, with the mysterious elements brought right into the open so the writer's hero can solve them with some half-baked solution. This is in contrast to HP Lovecraft's stories, which mostly ended with the protagonist getting eaten by something or shooting himself. This anthology does not add much to what could have been the richest horror genre of them all. Instead, it just piles on more so-so stories that aren't innovative or all that memorable. It's not that the stories are universally bad, they're just so much less than they could have been, given the material the authors had to work with 
 This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego 
 The diamonds are waaayyy too small.  Nothing like the picture.  Sent it back 
 Be aware that when the author uses 'basic' in the title she really means it.  It is informative enough to bring the truly clueless out of the depths of darkness but those who seek to actually write children's book-- especially fiction-- would do better to look elsewhere 
 The Collector's Edition Soundtrack leaves out two great Rolling Stones' tunes She Smiled Sweetly & Ruby Tuesday. Also left to the winds is John Lennon's Look at Me, the Clash's Rock the Kazbah. The First Edition leaves a few tunes off too but it is a far better Soundtrack. Puckstar 
 Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read "The Myth Of Gender" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting 
 I think the fact that the average rating for this album is 4 stars is a bit of an inflation.  Don't get me wrong, I own all their recordings and love The Band just as much as anybody else, but this album, though it has a couple highlights, sounds mostly burnt-out and hollow, making it subpar (for ANY band) and WAY lower quality than we've come to expect from The Band.  I'll start with the negatives, since they mostly outweigh the positives, then move to the album's highlights later (please remember, I'm trying to take off the rose-colored glasses and be realistic about this album).  First off, as everyone knows, this collection of songs is, and never was, an album.  It's a collection of unreleased studio tracks strung together to fill The Band's contract.  Consequently, the songs weren't conceived as part of a cohesive whole and the album has no flow whatsoever.  Likewise, the rest of the album reflects this: a lack of attention, care, and soul.  By this point, a lot of Robbie's writing became really tired and forced--listen to "The Saga of Pepote Rouge," and "Let The Night Fall," and you'll see what I mean (spaceships?!).  There's not much inspiration, and he seems to be ineffectively trying to follow stock song blueprints that worked on their better albums.  The magic that buoyed Northern Lights - Southern Cross, making it one of their strongest records ever, is pretty much completely absent, which is a pity.  You can really tell on these songs just how bad Robertson wanted to be done with The Band and move on.  The playing is pretty similar.  The Band members go through the motions, passing around lead vocals, Garth plays a bunch of instruments (a lot of easy-listening sax this time around, not really to my taste), and Robbie contributes some pretty gnarly guitar, though it's not supported by well-written songs.  Although the songs are pleasant enough, there's not really much to get excited about, and it really sounds like the musicians aren't emotionally invested and inspired in making these songs as good as they can be.  On a final note, "Knockin' Lost John" reminds us why Robbie didn't and shouldn't have sung on almost all of the Band's releases.  Now on to the album's saving graces, since there are a few.  No matter how bland the songs and how uninspired the playing, it's still The Band doing it, which counts for something.  Even though much of their signature sound is being replaced with a more late-70's lite-pop production, it's still a bit of a pleasure to hear Rick's, Levon's and Richard's voices.  "Georgia On My Mind" is worth the price of admission all by itself.  Richard Manuel's voice was getting pretty haggard due to his hard living, but I'll be if it didn't add even more soul and texture to his always sublime vocals--I could listen to the guy sing grocery lists and probably still be entertained.  Robertson actually did write a couple decent tunes, like "Christmas Must Be Tonight" (although an arguably better version was already released as a bonus track on the superior Northern Lights - Southern Cross), and "Right As Rain" isn't too bad, though it really doesn't sound like The Band.  It's also pretty cool that Rick Danko helped out with the songwriting with "Street Walker" (Robertson always complained that he had to do all the work), even though it's not that great of a song.  Unfortunately, though, most of the album's good points are only mildly pleasant, and after it's over you get the feeling you've just listened to something with little substance that The Band cared about just as much as you probably did.  I'll probably get axed by hardcore fans for not giving it 5 stars, but seriously, it's not worth that many by anyone's standards.  If Islands deserves 5 stars, how much is Music From Big Pink worth?!  I'm glad I own it because of its highlights and because I'm a completist, but not everybody is.  Islands certainly isn't essential, but you might get some enjoyment out of it.  Just make sure you have everything else first 
 In a nutshell, you have a very slender woman whose spine is as flexible as overcooked spahgetti doing some very intense stretching for an hour, in her underwear.    One of the exercises had her squatting down, looping her arms behind her legs, grabbing her ankles and breathing in and out like she was giving birth to twins.  I guess that's some kind of mystical thing but I since I couldn't do it, I just sat down on the couch and laughed at it.  I sat on the couch for most of it.  If I were twenty, had her figure and her degree of flexibility, I would probably rate this production 4 or 5 stars; it is that good.  However, if you have trouble tying your shoes, this DVD ain't for you! My recommendation for us older folks is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People with Maggie Rhoades. It's a whole lot easier than this 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 This is, by far, the worst book I have EVER been forced to read. One star is too much. The title of this book, "The culture of education" leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education. He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. "Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection." What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as "immutable," Pontogenetically," and "Hermeneutic." If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell 
 I couldn't finish this book.  Don't we have enough stress at our own jobs without reading about someone ele's office stress times 10?  I had no sympathy for this character or anyone who would continue to work in such a hostile environment.  When I leave work, I want to read to relax and escape, not to take on the intense stress of someone else's work day.  
 I guess I should have listened to the title of this book a little more before I wasted my money on it.  This book is written for 12-16 year olds that have little or no knowledge of sex.  It has the most elementary stuff in it that even a person living on an island by themselves their whole lives could figure out.  I thought when I bought this book the author would be talking about techniques that would actually help achieve "amazing sex" as it said in the title.  Um think again.  It's like the author had some sort of agenda while writing this book.  She states that is normal to have "rape fantasies" and discusses "how to be comfortable being gay".  It is not normal to have rape fantasies and as for being comfortable with your sexuality I agree it is necessary for good sex, but don't waste my time with a whole chapter on it.  Honestly it's just false advertising naming the book "The complete idiot's guide to Amazing Sex", it should be called "The complete idiot's guide to the Basics of Sex from a leftist agenda."  There is nothing in this book that will help the reader achieve "amazing sex", just the basics that any simpleton could figure out.  Don't waste your money unless you're still in junior high 
 I came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization. Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I've suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ).   First let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to.  What happened?  How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? Johnson, where did you go?  Well, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge.  His take on America's military policies is ludicrous.  Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy.  Conspiracy "theory" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it's their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson's caliber to go there is incomprehensible. Unti you see what I saw.  The professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language.  For the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization.  No one. Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. They're frustrated, these authors.  I can't blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the've rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. the third world?  Silly question, really. You're at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.  
 If you're made to buy this book you have every right to hate the professor that makes you do so. This book is a punishment! Not only is it very expensive, but it also offers information that it is not relevant to the real world at all.  There are some positive sides in this book after all. There are quick references on almost every page to make it easier to follow the chapter; there are good graphs the explanations to the graphs as well as the general argument do fit (more or less). There are also case studies, a fairly solid web page, and self-assessment questions that are helpful to get through with this material.  However, the style is unnecessarily pompous, filled with theories that make no or only very little sense; the information presented is way to shallow to really understand what the authors are getting at, yet miraculously they manage to fill the book with more than 500 pages with endless waffle. In some places, the author's even contradict themselves, which is the most impressive thing about this book.  Generally only two stars are awarded for this book, as it really is a waste of money and time, however if you have to read this insult for any intellectual mind, you will find some help to make nonsense into a science. Good luck to you! 
 This book is pure nonsense.  I found it in our public library, a two-volume set from 1904.  It consists of poorly-written hearsay masquerading as scholarship 
 Now I probably would've given this movie 5 stars had it not been for the overwhelming number of people who rave about this movie and that it should have won Best Picture. But I'm starting to see that movies such as this are way overrated. This is just another arthouse type of film. Not an epic as is suggested by some reviewers. I don't care about homosexual issues in society, I don't care about those family relationships and I don't care that it didn't win Best Picture. This film is disjointed and I don't see how Heath Ledger's performance is so great. I could barely make out a word he said. Throughout the whole movie Ledger and Gyllenhaal speak with fake, texas cowboy accents. But I guess these are the types of performances the academy unfortunately respects so much. Oh well. 
 I am very pleased that we are getting back to the roots of religon > intolerance for ideas other than our own.  That is what this church was founded on right.  Jesus couldn't stand them "non-believers" and  Romans, so he told God, "Come and get me lord" And he did!   I  can't believe schools won't let this book in as a required textbook for  students.  I guess it must be them EVILutionists that are brain washing  people into thinking sinful thoughts.  I just pray everyone will someday  think just like us so the world will all be the same and we can finally get  some salvation around here.  It is my hope this book will help people  become more intolerant of others beliefs and wishes, just like the lord  wants it 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 Memoirs can be enticing and addictive. In a bookstore, I always give new ones the once-over in the hope of finding a good story. I've read many enjoyable memoirs, including "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius;" "Running with Scissors" and "Dry;" "A Child Called It," "The Lost Boy," and "A Man Called Dave;" and even `A Million Little Pieces," which, though riddled with falsehood and deceit, still managed to be well written and thought-provoking.   I picked up "Girlbomb" thinking that perhaps I had found a book of similar caliber. Regrettably, I felt that the book fell well short of not only my high expectations, but also of what could even be considered a mediocre read. Erlbaum failed to endear herself to me, not just once, but repeatedly. A large portion of her problems seemed to stem directly from her own behavior. The promiscuity, the drug-habit, the partying, all did a great deal to further complicate her already bad situation. But she either did not realize this, or did and refused to accept her share of blame. Her trial and tribulations came across as shallow and petty: the violence was less like violence and more like quarreling; the racism was less like racism and more like squabbling; the abuse was less like abuse and more like neglect.   That's not to say that she did not face difficulty and hardship, but even these parts seemed shallow and transparent. Sadly, there is little here to compel feelings of concern or even interest. Erlbaum herself seems to be indifferent, failing to communicate anything redeeming from her years spent in misery. The book comes across as resentful, bitter, and self-pitying. Erlbaum does not appear wiser because of her experience; she does not appear to have gained anything from her ordeal. The book lacks sincerity and earnestness, and winds up being tiresome, tedious, and ultimately forgettable. 
 The book "Child of Fire," by Scott O'Dell is not a book I recommend to young readers. This book deals with topics that readers who are not mature enough might not understand. For example violence and drugs  are strong topics dealt with in this book. There is also a part in the book  where the topic of abortion is mentioned. This happens when Manuel's  girlfriend Yvonne tells him she's pregnant and wants three hundred dollars  for an abortion. It ends up being a lie, she just wants Manuel's money.  Either way it is still a topic that should not be exposed to young readers  in a book,but if possible by their own parents.  The book is basically  about two young boys no older than sixteen who are both leaders in rival  gangs. These two boys, Manuel Castillo and Ernie Sierra, compete against  each other to see who is braver.Manuel's way of showing bravery is by  jumping infront of a gate when the bull charges out of the tunnel.Luckily  he does not get killed but risks his life just so people can see how  "brave" he is. Ernie Sierra is a drug dealer who exports drugs  from USA to Mexico using pigeons, like the ones used to send messages. Ben  Delaney is Manuel's parole officer, who is also the narrator of the  story.Throughout the story Delaney tries to keep Manuel out of trouble. I  guess the best human concern developed  by the author is courage. Not in  the part of the two boys because killing people and selling drugs isn't  being courages,but by the parole officer Delaney. Sometimes he had to face  danger just to try to keep the two gangs from fighting.For example when he  goes to Ernie's house to prevent Manuel from killing Ernie, he is risking  his life by being caught in the middle and getting shot. Delaney is afraid  of getting shot by Ernie, but he still tries to stop him from harming  others.  Throughout the story these two boys both commit acts that are  unappropriate for children their age. Like I stated before Ernie sells  drugs and also harms anyone that gets in his way. Manuel ends up in jail  for causing a mutiny on a ship he was working on, and ends up escaping from  jail. At the end of the story Manuel Castillo ends up getting killed by a  grape picking machine. Not by accident but by displaying what he thought  was courage or bravery. He jumped in front of the machine, (just like he  did before with the bull) and did not move when it came towards him. The  machine ended up squishing him just like if he were a grape.This story  shows young readers the wrong idea of being courages, and is therefore not  a book I recommend to young readers 
 This was the worst kind of science fiction.  Romance was the driving factor of the story, instead of an aspect of a bigger whole.  The reasons stated for the character's actions seldom seemed believable, and the science was non-existent.    
 I've owned two pairs of these for over 4 years and used them in different environments (multi-floor house, single-floor apartment) and have to concur with others that it is nearly impossible to get a clean signal.  Static, popping, cordless phone conversations from other houses / apartments, etc. is the norm.  I've also tried tuning across the variable spectrum with the same failed results.  They work, for my purposes, but I can't honestly recommend these to anyone 
 I believe you can find a better auditing textbook in the market. I took an auditing class with one of the authur in Portland and, as a result, was required to buy the textbook. But, I ended up using another auditing textbook in order to get an "A" from this class. The format and writing style are very difficult to follow and understand 
 This book has a lot of useful info, probably more than 1st Aid, and the outline format organization is great to follow. So I think its best to either go with this book or 1st Aid. I recommend 1st Aid. It worked for me 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 I, too, lost my father at an early age.  I was seeking a book to help as I struggled with his death many years later.   I rate this book a "2" because it didn't seem to provide the insight or informal counseling that i would have expected in a book, but rather was just a story with several examples of how other folks wrestled with the loss.  I couldn't finish the book and have moved on to other books as I wrestle with these issues 
 The characters in this book are forever taking showers.  When they're not taking showers, they are either planning to take a shower, wishing they could take a shower, or telling each other to take a shower.    Why in the world does she make the main character, Kate, a scant *29* years old??  It's ridiculous.  Not only does she have an MD, she has at least one PhD.  And she has managed to reach the top of her field by 29.  But wait, there's more!  She also, during all this achievement, managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of TWENTY, and then raise it.  Uh huh.  Why does Johansen not just make Kate 39, and be a bit more realistic on all counts?  There is a hint early on when Kate muses that Benny, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, is only 23, which makes her so much more attractive than elderly Kate.  ARGH! Clearly, Johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of 39.  *snore*  How ridiculous 
 I read Bonfire, Man In Full, Right Stuff, and Hooking Up, and then tried this one. I could not stand it! Amazing some of these reviews. If you read one of the above and want to try another, stick to that list. Electric Kook-Aide is difficult to read if you like a story that flows and becomes a page turner 
 Embraced By The Light by Betty J. Eadie is actually a pretty good book, well written, and probably well-researched from other people's NDE's.  This book is filled with some great stuff, but also some not so great stuff.  Eventually, no matter how open your mind is, it becomes clearer and clearer that some of these things are either made up or a rip-off from other NDE accounts.  The author seems sincere and it is a heartfelt account.  I could actually feel myself in her shoes in each page of the book, and empathize with her.  The book is heart-wrenching at times and I actually sobbed.  Not so much in sorrow, but a sadness mixed with joy.  The book is very bittersweet but filled with hope, and it provides an invaluable message...  That the most important thing in life is to enjoy life and to love each other.  Now what I just wrote would make the book worth 5 stars.  However, this is where the scale tips backwards.  The book is biased.  She goes on to say that while she was in "heaven" in her NDE, she realized that the creator of the Universe and all else is Jesus Christ himself.  Of course the description of Jesus is the typical white man with a beard with a light glowing from within his beard.  That's all fine and good.  BUT, Mrs. Eadie forgets to say that the creator of the Universe presented itself to HER as Jesus Christ.  This is not a Universal Truth, it is the author's truth.   Eadie makes a good point that while in "heaven," she learned that it is foolish to criticize other people's religious beliefs, or lack of...  Then she ruins this promising statement by indicating that Christianity is at the top rung and that all other religions don't hold the same love and promises as the gospel.  To a Christian or Mormon, this would make sense, but the TRUTH is that all religions or lack of them are EQUAL.  Christianity is no better than Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Wicca, Paganism, Tao, or any others.  To think that one is better, more true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance.  The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was "Eve's impatience" or whatever in the "garden of eden" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.   Men and women are EQUAL, period.  This book also slams the concept of reincarnation.  Reincarnation can't quite be scientifically proven, but it is on the brink.  Shame on you Mrs. Eadie.  But if that's her perspective and what she thought she learned in "heaven," than she is entitled to her "conclusion."  Remember folks...  There can be as many similarities in many individual's Near-Death Experiences as there are differences.  Something that is important to know is that Jesus or Jehovah or Angels are not any more true, real, living, or righteous than Pan, Dionysus, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Demeter, Diana, Hecate, Buddha, Shiva, Krishna, etc, for representations of the Creator.  People need to decide for themselves which form of God or Goddess (YES, GOD COULD BE FEMALE, it's not impossible, no matter what the bible, the kuran, or the book or mormon says) to believe in and/or worship.  Overall, this is a decent book, despite its faults and biases.  To a Christian, Mormon, and/or a New Ager, who is dealing with death and dying, or has someone close to you who is, I highly recommend this book to you.  Even to non-Christians, this isn't an entirely bad read, but there are much better accounts for non-Christians and all are just as valid as Mrs. Eadie's.  Remember, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it and to love one another.  
 I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a horror flick.  From the description, it doesn't sound too bad.  It sounds pretty exciting.  The real thing?  Kind of a disaster.  From the very beginning featuring a rape scene, I began thinking to myself, what am I watching?  It definitely didn't get any better from there.  It managed to be somewhat entertaining, but at the expense of unnecessary nudity and fake violence.  The only reason I kept watching was to see the ending.  They tried to salvage it with this big revelation, that really didn't make much sense at all either way.  If interested in this movie, just keep in mind - it's not horror.  I don't even know what it is, and I'm still asking myself what I just saw 
 I bought this unit to replace a Black & Decker Brew & Go and my old drip coffeemaker.  I was disappointed because the brewed coffee was not as hot as it should have been and it was also weak.  It also took forever to brew -- 12.5 minutes for a pot!  So, if you're looking for a fast cup of coffee that tastes great, try another coffeemaker.  My little Brew & Go makes better cup of coffee and it only costs $15-20!  
 This is going to be short, but sweet. This book was by far one of the most bothersome collections of short stories I have had the misfortune to come across. With authors such as Robert Lipsyte, Diane Duane, and Richard Peck, this is hardly what I would call a "selection of great work from great writers." For that matter, It isn't a collection of anything but chronologically trapped short stories featuring such characters as "Craig the Cat" the rock-star who dressed like a cat and held a bottle of spilling milk while posing atop a garbage can for magazine shoots. The biggest problem with this book is that the stories are oriented for pre-teens but to find any value or worthwhile messages in the book, you would have to be at least sixteen. Oh the sweet irony. As a young teenager, I feel that this book was a complete was of time. G'day 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 As a person who researches war memoirs, I have to say that this particular book doesn't ring true.  The author seems to have had far more experiences that most veterans who write memoirs. From what I have gleaned, war consists of long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of abject terror.  The author goes from one incident to another, many of which don't seem quite right.  The incident of shooting the two German prisoners seems to me like a story the author heard and he simply injected himself into it.  The  triumph he feels because he shoots both prisoners with one bullet seems overdrawn to me though I suspect that this was a rumor that made the rounds of forces in Europe. Rumors and tall tales were rife then, as other memoirs make clear.  However, if you are looking for a good yarn, this is full of incident though the trained scholar will probably note some problems with verisimilitude. 
 This is by far the worst movie on the planet earth. The entire film is based on the life of some clown Schmidt, who is starting to get really depressed because his days drag and suck probably due to the fact that he is getting older.....don't we as viewers get it? His life sucks...your watching a film about his life...it sucks. I will say the film's director accurately portrays the boredom and complete lack of entertainment Jack Nicholson's character was experiencing but that in turn means the film bites. I don't know who the fossils where who said this movie was good but I can tell you these are not the people to call for a fast paced Friday Night, or even a slow paced Sunday evening 
 This is by far my favorite Michael Bolton album.  It blows 
 A lot of reviews focus on the main character Thomas Covenant.  From the reviews I read some people love Covenant, some hate him and others love to hate him.  I thought he was a bad character but for a different reason. Personally I don't find him fleshed out enough to be believable so I didn't really pay attention to what he's feeling and doing during the story and I realized that I wasn't missing anything!  For two books in a row now he's been this unwilling character that  gets dragged through the plot and doesn't actually have an effect.  Ok so in the first book he rapes a girl at the beginning and at the end his magic ring does something but in this one he literally does not do a single thing!  As in the first book he takes up a lot of description because he's constantly angry, sad, guilty, etc. and we have to hear about it all the time but now he doesn't even have an effect on the story.  The characters would have done the same thing without him there and it's for that reason I think he's a bad character.  Aside from Covenant there are several other characters but since they're not the main character they're even more shallow than Covenant.  They just don't have real personalities.  The author makes all of his characters go so quickly from being incredibly scared or sad to mastering their emotions and taking charge.  It's just not realistic.  Sure, it's fantasy, but that doesn't give an author license to create characters that are all mentally incomprehensible!  A friend of mine loves this series and for him I went ahead and read the second book but I almost didn't make it through and the reason for this can be summed up in two words: As If.  The 'as if' construction is Donaldson's favorite.  I'm not exagerating when I say he uses it 2-3 times per page.  Not only is it annoying to constantly read this but a majority are needlessly added.  For example, instead of saying that the smooth, reflective water "looked burnished", he says that it's "as if the water were burnished".  The sentence on its own perhaps isn't so horrible; it's a little wordy and it adds an oddly hypothetical connotation to the description, but when this type of thing happens once every three paragraphs it becomes fairly annoying over the journey of 500 pages.  At other times the 'as if' constructions just don't make sense.  At one point the main character has fallen and is, "lying prostrate on the floor beside the coffee table as if he had fallen off a catafalque."  What is a catafalque, you ask?  Another quirk of Donaldson's is to get out the dictionary and thesaurus to use unnecessarily obscure vocabulary.  I don't know if he's trying to impress his readers but to me it read like when a child uses the Thesauras to vary their vocabulary and they end up misusing words.  According to Merriam-Webster a catafalque is, "an ornamental structure sometimes used in funerals for the lying in state of the body."  How does a catafalque affect the way someone would fall?  He could have fallen from walking, from lying on the couch, or from a catafalque and still be lying prostrate in the same way on the floor - so why go with some obscure word no one's heard of?  He's lying next to the coffee table; we get the picture.  Move on.    This book could have gotten a 1 but I reserve that for books that I don't finish and somehow I managed to get through this one.  I don't think I'll be attempting the third book in this series 
 the dialog is so unnatural and so contrite. the female leading actor does not look like anything but with a killer figures in white bikini. a stupid scenario tried to mimic 'the blue lagoon' buttered with a bit of brosnan's 'robinson cruso?' junk, mixed some more of 'the swiss family of robison (or is it 'swiss robinson family'? well, whatever). the whole movie would never survived if without bill zane. the latin lover actor also acted so badly. the whole movie is just a disaster, skin-deep shallow and unconvincing at all. we had rejected it out of the dvd player twice, then thought to make the rental worth and decided to force ourselves to finish it. well, still cheaper than going to the Caribbeans in person, can't afford it even in my next life 
 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 This keyboard stand is rather shaky and does not fit into the slots of the keyboard.  I am constantly worrying that it will be knocked over with  any type of vigorous use.  I have placed it against the wall, and that is it's only saving grace 
   Tens of thousands of books are published every year: few of them sell more than a couple of thousand copies at best. Sometimes you come across a book from a "name" publisher and wonder why the manuscript wasn't tossed into the wastbasket. This is one of those books.    This book is filled with New Age nostrums. "Let's visit the cosmic sphere tht contains our neighborhood - the center of our visible universe." (By the way, Leo Tolstoi visited this neighborhood in the 19th Century in his "The Kingdom of God is Within You.") More great advice from Primack and Abrams, the husband-wife team that claims great new cosmological insights: "Movement becomes a mere idea. There is no visible way to detect it, only the tricky conciousness of time passing." Here's another gem: "The Cosmic Las Vegas metaphor illustrates trhe random, quantum nature of eternal inflation, but it gives no sense of what the theory of eternal inflation could mean if it is true." Yeah. Sure.    Reciting every mawkish statement in this pretentious tome would take as much space as the book itself. As a final example, how about "We represent  an age on Earth comparable to the age of cosmic inflation at the beginning of the universe: brief, but about to set the pattern for the long-term future. . . . For our entire species, today matters."    This New Age gruel is served up as a plea for scientific thinking. It is anything but. It is a feel-good tract on how special you are, much like the character in the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.    Greater good could have been done by saving the trees sacrificed for the paper the nonsensical nostrums of Priamck and Abrams are printed on.  Jerr 
 I thought this Biography very interesting but I have to say I will NEVER read it again, The horrible beatings he had to endure as a nine year old boy left me sickened and depressed,I made myself finish it, so I could write this review. The cruelty displayed by the Matron and Headmaster was terrible, especially since these boys were away from home with no one to talk to. If you enjoy reading about such things than this is the book for you.  What is truly amazing is Dahl's humor in writing these memories, I guess he had to go through this so he could write his books,,,,,sa 
 It may seem incredible, but this book actually gave me the encouragement needed to experiment with the drug.  Heck, I didn't know you can sniff it.  And, according to the author, it's not very dangerous. Quitting entails little more than the equivalent of a really bad case of the flu.    I tried it.  It's not as she describes. Not at all.  It's been a while since I read it, and I must admit, I remember very little about it.  Which speaks more to its content than to my memory. Very little humanity, heart, all the good stuff we're looking for in books, art, and life.  I actually do feel sorry for the author.  In any event, readers she be aware that her portrayal of heroine use is quite inaccurate and misleading.  I speak from experience 
 I have to admit, I didn't actually cook anything out of this book, so I can't comment on how anything tastes. I was so dissapointed in that the recipes didn't include any nutritional information other than the 'balanced portion' block information. Also, most of these recipes are for 1 serving! Some of the dinners were calculated for 4 servings, but they were in the minority! I'm just not interested in multiplying the recipes out every time I need to make a grocery list or prepare a meal to figure out what I need. I was looking for a way to prepare zone meals using food readily available in grocery stores (had to look up what steel-cut oats were), and not by adding zone perfect protein powder to everything. I normally use cookbooks by Oxmoor House (Southern Living, Cooking Light), and for now I'll continue to do so. This one's getting returned 
 The book was a little more challenging than I thought it would be. I wanted basic steps and lot's of pictures. It really didn't have either one. It was a little outdated 
 The Contortionist's Handbook, Craig Clevenger's first novel, is a weird, complicated, seemingly pointless exercise in futility.  The novel follows John Dolan, who is known by many other names throughout the book, because that is what he does, he changes his identity, and others, with great expertise and perfection.  We are introduced to John when he wakes up from a headache that he refers to as a "godsplitter" in a hospital, and he is forced to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is suicidal or depressed.  From that point, the novel divides its time between the interview between John and the Evaluator and giving us John's life story, which is remarkably uninteresting for such a weird tale.  The thing that gets me about this book is that it seemingly has no point.  I guess one could say its point to be "anti-psychiatry," but forgive me for asking that the author also include somewhat of a plot to at least make the story interesting.  The only interesting and entertaining part of the novel is the interaction between John and the Evaluator.  But, for some reason, Clevenger decides that John's life story is more important, even though we are only given a brief, fleeting glimpse into a life that seems to be much more complicated than the author wanted to put into the novel.  Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining about the novel's length, because I don't think I would have finished it if it was longer than it already is.    I also read Clevenger's second novel, Dermaphoria, a while ago, and while I didn't really enjoy it, the novel at least had some semblance of a story that made it worth reading.  As this novel grew closer and closer to ending, I slowly realized that there was no way that any meaning was going to be given to the convoluted story within the last 20 pages.  Clevenger tries to inject some suspense into the story near the end, but he ends up just using underdeveloped characters to do things that we have no idea what their motivation is for doing.  I think that Clevenger could be a good writer, but, dear Lord, he needs to try writing a "normal" novel, until I read about one of his novels, and it isn't about a drugged out freak or a mentally unstable counterfeiter, I think that I am pretty much done giving his novels the benefit of the doubt 
 I'm about half way through this book and I'm finding it a little boring. I've read so many books about Diana, that I find myself skimming over the stuff that's been written SO MANY times. As a result, I'm probably missing any new stuff that might actually be in here. It's also very hard to find a reading flow--it seems more like an academic text or report, not a biography. Good try at compiling old news into a new book, but I'd recommend waiting for the discount rack or skipping altogether. 
 My baby got this for Christmas.  He was about 7 months old.  Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it.  My 3-year old doesn't play with it either and he loves most of our other "baby" toys.  This toy is just not that interesting.  I wish my mother-in-law would have saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful at all 
 We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses.  Even though we purchased it as a "play" bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child.  We immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be.   It's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably wouldn't last long anyway.  I recommend you look else where for your child's princess dreams 
 Recordings sound like they were all done the same day, in as little time as possible, with the least amount of studio talent.  Terrible 
 I just didn't like this book.  I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET.  Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them.  The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.  Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanity  Con- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.  It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it 
 who is this girl? this is not the same tomboy/dorky Gwen i know in a band called No Doubt. her image has totally changed and i dont like it. she cares too much of what people think of her now. with no doubt all their songs were deep in meaning and actually meant something! this **** is bananas. i could have wrote that!! no offense to gwen or anything, i luv her 2 death and im the hugest fan of no doubt but i cant accept her new pop sound. it just blends in with all the other artists 
 he just needs to retire. screw this non-gangsta. no real G sings, they just rap, GOD 
 The Sennheiser PMX70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others I'd used recently. I had high hopes on first listen. However, these semi-in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes. I later took them on a 40 minute run. The design is such that in any position I adjusted them, the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear. Once I started perspiring, my sweat poured right into the little speakers. I had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces. The right speaker was filled with sweat and non-functional pretty much the entire run. Who designed these? Consider these headphones only if you 1) never plan to exercise while using them and 2) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less

 I look for two things from a self-help book or tape.  First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life.  Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes.  This tape fails in both respects.  While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation.  And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.  There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed 
 I am an animal lover and owner of three dogs. I also practice alternative medecine and my dogs are in my office with me. I received this book for my birthday and do not know what to say to the woman who gave it to me.   I found it boring, repetitive and full of "aren't I wonderful" stories about the poor author struggling through vet school, tortuing animals and gee whiz not liking it, then, golly, figuring he was going to darn well do something about it.  OK, he went to acupuncture school before a lot of others, but he is so pro acupuncture I find it tedious.  He mentions other alternative therapies only briefly, and I could tell he was not well versed in them.  He goes on and on ad infinitum about how other methods "work well in conjuntion with regular veterinary care".  Well, isn't that rocket science?  A poorly written, egocentric story about a vet and his "magic dog".  Give me a break 
 ryan and scott from 'desert sons' continue their adventures.  their desert home suddenly seems to be bursting from the seams with homosexuals, each of whom seem to have some wicked agenda.  the boys must deal with all of this while also dealing with stresses on their relationship. i, like another reviewer, made the mistake of buying both 'desert sons' and this book at the same time.  this is a very sloppy work.  the characters are, or become, incredibly two-dimensional.  all the boys seem to only have 'sex' as a hobby.  the reactions of most characters to plot points is either forced or ridiculous.  the time of the story, never really established, is suddenly set as 1990/91 - in quite a jarring fashion, seeing the assumption is that it is occuring in the modern day.  again, the editing is poor to non-existent.  see if you can get by the three or four lines containg about twenty "huffs" without doing a doubletake.  every character seems to have a veritable horn of plenty attached to their bank account.  the finale, as it is, does nothing but wraps everything up like a neat little package.   very disappointing sequel to a very disappointing book 
 Lucky for us, Siri Hustvedt went on to write greater things, and we can expect even more of her as she hones her craft.  "The Enchantment of Lily Dahl," he second novel, will disappoint those readers who absolutlely loved her novel "What I Loved," an emotionally gripping, sophisticatedly plotted and lyrical novel about the intersections of love, art and life in 1980s and 1990s New York City.  I found nothing really enchanting or enchanted about Hustvedt's protaganist in this one, a blond buxom waitress withering as in smalltown Minnesota but hoping for a career as an actress.  The story might have been about a young woman discovering something within herself and her surroundings, but instead, the reader gets a murder mystery with a psycho, as well as a handful of caricatured and unbelievable characters who all seem to love Lily Dahl but never seem to get her.  Don't judge Hustvedt by this one 
 DeMille has done a rotten job with this book.  Aspects of the plot(which isn't too bad) are never resolved.  If you must read this badly written book, wait until it goes on sale. 
 I love Gregory Maguire's work, but I have to exclude this book. I agree with almost every negative remark made in the reviews I've read. I'm the kind of person that tries to finsh a book once I've started it, and this horrid story just went on forever in confusion. I didn't know what was going on until the last chapter of the book! My advice to anyone going to read the book - start with the last chapter - I'm sure you'll still be confused, but maybe you'll enjoy reading the book more! Sorry Gregory! Stick with Oz! We need another sequal to Wicked 
 I was looking for some christian books that will help me understand the bible better and found this one from the library. Just a glance of this book got me on the alert side. Although the title of the book bears the name of Jesus, it is largely based on the author's personal meditations than the bible. The author refers very little to the bible. And, the chapter "Rise Above Karma" annoys me as it relates "Karma" to the bible teachings. Is not "Karma" a term for Hinduism and Buddhism? What is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of God and Jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books. The bible tells us to beware of teachings like this 
 I would have to agree with some of the other reviews.  The original series is worth reading, but do yourself a favor and skip the Enthroned.  The quality of the writing declined between the first and second series, and I am guessing that her publisher was disappointed in sales for enthroned and told her to wrap it up when she was half way through book three, leaving the ending rushed, disappointing and unbelievable 
 Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.  I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.  I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 I have read that the person who wrote this story compared her story with that of Harry Potter. Not so! There's not even a mention of anything remotely like Harry and, in my opinion, not worthy of the comparison. But, that's just me and my opinion...you should read it and judge for yourself 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 This is by far the most worthless book I've ever read. It's difficult to call O'Reilly conservative or liberal, since he expresses very little opinion on anything. All he knows how to do is complain and place the blame for America's problems on all kinds of undeserving scapegoats. If you are an O'Reilly fan, God forbid, this book will surely convert you.  My advice? Keep writing, Bill, and I'll certainly have an endless supply of doorstops 
 Once again Wiesel completes another masterly, tear-jerking hoax. How much longer can this phoney get away with it 
 I wanted to like this book, but just can't.  The author is condescending at best and downright insulting at worst.  I think it's safe to assume that anyone buying a cookbook can um - cook! She also uses butter in every other recipe, but according to the book her kids are allergic to dairy.  I don't get it.  She's also a little off the deep end, she basically goes off on the entire food industry as if they are trying to kill her little darlings on purpose.  Then there is a section where she goes off on a tangent about the dangers of using a grill - then she actually has the audacity to provide a recipe for grilling hotdogs and hamburgers!  As if I need a cookbook for that.  The other problem that I have with the book is that nearly every recipe centers around a sauce made with dijon mustard, olive oil and copious amounts of lemon juice.  I'm very allergic to lemon juice, so in all honesty my ability to use this cookbook is almost non-existant.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 i loved all of the previous books by Alexander McCall Smith and looked forward to each new one, although the frequency of publications does make one question if his writing has turned into a pure money producing scheme. However this novel failed to develop Isabel in the manner that I have always viewed her character and has became superficial. To end as this does seems extrordinarily superficial to meet a mass market view of society, and reminds me of the second movie in the 'Back to the Future.' This novel destroyed Isabel for me. mar 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 I would have.  I have never read Danielle Steel, and once I went to pick up a book of hers and saw that it was priced above the normal amount for a paperback.  I put it down, assuming she must be really good, but as I hadn't read anything by her, I wasn't willing to pay extra to do so.  Well, I got Safe Harbor from my local library on audiobook and figured I'd give her a try.    As I listened to this novel, I got very tired of the amateur lack of descriptiveness, and of the redundancy.  I noticed that a few things were said over and over again throughout the novel, like the fact that she had so much to do before the tragedy, and now... afterward she had too much free time, and even though things were hard before, she'd rather have the "business" of a mentally ill son and a husband that didn't care about her.  As if the readers wouldn't remember, or as if we didn't get her point the first 3 times. Many things were repeated like that, and I felt like I was listening to a fifth grade creative writing assignment where the student had to meet a word requirement and didn't have enough content.     Ophelie is weak, simple, and boring, as is Matt.  They have no personality.  The version I am listening to is the unabridged verson, so I can't possibly be just missing something.  I understand that this is supposedly a novel of triumph and the will to survive, but she didn't even care for her child, and it had been a year.  Perhaps these things do happen in real life, but I'd much rather read about women with some semblance of a spine. It should have been one or the other, Ophelie's husband should have been worth mourning so thoroughly.   I assumed this must have been one of her very first novels for it to be so blah, but I checked the publication date... and I'm in shock.    Perhaps Danielle Steel feels she is above having to deliver a quality novel with her fame, I can't begin to understand how such a reknown author could release something so terrible. 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 If your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of "End of the Century" or "Filth and the Fury" THIS AIN'T IT!  Picture taking 40 hours of bad home video (really awful sound) and editing together and calling it a documentary. No current interviews, No voice over making any sense of the chaos...No thought to flow or storyline, just a mishmash of stuff banged together. A real dissapointment. The saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it, this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance. I've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due. Its a shame this is what its been reduced to. Shame on everyone involved 
 I have news for Deedra, it is just as humiliating, infuriating, and degrading for a father as it is for a mother. If women spent more time meeting the short and long term needs of their children they wouldn't be so wounded. Mother's start out on top with the legal system and usually end up on top. Deedra and the other women are heard by the legal system even when they whisper. It doesn't need to be a fight if everyone is concentrating on our children. Children need a mother and a father even if those people live in different homes. 
 Ok, the title of this thing is Flying without wings. Ruben couldn't fly if he had wings because he weighs too dang much. His wings would literally have to stretch over city blocks to get him off the ground. The song is awesome though, Go Ruben! 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 Totally disappointed in the quality of these recordings. It says "remastered". Maybe so, but not in a good way. Sound level varies from song to song, but always low. Staticky with lots of noise. Difficult to hear vocals. I should have known better than to buy an $18.99 album with so few songs, that is not available for preview. 
 I had to buy this book for an Intro to Web Design class and many of my classmates and I agreed that this is not an easy book to follow. It dives into details without laying out the most basics first. In general, the lack of structure and more complicated than necessary language was confusing and maybe one with previous CSS knowledge would know what he's talking about but for a beginner it was quite unhelpful 
 Norman Finkelstein conclusively demonstrates that Dershowitz is a plagiarizer and that his claims about Israel's "superb" human rights record are complete bunk. All reputable human rights organizations support Finkelstein's arguments and not Dershowitz's. Dershowitz's book merits a minus 10, but the lowest grade one can give it is one star. The fact that one can find copies of this book for sale for 1 cent indicate its scholarly and moral usefulness. Dershowitz is now involved in a concerted campaign to have Finkelstein shut down, pressuring Harvard Bookstore and the Barnes and Noble bookstore at DePaul University in Chicago to cancel speaking engagements by Finkelstein. Harvard cancelled its invitation for fear of "economic retaliation," Barnes and Noble said the book was "too controversial," and invited Dershowitz to speak about his "book" instead. 
 We just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by Safety 1st and Parents.  This cover lasted about one minute.  Seriously!  By the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors, my son had opened the first one my husband had installed.  The tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open. 
 I was so excited when I signed this book out from the local library. I read through it with such enthusiasm and excitement and couldn't wait to start applying some of the Ayurvedic principles to my already whole foods diet. Well, my enthusiasm started to fade, then flicker when I started preparing her recipes. The recipes looked good on paper, but the finished product was bland in flavor and lacking in depth. Her overzealous approach of ghee, sugar, white flour and salt floored me. I will not even begin to list the host of medical problems that may ensue if this book was cooked from on a regular basis. Does a cookie recipe really need 2 cups of sugar? Must all of her bread and cookie recipes use white flour? Why not use more whole and natural foods - brown rice syrup for sweetener, spelt flour for the white flour, etc. I tried so hard to make this book work for me (I have tried over thirty recipes), but to no avail. Thankfully, I am not letting this book undermine my new found passion in Ayurveda. I will be looking elsewhere for inspiration for an Ayurvedic diet 
 F.X Toole exemplifies a point that I often attempt to share with friends that are sports fans..... boxing literature is of the only sport that continually thrusts characters raw, frightening yet lovable at us at every level.  Baseball lore and lyric is always an interesting personal deversion, particulairly on a cold winter's night.  But I follow and enjoy Baseball as a sport.  Boxing, as seen on TV on the other hand, is an undertaking which has taken a barbaric back- seat....too ruthless, savage and lacking star power.  However, when written about well and with an insiders' viewpoint, Boxing jumps off the page and into my heart.  Ponud For Pound carries a great deal of pathos, and some really cool jargon....makes me feel like I had a stogie and a fedora and a rolled up program in my hand.  Enjoy this book...I did 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 As an instructor I felt the book was very good, but the students could not use the software on excel 97 or above. It was really frustrating, and I will not use it next semester 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 The first few chapters were a breeze, then WHAMO! into no-mans land. Like the reviewer before me wrote, it suddenly gets way too complicated and decides this is a good time to leave out any descriptions of code 
 Do not buy this unit.  I have tested the VoSky, IOGEAR and now US Robotics and they are ALL junk.  While the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate.  I do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit.  And why are the SO SMALL!?  The are so small as to be practically useless.  The IOGEAR unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons.  Bottom line: Wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a Polycom and the Computer Calling Kit that is available through Polycom.  (Even the Polycom Computer Calling Kit is analog!  What is the problem!? 
 Too hard to follow the instructions . I bought it for my mom who said she could not tell the difference. I am not sure she followed the instructions.I am just assuming  (she is an English Professor )it didnt work too well. 
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 I was very disappointed in Blaise's book about Sandford Fleming and the Creation of Standard time. The book goes into some background about Fleming, which I found very interesting. The point incident that leads Fleming into developing and advocating a Standard Time is also very good. Unfortunately, Blaise loses me by changing the topic to the impact that the railroads had on the Victorian lifestyle, and his pages regarding Sherlock Holmes. I was hoping for more insight into the Prime Meridian conferences, but it didin't happen. I thought Hochschild's 'King Leopold's Ghost' a much better historical book 
 This book is not by Kathy Reichs.  It is by Max Collins, but features Tempe Brennan.  I love Tempe Brennan - Kathy Reichs' forensic anthropologist.  Why she let this author use her character's name and some other characteristics is beyond me.  Here, the character and the story is flat, one-dimensional, linear and written poorly.  It's like a cheap knock-off that is obvious to all once you buy the book and begin reading.  What a disappointment.  
 reviewer PTR said it right, but i'll say it myself: this great, ingenious novel, when we cut to the chase, really s*cks, is really beyond brutal. the writing isn't bad, it's frightening, reaching new heights of convolution and impermeability. i've read Faulkner and liked some of his books. "Light in August" was powerful and hypnotic, and I did the obligatory The Sound..., As I Lay, and another of his earlier novels, the title of which, for the moment, I'm forgetting (but I swear I read it).  Absalom Absalom, assuming you're not a Faulkner cultist, will drive you to near suicide, so keep away any nearby guns. In other words, you may be tempted to take yourself out of your misery, forgetting you've got the freedom to put the book down (i finished it, aware that it was taking months, if not years, off my life). Go ahead, Faulkner fans, rip me a new one.  I can take it 
 Thankfully this book is not very long, so my disappointed is only so deep. It must be said that if Samuel Huntington did not write his "Clash of Civilizations", then this book would not have written or published. This is an attempt to argue Huntington's theory, which is fine, but in the wrong method. Entitled "Identity and Violence", Sen covers very little on Identity and even less on violence. Sen states that we all have multiple IDs. He then restates it. And then again. And then again with the added ideal that focusing on one ID is dangerous. He repeats this too many times.  What Sen fails to address, recognize or grasp is the concept of an Identity. What is it? Why do we have them? What influences IDs? What are the connections between ID and violence. What is violence? Why is it used? Why is it bad? Is violence bad? Just way too many questions about Identity and Violence are left unanswered, unaddressed, and avoided in a book called "Identity and Violence" 
 If you are looking for an unabashed cheerleader on the American Way, this book is for you. If you are already convinced that America is the pinnacle of Western Civilization, nothing in this book will change your mind. If you voted for George W Bush - you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you believe America has made some mistakes and are looking for arguments to convince you that what you thought were mistakes were actually smart decisions - look elsewhere.   Revel is a lover of capitalism, liberalism, obviously an admirer of the USA and probably of George W Bush as well. He makes his disdain for many European positions, as well as those of the American left, quite clear. This is a book written for people who agree with American foreign policy. Revel is well informed on many American foreign policy positions as well as European arguments against those positions. On the rare occasions when he is not insulting Europeans who disagree with him, he provides intelligent and thoughtful views on foreign affairs.   The author spends most of the book distorting European views and insulting those who hold them. A fine example is his description of the US Missile Defense system. He claims that there are 2 arguments against it. One, that it doesn't work and the second that it will work too well and make useless the arsenals of the other nuclear powers. These are obviously contradictory arguments and he claims to be baffled that anyone could believe them both. Oddly enough, I've never heard from anyone who believed them both. I do recall the letter signed by 50 Nobel prize winning scientists claiming that the project is a waste of money. I also recall hearing from those worried about angering Russia and China.   Mr Revel's penchant for ridiculing those who disagree with him is occasionally amusing but never convincing. It's a shame. I think he's right on a number of points. If he would just turn his copious knowledge of foreign policy and his broad vocabulary toward convincing people instead of insulting them - he might actually have an impact on someone who doesn't agree with him already. 
 The cover is too floppy and the pages too thin.  This makes it difficult to flip between pages.  Also, in the middle of the book, the pages were cut incorrectly (they are folded over).  I would not buy this again and as a matter of fact, will need to buy another version to replace this 
 I couldn't get through this book. I managed to read through the first 5 chapters before getting really irritated at all of the grammatical and spelling errors. It is as if the author did not have anyone edit her work before submitting it to be published. And since it was published by IUniverse, I shouldn't have been that surprised. Also, I was constantly detracted by the overuse and inappropriate use of adjectives, metaphors and cliched phrases. The one thing this book had going for it was the plot. The prologue was the only thing that I would consider decently written in the entire novel. There are glaring disrepencies throughout the novel that absolutly could not be ignored. The characters switch back and forth so much you cannot get a grasp as to who they really are. Because of this they seem supremely superficial. This book came across as being very quickly written as there are so many jumps from scene to scene and very obvious contradictions that it was really difficult for me to get as far as I did. Do not waste your money on this book. The plot isn't good enough to make up for the terrible writing 
 A well written book but let's not forget what these people where in prison for. They where in prison for having murdered or helped to murder other people agree or disagree with what they stood for the rule of law has to be upheld no matter what. These people had a choice and they made the wrong one they where not hero's only fools to themselves and there so called cause 
 Actually Ottmar Liebert is one of my favorite artists, but the concept of rereleasing an old CD with 6 extra tracks and one of the tracks on the original omitted is responsible for the 2 star rating. It would have been one star except that I have respect for Ottmar Liebert as an artist. Actually I don't find the special edition quite as moving as the original despite the extra tracks. Partly it is because the new CD starts off with "Surrender to Love" instead of the more catchy "Barcelona Nights". Anyone with a sense of music appreciation knows that you start off with a fast piece and put the slower more melancholy pieces in the middle, not the other way around. One of the extra tracks, "La Memoria/Shadows" is just a rerelease of one of the omitted tracks on the original "Shadows" with a different introduction. A good artist is ruined by releases like this 
 I would have rated "0 stars " if poosible in the selection. Since this is the textbook for my course I have to deal with this book. The way things are mentioned in this book I doubt whether the authors have even understood the concepts right. I think that the authors themselves are confused while writing this book. If this book is for your course, drop the course before it is too late 
 When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.    If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best 
 While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail.  I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece.  Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a "springboard" for further research 
 As a neophyte to Feng Shui, this book appealed to me because it contained many examples of how to apply Feng Shui to everyday situations.  Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly organized - extracting  information that could be useful in my everyday life wasn't intuitive.   Feng Shui is an ancient and complex art - and it seems the only message  that I got out of this book is I need to pay a consultant to apply Feng  Shui to my environment 
 I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  Any perceived reduction in pain can be caused by the placebo affect.  I highly doubt that someone who had bowed legs, all of a sudden had straight legs in five minutes.  The author is vague and the chapters lack documentation (Once, there was this lady who came to me...).  The author claims to be able to change the molecular structure of water by "running energy" into it.  Sorry, I might be closed minded, but there is no way.  The whole "quantum physics" thing is just a scientific explanation that, conveniently, no one can disprove, and the author uses this to his advantage to sell books, dvds, training sessions, etc.. 
 I was disappointed with this powder. I thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract, but it doesn't. When used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed. I won't buy it again. I prefer using vanilla extract 
 A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere 
 Heavy machine, looked durable, almost commercial. Put her together and began. Within 5 MINUTES of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated! Returned it the following day and bought a Bissel that has worked great, was cheaper and weighs less! 
 After reading "Excuse me Your Life is Waiting" I ordered the Playbook with high expectations.  While I found the first book to be life transforming, I thought the Playbook was a step backwards.  Too many exercises, too much wallowing in the past.  Where is the excitement and the good feelings of the first book?  I have been trying for about a year to get through this book, but I don't think I ever will.  It just doesn't have the spark of the first book.  I probably would have given this book higher marks before reading the first book, but now it pales in comparison.  If you like to work hard before you get the reward this book might be what you need, but read it before "Excuse Me, Your life is Waiting"

 I am a new dad with a 10-week old daughter.  So I am currently living the period of fatherhood covered by this book.  I was also a military officer, so I am pretty well versed on military jargon, acronyms, and humor.  I found this book to be neither helpful or funny.  It was actually so annoying that I started to skip sections trying to get to the end faster, and then I just decided to stop reading entirely.  From an information stand point, you will learn nothing that you won't get from the dozens of random people giving you unsolicited advice and stories of their own experience.  If you want accurate, detailed, and thorough information, this is not the book for you.  [... 
 Doubtless going to rattle a few cages here, on *both* sides: the people who consider his stuff impermissibly naughty, and the people who wax rhapsodic about this particular work.  But it has to be said.  Britain, the land that pioneered imprisonment without charge before we did, the land that criminalizes self-defense against burglars in your own home, is also the land without a First Amendment; and this has seemingly scared Mr. Hamilton into self-censoring and mutilating his own product.  This is a first-rank tragedy, as he is arguably the best-known and most highly respected photographer of this entire genre, and therefore the most likely to prevail in a frontal assault against the philistinism which equates nude photography with pornography.  Instead, however, he has in this volume essentially raised the white flag and abandoned *nude* photography in favor of topless photos which won't arouse the ire of the British police.  An astonishing number of his photos are awkwardly cropped for legal, rather than aesthetic reasons, so what was clearly shot as an integral figure study gets published as an amputated torso.  This phenomenon was *not* present in his early works, including his films and his photos for the Spanish edition of "Playboy"--it manifested itself only when the world got uniquely psychotic about "child pornography".  Even in the USA, where a 17-year-old Marine who carries a machine gun for a living can be considered a "child" if photographed wrongly, Sally Mann and Jock Sturges haven't thrown in the towel (or draped the model in it ;-).  Nor, of course has Bourboulon or Ionesco.  So I say:  Boycott!  The guy's got a right to protect his hide, of course, and even Galileo recanted when the Inquisition threatened to murder him for saying the Earth goes around the Sun.  But would you spend your money on a book that says it's the other way around? 
 K, besides the late arrival, the whole book was written in terminology in which I had to read over and over again before I understood the meaning. Its not like the book came with appendices right? Anyway, I do not know whats the huu haa about the book. It seems pretty fictional. Coming from a Muslim 
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 Doesn't even come close to working with loose tea...........save your money! In short garbage at any price!!!! 
 The picture is outstanding, but lately it has been crashing on me.  It will just stop at a random point.  Brand new discs even stop and give me an error code; then, I have to go around back and unplug the player just to get the disc out.  Going to return it and hope for the best, but from what I've read, other people are experiencing similar problems.  
 I study Ryuseiken Batto-do and I wanted to study some iaido so I purchased this book. This was the worst book that I have ever seen. The diagrams are awful because you can not see which leg or which arm is which. I am very disappointed and I will never recomend this book. The only good that has come out of this is that now I know I need to read the reviews before I buy book. Then at least I can't  be mad at anyone but myself for buying a boo 
  I waited for quite some time for this book to come out, but I ended up  being a little dissapointed.  I love Loretta Lux, but I know this is not a full compilation of her work and I feel like many of my favorites were left out.  Maybe she's saving them up for "Volume 2" 
 I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.  As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering "well researched".  The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women.  The "supporting facts" in the book are as comical as the cover.  This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias 
 Because this item did not come with a companion book, it does not suit my family's needs.  This is most disappointing.  For the price, it should include a companion book 
 I was hoping to receive a book about relationships to help  with some classes I will teach.  So, this book about astrology was very disappointing 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 This book has lots of nice photographs.  That is all.  The technical section consists of two pages which state that a waterproof membrane is needed between the roof structure and the soil.  There is no information of a technical nature in the book.  I wonder why use up the earth's resources for no value.  An absolute waste 
 No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...           
 This book is so much worse than the Princeton Review it's amazing. The typos are so bad that in the practice tests' answer sheets, the 2nd math section is missing the bubbles for the (e) answer choice! So I had to make my own little bubble while taking the tests.  The tests also seem to be unbalanced. My score on them went way up from the diagnostic and then by the 6th test was back down to almost my original diagnostic score! Very VERY depressing. Until I picked up the princeton book and aced the practice tests in there, I was feeling like I was going to do horribly  The practice tests are also WAY harder than the actual test, although they are a lot of practice, even with the errors, so this is the book's only saving grace.  The explanations are horrible compared to the princeton review's, and the writing section is particularly apalling. It does not even attempt to help you! It has bad advice, and no, i repeat no, coverage of the grammar you'll need to know.   I'm so glad I got the princeton review book just in time to go through before the PSAT, it was so much better.  
 If you ever read this book: Joe Sack' SQL server 2000 Fast Answers for DBA and Developer, then you will see Vieira's book misses so many details about SQL server 2000. Understanding that this book focuses on PROGRAMMING only, but still it misses many PROGRAMMING  DETAILS of SQL server 2000. I do not have no connection to Joe Sack's business. I read and compare the two and speak out my mind. 
 I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover 
 it is varied, with designes for babies, women, etc' but nothing that I realy would like to make. seems boring. I am sorry for buying it 
 Girls trying real hard to be Rock Stars.  Another 70's style production with a S.C. look a like singer with nothing new to say.    
 I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.  Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concerned Again he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.  The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between. Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure Tim  Robbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates. And the end is kind of loose.  Give it a mis 
 One or two of the essays are interesting; the others are either fuzzy attempts at deep thinking ("We need new paradigms! Bartender! New paradigms all 'round!") or spend too much time touting whatever it is the authors have that they want advertised.  Inconsistent (in both level and quality), but with some buried nugget 
 Reading Mr. O'Rourke's "All the Troubles in the World" gave me the impression that he is an excellent political/economics analyst with a tolerable bad streak. The fine writing in that book encouraged me to acquire some of his other work.   I was horribly repulsed by the explicit language, immature humor and overall repugnance of his guide to manners. What I had hoped would be a light poke at contemporary society so sickened me that I threw the book in the trash before I was halfway done. I regret reading even that far 
 My brother picked up this cd used for a few dollars at the local record store because it looked interesting.  Wow, we couldn't keep a straight face throughout this album, it's so amazingly terrible, we just laughed through every song.  I don't want to offend any of our friends overseas, but wow, this guy doesn't even rap!  he just talks with his deep accent over boring beats, I honestly tried to give this album a fair chance, and it hurt my ears.  I mean, have you ever heard something just so awful (like Men Without Hats) that it's funny?  That's the vibe this album gives me.  I have no idea why this guy is successful, maybe there is subliminal messages in the music brainwashing people to like it, but then again, people LOVED the Macarena at one point, so it doesn't surprise me.  Anywho, I'm gonna go ahead and end this review, to the serious hip hop fan, avoid this album like the plague, get a restraining order if you have to.  For people that are charmed and fascinated with English accents and bad music, this cd is right up your alley.  The Zappe 
 I am a fan of Ricky but not this album. I prefer him singing spanish instead of English. The only good part about the album is the salsa sounds. 
 I read this book at the local Barnes & Nobles. I thougt I was getting something out of it because the ideas the author was talking about sounds very interesting.  I was greatly disappointed because throughout the entire book, I found no actual example of dialogues, NONE. It's like saying "BE frindly at first every you meet a person" and it does not tell you how to be friendly nor any example of conversation.  Don't waste your money, I recommend this one instead:  Conversationally Speaking : Tested New Ways to Increase Your Personal and Social Effectiveness by Alan Garner  Thanks for readin 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 So Ms. Bennett wants women to keep working and dole out their children to day care, right?  Well, wait a minute, who are "daycare"?  Are the day care workers and nannies not women themselves?  What about them?  If it is a mistake for women to stay home with their own children, why should a stranger "stay home" with someone else's children??  Why is it okay for working women to take advantage of these low paid women by trapping them in what Ms. Bennett seems to view as depressing and unfulfilling labor?  Is Ms. Bennett simply overlooking this fact, or is she in favor of a two-tiered society, where wealthy working parents have it all, while day care workers remain in low wage jobs and merely scrape by?  Sounds like a rather elitest view of the world to me 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 I bought this for my dad's birthday.  He is a fisherman.  This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Not entertaining, not funny, not interesting, not even a fishing movie.  I bought it based on several reviews I read.  This is the first time I've been led astray on Amazon.  The "5 Stars" rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy 
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 I am not giving the movie 2 stars, in my opinon it is required viewing for anyone interested in kung fu/wuxia cinema. This movie was groundbreaking for its time, and it was a lot of fun to see the many inspirations for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the film.  It was also fun to see Chang Pei Pei (the villian of CTHD) in her early years. She and Angela Mao broke ground for future Hong Kong women warriors such as Michelle Yeoh. Now, as for the DVD itself...HORRIBLE.  It is of such low quality that it wouldn't play on ANY player without skipping at least a little bit.  The transfer looks horrible, it made what I am sure is a beautiful looking film look like I filmed it on a camera phone. And the worst offense, for about 20 minutes in the middle of the film you can't see the subtitles! They just drop off the screen! Well, not ALL of them, you can still read the tops of the letters!!! Somehow this is repaired before the film ends so the movie wasn't totally ruined. The day someone wants releases this movie in a even average quality DVD, BUY IT, WATCH IT, LOVE IT! Till then, I am sorry to say, don't bother with this horrible DVD. 
 Where to begin?  The plot is transparent, the characters can barely be called that, and the writing style alone should have made the book unpublishable.  I am excessively sorry to have spent time and money on this 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 As a movie per se, this one is incredibly stupid even by James Bond standards. But, those of us who have become Toby Stephens fans after Masterpiece Theatre's "Jane Eyre" can fast-forward through to enjoy the parachuting-into-London scene and especially the swordfight scene, which features Toby in a sleeveless tight-fitting outfit that shows off his fantastic body (yum!). Toby's physique looks something like Gene Kelly's (except Toby's arms and shoulders are more muscular), and his swordfighting is action-movie-worthy yet so graceful it almost looks like dancing (which you can see more of on the extra disc, which breaks down the swordfight so you can see how it was filmed -- lots of fun). The movie also includes a few examples of Toby's superb sneer -- and smile. His other mannerisms in the film appear to have been based on Richard Branson, and an excellent impersonation it is. He delivers the wooden, stupid dialog as well as anyone could (it's not his fault the movie is so ridden with idiodic puns and cliches). Really, you have to feel sorry for Pierce -- he looks so old and lame next to the sparkling Toby. Despite those pleasures, not sure if this is worth buying -- I borrowed it from my library 
 It's difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor 16mm print to transfer to DVD when there must be good 35mm prints out there, but this is another case of showcasing a very poor 16mm print. Otherwise, this is an excellent madcap film, but it doesn't start cooking until the Edgar Kennedy bartender scene, and Kennedy was absolutely masterful. From this scene on, the rest of the film is a romp. There was much luck with the sequences with Jacky the lion, so Sturges must have lived a charmed life. All the performances shine 
 This was an interesting book - the writing wasn't bad, so it was entirely readable and decent in comparison to many chick-lit books. But, there were a lot of problems with the main character, Ashley, and her relationship with those around her. The book is Christian in theme, and there are several references to Ashley's spirituality and church activities. As a non-Christian I wasn't bothered by the religious references but by the story overall. This is the third in a series of Ashley Stockingdale books, and since I didn't read the first 2, perhaps I'm not as familiar with Ashley as some others are. But, I was very unimpressed by Ashley and her lack of backbone when it came to dealing with her own life and future. She was completely overrun by her fiances' family - his mother and sister in particular - Ashley let them belittle her constantly and make her look like less than a woman in front of Kevin, her fiancé. It wasn't until the final 2 or 3 pages that Ashley stood up for herself and even then, it seemed uncharacteristic of her. You just know that the problem was not resolved and that Ashley and Kevin will have a terrible marriage. There was very little expression of love between Ashley and Kevin too - a few kisses here and there were not enough t convince me that they had a tight bond - Kevin was gone a majority of the time, he didn't stick up for Ashley when his family belittled her, and he expected her to give up her life and dreams to move to another state with him. He mentioned they would discuss the move, but basically he gave her an ultimatum - marry me and move or see ya. I'm not sure I want to be Christian if Ashley is representative of the principles and actions that Christian women take for their man. For a much better glimpse of a Christian woman and the choices they make, I'd recommend the book "Emily Ever After" instead. 
 I'm appalled at this marketing.  I've read every book Mr. Woods has written and have enjoyed them all.  This type of marketing should not be allowed. It would have been simple to make the Cover obvious as to contents.  For those who have not read the novels it's a good deal, otherwise very disappointing advertising 
 This book is very bad. First of all, I have a problem with the so called rich playboy that runs off to serve in an intelligence agency as a ground agent in WWII. Yes the US and UK did have some ivy league types running around but the really good agents and operators were not the Ivy league types. They were more of the street wise types that had a good understanding of common sense as well as espionage. The author of this book - which I don't believe is Mr. Ludlum - never really took the time or energy to focus on producing a good story that makes sense.   On the spending of funds: Even intelligence agents have spending limits and are not allowed to just come out of their personal bank account but this character acted as if funding was never an issue.   On the hero's training or lack of it: If you look at the "hero" of the story you would see that he seemly had no real intelligence training. I'm sorry but having a lot of money to put down and sleeping around doesn't make a good agent. In fact that is the type of thing that makes someone a danger to the mission.   On the actions of the counter intelligence agents: The fact that the enemy agent/bad guy was always there. Keep in mind that in most of the cases there was no logical reason for the agent to always understand his location but somehow they were in the area.   Now I will talk about the heros contacts. This got under my skin because his contacts were not even trained very well nor they were not in the right position to be useful to the mission.   About the agent's cover: With no logical way to go under cover after he was found out by the bad guys - why was he never killed by the enemy or relocated by his leaders? I have a hard time believing that he was important enough to follow in the book but not to kill off? That just doesn't sound like a major agent to me.   On the agents level of unlimited luck:. One thing that you will see in the book is the amazing level of luck that never ran out and the fact that this man was so sexy that women couldn't turn him down. That is just silly.   On the myth of spy romance: The last thing that really makes the story really silly is the fact that he spent most of his time acting on a past love affair. Intelligence agents and operators do not have the time to fool around with lover's on missions. In fact you don't have time the have love affairs with women of quality because that takes too much time and energy as well as remove the agent's head out of the game - therefor at best all the agent can really go for are [...], not high-class women in the limelight the way the hero of this story did.  I know that many people will not like this review - but that is mainly because they have no idea of what espionage is really about. A book of spy fiction can be much better then this. I know the book is fiction but it is just too hard of a pill to take. If you like stories that are more believable and targeted for intelligent readers with higher standards-then don't read this. Try the Unlikey Spy by Danial Silva    
 I  was disappointed for the first time with a Merle Haggard CD. This one is a waste of time and money. I am  saying this and I think Merle is one of the best singers and song writers that I  have known. I have all of his CDs 
 I was amazed to see that other people found this book helpful. I ordered it to put together a presentation seminar in Switzerland. I could not use anything from this dreadful compilation of trivialies. There is no structure, the author superficially jumps from one idea to the other. The situations presented are, for the vast majority of us, irrelvant and unworthy of discussion such as: how to act at a business apero, sneak out of a meeting, talk on the phone etc. (in fact, if the advice were good, it could conceivably be helpful in such an occurrance-- But I thought this was about presentations!!); the book tries to be a self-help guide, a fashion consultant, motivation pamphlet, and fails on all fronts. It has the intellectural firepower of 17 magazine, except I picked out much better tips from my sister's old magazines. The author seems to be a successful practictioner, which I found astonishing, that someone with a track record in the field of presentation coaching could write such an awful book. 
 I was a bit disappointed in this book. The designer's style seems very one note-I have to agree it's kind of a rero rehash-that looks dated to me. I think it's a fun book for the generation x folks who might think this sort of thing looks fresh and new. To someone a bit older, who has seen this stuff in it's original form, it just looks like a 60's stage set 
 The scandal regarding Ambroses's plagiarism come home to roost in this mediocre effort. The "book" is actually a collection of thinly related anecdotes, many less than a paragraph in length, haphazardly pasted together between the bindings. In fact, Ambrose in places plagiarized himself, cutting and pasting passages from his other publications.  Moreover, it is apparent from the uneven editing and shifting writing styles that several authors were at work here, at least two of whom lack basic english skills. Themeless, incoherent, cursory, and on occasion simply wrong historically, this publication hardly merits the effort to turn the pages. In essence, while many of the little stories are interesting, the book fails on all levels. It is too cursory to be regarded as a serious history, yet lacks the coherence necessary to stand as a survey of the last ten months of the war. The writing style is too sophomoric to qualify as a "young adult" work, much less as "adult." Both the writing style and the depth of analysis are appropriate for preteens, but many of the anecdotes are too graphic and much of the language too salty for its inadvertently intended audience. It must be regarded a shame that those who purportedly heaped praise upon the work couldn't be bothered to read it first. Apart from several alleged quotations, there is nothing here that a college freshman couldn't accumulate by spending a few days in any decent university library 
 This book is an easy read, but unsettling. The anecdotes are particularly engaging. Yet, several of the themes in this book seem more to mislead rather than help the reader understand the nature of organizational politics. Reardon implies that there is an exclusive insiders group, which one can enter using political savvy. It makes for a good marketing since everyone wants to know `secrets' to success.  However, this exclusive insider's club is more myth than reality. More realistically, there are those who have high credibility with each other. One's credibility with others is worth its weight in gold and is indispensable for career success.  Such credibility is earned, sometimes by favoritism but more often by competency and gaining the trust of others. Being part of several credibility networks can increase one's favorable visibility. Learning how to use these networks can amplify one's influence.     Reardon suggests that being politically astute is more important than job performance. Sometimes that is the case, but more often job performance is necessary, if not sufficient.  Reardon seems to have bought into the amoral Machiavellian stereotype of organizational politics. She says, "Simply put, politics is an illegitimate means of getting things done." President Harry Truman said, "Politics is the art of getting things done." He was not known as an amoral man.      Getting active in politics without an ethical base creates the risk of coming across as a `shark'. This perception can actually lower one's credibility with important others.  Reardon defines political savvy as an interpersonal skill. This definition unfortunately omits the strategic level. Charting influence strategies, people can make things happen by navigating issues through turbulent political waters. In contrast, this book seems more about local face-to-face politics than organizational politics and more about getting ahead than getting things done.       Where this book shines is when it comes to communication skills related to politics and political situations and in its balance of both genders in its anecdotes.  In addition, it contains important insights for defending one's self against negative politics. The quizzes included in the book provide valuable diagnostics about one's negotiating and leadership styles. 
 Good points about the book: easy to read, simple to follow, new perspective (Ayurvedic view of health and disease) but there are a few points worthy to take note of: 1. The writers stress that food have to be cook for better digestion (i agree), but they do not say that uncook food is very important for health and cancer preventation too. Any cook food will be lacking of enzymes which are very important for cancer preventation. Jucing is a way out for people with weak digestion. i recommend reading a book written by Max Gerson: Cancer Therapy. 2. They recommend Tumeric milk. Tumeric is good to prevent cancer, i agreed; but dairy products like milk may not, instead it may indirectly be a contributing factor towards losing our health.  3. Lastly, contradicting philosophy. First they tell us that a clean body (clean cell;pg 117-8) will prevent cancer, but later they seem to agree that chemo therapy as a good therapy for cancer treatment (pg151-5; 170)which itself will "dirty" our health greatly, increasing our chances of getting cancer.   just my humble reflections 
 If you are a closed-minded member of Christendom's juggernaut, this book is for you! If you want unbiased truth about smaller groups, you'll have better results from other publications 
 An amazing transformation came over me while reading this book. No, I did not turn into a lizard or a bird. Never before have I experienced such an enormous swing in my state of mind while reading a book. No classic has moved me so much. No works of Hume, nor Kant, nor even Harry Potter's chambermaid have driven in me such a force of wild-eyed realization as compared with this amazing collection of words. I will do my best to describe the story, without boxing your ears or tugging my braid.  The story starts like all of Jordan's stories do, which is to say that an avalanche of words were used to describe such mundane things as grass and horse eye lashes. Nevertheless, Jordan's indispensable and uncanny knack for stringing words together kept me in the game. I had read the first seven books in the series and knew what I was up against. This was nothing. A hundred, two hundred, or even fifty thousand words to describe yet another immature dialog between a pair of immature people wedged in an altogether immature scenario would never get me down.  But as time wore on, it started to wear on me. Like water over a rock, my meddle started to wan, slowly washing away with the sands of the wheel of time. I began zoning out, unable to focus on the words on the page before me, finding myself having read an entire paragraph with no recollection of having done so. I wondered, am I really taking an SAT test? All my previous training seemed to have left me. My eyes were failing me, my brain quitting. I was aghast. This series of books that had heretofore been as straight in it's narrative as a pentangle was bogging down more than I thought even possible. I was losing interest. The flame was going out.  But I dug deep. I concentrated on the void, the endless void, the taint of Boredom making the void sickly sweet and palpable in my veins. I could taste it, it's sickening blackened bleary broken bleakness trying to take over my mind, my body, my soul. I controlled it. And with that control, Jordan's world of Boredom coursed through my veins like a pat of hot butter on a toasted English muffin on a hot summer day in Florida when the air conditioner is broken.  Shortly I had discovered the long lost Talent of Skimming. What had previously taken hours to read now took minutes! Pages down in seconds, chapters in no time at all. Boredom? Shredded to bits. Single words picked here and there, dialog grasped in an instant when the words "boxed" or "grasped" sprung from the page. I was alive, I was being tainted by Boredom! The lost Talent of Skimming, an astoundingly rare yet miraculously rediscovered Talent much like others I came across while reading this book, made me feel more alive than ever. Not to be outdone, Skimming was joined by Sleeping, Ignoring, Laughing, Putting Down, and Reading Something Else. All amazing powers in their own right, but nothing to hold a candle to Skimming.  In no time, Jordan's 8th book came to a close, and the narrative was no closer to being resolved than if all the characters had jumped into a blender and pressed the puree button, using the One Power of course. I mean, how else would they press the puree button if they were *in* the blender? I dare say that it would be improbable.  In any event, this book was so bad that the time invested in all 8 can't keep me coming back for a 9th. Fool me 8 times, shame on you. Fool me 9, shame on me 
 More than two million jobs disappeared from the U.S. between '01 and '04 - half a million in high-tech industries alone. Further, Steven Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, estimates that there have been about 8 million fewer jobs in the current recovery than would have been expected from prior history, and most of the new jobs come with low wages and few benefits.    Berger knows these numbers have caused a rising fear that no American job is safe from low-wage countries.  To discover whether these fears are justified, Berger and a group of MIT researchers visited over 500 workplaces and factories around the world.  Their conclusion is that cheap labor is not the answer.   This conclusion is currently true in some instances; however, the authors fail to see that cheap labor (the "China price") is increasingly dominating decision-making - both in services and manufacturing.  Jobs that formerly were not candidates for outsourcing (finance, market research, industrial design, computer systems design, paralegal research, reading X-rays) now are; strategies that previously fought off Asian alternatives often fail to work several years later as China and India adopt new techniques; in fact the authors often cite previously highly successful American companies that subsequently succumbed.    G.M. and Ford are additional examples where this may yet happen - despite years of world-leadership. Part of their problem was believing that they could let Japan have the low-cost market - this worked for awhile, but now Toyota et al have applied the lessons learned in that market segment, and leveraged their distribution etc. systems on to producing competitive SUVs and innovative hybrids as well.  Meanwhile, Toyota sees Korea and China as its most formidable future challenges, and despite its vaunted Toyota Production System, maintaining direct control throughout all stages (so does Microsoft, but that hasn't kept it from substantial outsourcing to India), and co-locating with suppliers, is seriously looking at China.  Remember Visteon and Delphi (Ford and G.M.'s former parts arms)?  Spinning them off was supposed to encourage more companies to utilize them, and it worked - for a time.  Today's successes are far too often ephemeral!  To be fair, the authors also point out that studies and analyses on the impact of outsourcing reach conclusions all over the map.  However, I think the most accurate (and certainly highly credible) conclusion is that of former MIT economist (and Nobel prize-winner) Paul Samuelson - globalization should increase the world's total income and average standard of living, but there's no reason to think any particular country or region's advances will outweigh its losses.  Berger, et al, also go on to recommend substantially improving American education.  The "bad news" is that this has been tried for at least 30 years, with little impact.  Further, others have determined that Asian IQs average about ten points over that of American whites.  Regardless, what difference would improving education make, even if we did achieve equality with Asian outcomes, when the workers are paid but a fraction of Americans?  Berger does mention the rationale for foreign corporations choosing to continue building millions of cars in the U.S. - laws requiring U.S. content.  Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes, BMW, Subaru, VW and others have built large plants in the U.S. as a result of this act.  However, the authors fail to recognize this as a potentially strong and viable overall solution to the hollowing of America.  Another important omission is the problem of outsourcing large numbers of jobs to illegals within this country - in fact, Berger et al reference a situation involving such as a solution!  Estimates are that AT LEAST nine million illegals from Mexico are here - depressing wage levels and stealing jobs that Americans formerly did. And what about the large number of Canadian truck drivers within the U.S. - soon to be augmented by Mexicans. (There are NO American truck drivers in Mexico that I know of, and very few that I've seen in Canada.) Then there is the self-inflicted problem of L1 and H1B visas bringing hundreds of thousands more, albeit legally.  While technically not "outsourcing," the impact of each of the preceding is the same.  Another thought from some "experts" is that sending off the lower-level jobs allows the U.S. to focus on "higher level" jobs such as innovation.  That's ridiculous for at least two reasons:  1)Manufacturing, for example, involves more than drilling, welding, molding, etc.  It also involves design, production management, production layout, machine design, etc.  These are NOT low-level jobs, nor is operating highly technical equipment.  2)How are all the displaced workers going to become eg. biomedical researchers, rocket scientists, etc.?  (Oh yes, the Chinese and Indians are moving into those areas also; I have encountered a number of Americans who took recommended training in new areas after being "outsourced" from a long-term occupation only to become outsourced again.)  Also missing from "How We Compete" is any discussion and recommendation on healthcare.  Auto manufacturers repeatedly claim that having to pay healthcare for their employees adds $1,000+ cost to each car - creating government-funded universal healthcare like other nations would help save jobs in America.  "How We Compete" address an important topic - however, its focus on CURRENT approaches (vs. trends) results in conclusions that are seriously over-optimistic.  (Inadequate analysis by Berger and others helps explain the maze of contradictory conclusions on this topic; political and economic motivations of short-sighted clients are additional drivers.)  Eight million jobs here, nine million there, etc., etc. - it adds up and hurts a lot.  Meanwhile, America's competitive status declines daily and our government does little or nothing in defense 
 I was very disappointed with this book- I expected to learn something new about the soldiers of the Red Army in WW2 but instead I got the same picture of a green/brown filthy primitive horde which inhabits many other (especially German) books on the Soviet Army. Most of the book is about how bad the Red Army and the Soviet Union were. The daily lives and motivations of the soldiers are really treated in a cursory manner and the author seems to get frustrated when the vets relating their experiences don't tow her neocon party line- eg.: "Ilya Natanovich ought to remember Stalin with disgust... But what the veteran remembers, with a smile of recognition, is an attitude that borders on religious faith...". Throughout the book any positive memories of Red Army veterans are always countered with five stories about corruption or incompetence or cowardice or the evils of Soviet Communism. But we know from history that far from falling apart the Soviet Army held on against unbelievable odds to become the best land army of its time bar none! You'd never know this from reading this book which joins many recent Western books which recount the story of the Eastern Front only to denigrate the Russians. There is a long section of the book which seeks to show how anti-Semitic the Russians were when in fact compared to an other army of the time (including the US Army) they were the least rascist. There is also alot of moralising at the end of the book about the Russians treatment of the German population at the end of the war- again after a giving the hideous German occupation short shrift. So in the end it's the usual amorphous smelly commy Soviet subhumans fighting in the service of evil Communism who are described. A real disappointment to anyone hoping for an actual social history of   Red Army soldiers in WW2. They remain as inscrutable as ever 
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been "founded by whites from the North". Fact is, there were no "whites" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race "browns". 
 The first movie was fresh and creative. This sucks. It takes the elements of the first film and dumbs them down to the point where you ask "Why?" and "Huh?" and scream "Noooooooo!" when you look back and see how much you've payed for the rental or purchase.  The security guard from the first movie tells a film student the story about what happened to her involving the urban legend serial killer, so then obviously the film student decides to make a movie about a serial killer who murders people based on urban legends. Then...*GASP*- People start getting killed by someone replicating urban legends!!!!!!!!!!!  There are numerous scenes and plotlines that make no sense like one character who makes a terrific movie gets killed, then his twin brother who nobody has ever seen EVER shows up (played by the same actor) to help solve the murders with our young heroine. The twist ending here is sooooo stupid and really makes you wonder why they couldn't actually come up with a twist that was worth your time spent watching this trash.  If you're in the mood for a better albeit STILL UNORIGINAL sequel, go for the third movie 'Urban Legends: Bloody Mary' (which rips off 'Prom Night 2', but is better than that and this anyway) 
 All the "tricks" in the studio and special sound effects cannot hide the fact that Janet Jackson is indeed a very weak "singer."  I've always contended that she was firstly a dancer.  Overall, I don't consider people talented, who need 30 to 40 dancers behind them with explosions and light shows to destract from the fact that the "singer" cannot sing.  I didn't buy this, I heard it at a friend's house and thought it pathetic.  You can hardly hear Ms. Jackson, she seems to be singing from the room upstairs while the microphone and orchestra are downstairs!  I confess, I have never purchased one of her albums and never will.  I lean more towards singers that can really BLOW.  This lady just whimpers 
 Based on the reviews my expectations were higher than they should have been.  I spent some time listening to the CD and frankly I was disappointed with the lack of direction of any of the cuts.  It just meandered from one cut to another and I felt no sense of attachment to any of the pieces.  There is no sense of adventure or becoming part of the music - in fact I thought it was worse than elevator musi 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
         Warning: this review reveals many things about the book but nothing about the movie. I don't know how they could say that this movie is based on the book. The only thing that is really the same is the burglary in the beginning. I know how movies based on books how to cut out many parts to make it fit until the right amount of time but i never thought that they could take out the main charactor and hero. Jack Graham was the best part of the book and Clint Eastwood cut him out to make himself the main charactor. Also they made the billionare Walter Sulivan seem like a complete idiot because Luther had to tell him who killed his wife. Sulivan was a very smart man and figured it out by himself. This movie cut out many important factors of the book that made it more suspenseful. Deaths like: Walter Sulivan, Luther Whitney, Sandy Lord, Sandy Lord's mistress, and Bill Burton. I am suprised that they even killed Christy Sulivan in the first place. Also they left out many key elements of the book such as: Jack for a big one, Russell and Collin's affair, the knife being destroyed, everyones death that I mentioned before, and Kate's relationship with her father.       This movie pissed me off very much becuase it left out all of the suspence that Baldacci put in. I mean when Luther kills Collin it sounds like something straight out of Dirty Hairy "Mercy," said Collin "I fresh out," replied Luther. I mean come it's cool for an action movie with no plot but this book is one of my favorites and the movie ruined my mental image of it. Don't see the movie but I recommend the book 
  M. Gary Neuman puts fear in the hearts of my married people. His notion that emotional infidelity is more dangerous than a sexual affair because everyone wants emotional attachments, is more a scare tactic rather than good advice.   If you look at his rules, then anyone who has an emotional attachment outside of marriage is guilty of infidelity. Best-friends, close siblings, parents, children from a previous marriage, could all fall into these rules. You could have an emotional affair with your mother or your best friend.   Instead of focusing on real issues that cause "jealousy" Neuman blatantly says that we should avoid and be on guard for those people who might even want a friendship.   This whole concept is wrong.   There are better books and better sources to read 
 "Hailing from across the ideological spectrum" "twenty-one of the writers who have thought longest and hardest about immigration" - what a joke! Only one immigration sceptic, George Borjas, is allowed a voice; the rest are all drawn from the shop-worn ra-ra neocon pro immigration chorus, with a few leftists thrown in, whom TJ must have known in her college days. Even worse,as Steve Sailer points out in "Remythologizing the Melting Pot" on VDARE.com, she displays no grasp on  statistics and allows her writers to contradict themselves on matters of fact, such as why the German 19 Century influx was assimilated. Far better, in view of President Bush's Amnesty/Open Borders proposal to read Borjas' "Heavens Door" 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 If you are skilled with computers this book is not for you. I was very disappointed. No "secrets" here. Just common everyday stuff I already knew. Previous Windows Secrets books were MUCH better 
 Usually my favorite book is the one I'm reading at the time.  However, Gardenias for Breakfast is my All Time Favorite Book EVER!!  I have given several copies for gifts and have shared my copy numerous times.  I think if you were a Mother of girls, you would especially relate to this book.  I do not have daughters, but, I am a daughter and I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Robin Jones Gunn is just a fantastic painter of word pictures and she shines in this book 
 Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this 
 If you want to learn anything new about JFK jr. do NOT read this book.  The book is basically one long whine-fest about why the magazine "George" failed (hint to Blow: because it was stupid!).  Richard Blow apparently saw in the death of Kennedy his one shot at fame--nothing else had worked.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Bridget FOnda at her best performance? Guy, this is a lousy picture, where everything is wrong: the director seems to don't know what to do with the weak script he had in its hands; Sutherland and Ann-Miller seems to be  working to pay their bills, only; and Bridget confused the order to act  like a deaf woman and acted as a sleepy girl all movie long !  Every minute  watching this pocture was wasted, but I rented it because of the cast. Sad  mistake.. 
 This book begins with ill-conceived premises and gets even worse.  The author begins with the contention that the French philosophes invented compassion, sympathy, and egalitarianism in the 18C.  Only somebody who knows little about religion, and nothing about Christianity, could make such an asinine statement.  Christianity's first commandment is agape, or uncritical love for others.  Christianity was also unique in that it accorded the same rights to salvation to slaves as it did to kings.  Granted, Christians frequently fail to live up to Christ's moral standards, but that is beside the point.  Ms Hunt argues that these concepts were unknown.    The secular notion of egalitarianism, on the other hand, is patently absurd.  Since all people are different and unique, no two people are equal in either endowments or outcomes.  The author utterly fails to draw this crucial distinction.  Ms Hunt frequently conflates and confuses historical circumstances.  She celebrates the egalitarian spirit of the French Revolution while remaining absolutely deaf to its atrocities and excesses; ditto with that other egalitarian scourge, Communism.  She does the same with slavery, confusing the different patterns that occurred at different times, and at different places.  European slavery, prior to opening the new world, consisted primarily of women and children captured during conflict.  Usually, their humanity was not in question.  Yes, they were frequently used cruelly, but that cruelty was a mere pittance when compared with Communists, and other purveyors of egalitarianism and high-flown notions of human rights, such as Ms Hunt.  Rather than address these issues, Ms Hunt dismisses criticism with the haughty contempt that characterizes today's liberal elites.  She concedes the many atrocities committed in the name of human rights and egalitarianism, such as the current war in Iraq, but fails to understand that these disasters are merely foregone conclusions resulting from her faulty premises.  She cites the US Bill of Rights as an early commitment to human rights.  It was no such thing.  Rather, it was a guarantee that the federal government would respect the customary rights demanded by American citizens.  The fact is rights are very particular, and not all rights are recognized everywhere.  For instance, few Muslim nations would recognize freedom of religion--one of the West's most cherished rights.  The Constitution was written to protect the rights of American citizens because the framers understood what Ms Hunt fails to understand:  that rights are customary and emanate from particular cultures, and that most of the founding fathers quickly became disillusioned with the radical ideas emanating from the French Revolution.  The other concept that seems to give Ms Hunt so much difficulty is that other than being inherently absurd, radical egalitarianism is a guise for those who wish to assert superior rights.  When, for instance, black civil rights leaders argue for, say, affirmative action or blacks-only dorms in college, these "equal rights" apply only to blacks.  Indeed, all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.  It's sad that Ms Hunt fails to understand this very simple concept.  How many more innocent victims of equality and human rights will have to die on the altar of her ideas?  Readers interested in the history of egalitarianism and human rights would be much better served reading Thomas Fleming's "Morality of Everyday Life" 
 great book if you are a moron that is.my god what a pathetic creature pat robertson must be.its premise seems to be that the steps to spiritual revival is  "hate your neighbor".chapter after chapter seem to revolve around finding "non believers" and having them arrested or deported under false charges if need be.what kind of person writes a book like this? and what kind of editor allows the syntax and spelling errors found in this horrid little pamphlet 
 I was very disappointed in this item. They stickers did not stay in the book. they would fall off or only part of them would stick . would never buy again. it would have been great if they did.concept is very nic 
 It was not one of the "seminal" investment books that the author  believes it is.  Very modest of him wouldn't you say.  However, price to  sales ratio analysis can work wonders for your portfolio.  O'Shughnessy's  book illustrates that in the fullness of time, the ratio is one of the best  ways to value a stock.  It would have been better if Fisher could have  provided more historical insight into the ratio.  But it is the only book  that i know of that delves that deeply into this technique.  I am just  turned off by his arrogance 
 The only reason I completed this silly, disappointing novel was because I had just finished all of Welty's remarkable short stories and her flawless novella, "The Optimist's Daughter."  It's as if a completely different author had written this superficial, fatuous novel.  If you desire to read about 20 forgettable people in a seriously inbred family speaking at the same time about the impending wedding of one of their own, then this novel is for you.   The only explanation for this work is that it came very early in Welty's career.  I realize that others have defended this novel as revealing quintessential Southern dialogue and acute psychological tension in the characters.  While the dialogue is clearly of the South, it is senseless, repetitive and tedious, and the characters dash madly in and out of the novel, without making any lasting impression on this reader. Instead, read Welty's short stories and "The Optimist's Daughter" and you will discover a totally different Welty:  one whose fully realized characters and profound psychological insights will leave you with the enduring belief in her genius.     
 This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool 
 This book is not appropriate for children who are too young to separate fantasy from fact.  It contains images of danger and death and the main character, Jemima, is portrayed as inept and stupid.  I realize that millions of kids have enjoyed this book over the years, but my child will have to wait until she's old enough to understand these concepts and not be frightened by them 
 I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a "1 + 1 = 3" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is "If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie."   As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.  I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.   As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?   I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right? Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.  In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want. Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.   In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.  
 how about season 1..im tired of their greed!! do it right or dont do it at all!! i dont own any of the volumes 1-5 and i never will.im a huge scooby fan and would love to see these released by COMPLETE SEASONS instead of the stupid (out of order) volumes they come out with.PEOPLE IF YOU WANT COMPLETE SEASONS THEM PLEASE DONT BUY THIS.the only reason they do this is to take your money.lets force them to do it right by not buying these stupid volume 
 I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me 
 The songs are great but the transfer to digital form was done poorly. The tracks sound terrible. The volume was jacked up way to high and the low  frequencies are overwelming. If your looking for the extended version of goodbye horses, I recommend getting it either on the clerks 2 soundtrack(it sounds great on clerks 2) or spend the money on the original 12 inch single. All the other tracks can be found on their original 12 inch vinyl releases on online auctions for reasonable prices. So in love by Omd is a great song but its sounds terrible on this release. Dont bother buying this cd if you like quality sounding music. 
 I found this system disorganized, inefficient and ultimately ineffective for learning Spanish.   There is too much English on the tape and very little conversational or cultural context.  A good system would have dialog presented in context with lots of repetition and building drills and minimal English explanation on tape.  Or maybe put the explanation on separate CD tracks so that it can be skipped after it is heard a time or two.   By the way, the CD tracks seemed to be cut-up randomly and had very little flow or consistency.    I have not tried any of the other systems but this one was a disappointment 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 I am a huge Batman fan.  Batman the Animated Series is one of the most watched items in my DVD collection.  I don't think I'll make it through this atrocity once.  It definitely looks as if it's made for kids, but my kids (aged 7 and 10) are not taken in by this charade.  They know what the Joker is supposed to look like and how he is supposed to act and sound.  This thing is an abomination 
 After reading the editorial review which stressed this was a book for "birth and the years beyond", about "pregnancy and parenting" I incorrectly assumed it would be a fun read for me as the mom of a two-year-old. Probably it would have been a great read before I had my baby, but once you've been through it you've pretty much figured out all this stuff yourself - even if it is much more cleverly and humorously expressed by the author 
 I am a professional artist for 30 years, I am just getting to the time in my career where I want to pull the aBstracts out of my sketch Books and work them into what used to Be my representational large art ,and Be more comfortaBle. So not only am I looking for other aBsract forms and shapes, But for me, the mayBe 15-20 paintings in color( I didn't need to see his Black and White paintings in color)When I saw the colored front page, I was excited to see what Motherwell had done with color.  There must have Been 90 photo opportunites to show the command of, or his lack of command, when it came to color.  I mean could you imagine 1/10 of any aBstract -expressionist Being in color , leaving us to image 9/10 in Black and White of DeKooning, or Pollock,or Davis,or Hans Hoffman,on and on.  I will see if I can send this Back.  I feel tricked, and that I paid top dollar, for an editor ( and I don't know how they thought they could get away with it)But...to you , the Editors of this Book, STOP printing Now, and spend much , much more on color and you will douBle your sales.  If I would have seen this Book in full in a Book store , I would have memorized the short shaft of color paintings and gone on to look for one on Motherwell  that had much more color.  You see, when ABstract Expressionists are shown, they 9 out of 10 will use the Black and White paintings of Motherwell....so most of us, I would think have a need to see his work in color.....Yes, I am disappointed...Can I send this Back? 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 I think this book may work for those who are really against letting their babies cry, but I have to say, if you are truly sleep deprived, trying to remember all of the things you're supposed to do at 2 am (and 3 am, 4 am, etc.) is nearly impossible. When I would wake up in the wee hours with my son, I couldn't remember all of the methods she described, and it wasn't like I could read the book right then! If you are really committed to this type of method, I would think it would work pretty well, but in my completely exhausted state, trying to remember several different steps to help my baby back to sleep made me more frustrated 
 Who wudda thunk it?  Chris Russo can read and write 
 If you're looking for one stop book on everything Austin, then this might help.  For us, it tried to cover too many areas, and lacked personality.  We're in the market for a new book 
 Haven't yet reviewed the DVD, but the book really wasn't very good. Oh well, here's hoping the DVD will be better 
 Intellectually the book is drivel, a high-school level history of the United States wherein Barone gets to label things as either Soft or Hard(he actually capitalizes the adjectives.  Hard he likes (the GI Bill, FHA mortgages), Soft he don't (Welfare, Social Security, most modern education.).  It is short, an hour should get you through it.  You might want to start at the end because it is so repetitive in its approach you won't get past the 60's otherwise.  I jumped to the end and my impression is things turn out well.  Things are going well in Iraq (because the army is now Hard, unlike the Vietnam era Softies), and so on. The blurbs in my library copy indicate that Barone is considered some type of intellectual by the right.  For this reason it is worth checking out to see how little ability is required to achieve that status.  I had the same reaction a few years ago reading a book by Thomas Sowell ("This is one of their leading thinkers?????").  Some reviewers praise Barone's balanced view (he doesn't foam at the mouth a la, say, Ann Coulter, but there is no mistaking his selectivity or willingness to assert without evidence that which will make his audience happy and sell this little book 
 Based upon the very good reviews, I was expecting something better. Someone said on "Lover Awakened" forum that it was a very good read, while waiting for J.R. Ward to produce her next opus. Very similar writing ... Alas, I could not find anything similar ... I found the book boring. Could not finish it, stopped at page 100 and browsed until the last page to see what happened ...  Even the cover is not OK (look at the PAWS of the male !)  Would have rated ZERO stars if possible ... 
 I'm an animation fan, and when this came up recommended to me I was eager to check it out. While the animation was fine (although a tad creepy), I found the story off-putting. Its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a.k.a substance "D."  I found  this film depressing and annoying. I particularly found the 'blur suit' to be distracting to watch. It almost gave me a headache.   1 star. Did not like 
 WHY SHOULD WE TAKE ANYTHING THIS AUTHOR SAYS SERIOUSLY. HE'S LAST AND ONLY OTHER BOOK WAS A NATIONAL ENQUIRER STYLE TELL OR -- OR RATHER TELL NOTHING -- ABOUT A FRIEND WHO TRUSTED HIS CONFIDENCE -- JFK JR. BRADLEY CANT EVEN USE HIS REAL NAME -- RICHARD BLOW. HE'S A PHONY AND HE DECIDED TO TRY TO ADD SOME PANACHE TO HIS ALLEGED ROLE AS A WRITER BY DOING A "SERIOUS BOOK ABOUT AN INSTITUTION." I READ THE BOOK...IT'S ALL SPECULATION BASED ON ZERO RESEARCH. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A CUT AND PASTE JOB. FORGET IT. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. 
 After waiting 3-4 weeks, it finally arrived! To my grandchildrens dismay. It did not perform as advertised. There wasn't any volcano erupting, all it did was sprinkle a small amount from the side. Yes we did have good water pressure, and it was put together correctly! I just want my money and shipping charges back! Thank you for your expediency on this return 
 "The Koreans have established a group they call the anti-Japanes Communist party. Koreans were part of the Japanese Empire but hated the Japanese and hated the war." quote from page. 89 This book has a high risk of being misread by people who are not aware of the Korea-Japan history. Japan brutally "invaded" Korea. The author knows this. But she still describes Korea as if it is supposed to be part of Japan.   If you are not aware of the history, you would think "damn those Korean communists, why do they hate Japanse? What's wrong with them?" Imagine,  "Netherland people have established a group they call anti-German Communist party. Netherland was part of the German Empire but hated the Germans and hated the war." Would you want your kids who are not aware of the German invasion, to read this and think that Netherland people were wrong?  The book describes Koreans as cruel, barbarious people who tries to harm innocent Japanese people, who are described as the victims.  Come on!! Japanese were the invaders, and Koreans were the victims!! The hardships that she goes through is because of all the atrocities that Japanes has committed to Koreans!!   This is a well written book, but if it can form a misconception about history, it should not be recommended by school teachers to their students.  Especially, the Japanese still have not apologized for all the atrocities they have done to Koreans, Chinese, and other Asian countries. At least Germans have apologized for what they've done. I'm very sure there are much better books that can be recommended.   The author's father was a high official who worked in manchuria, where Unit 731 was using Koreans and Chinese people like lab mice to test their biological weapons.  Search Unit 731 in wikipedia if you don't know what I'm talking about. Search Asian Holocaust, for other atrocities that Japan has committed.

 Maybe my expectations were too high.  This heating pad does not get hot enough; not nearly as hot as others I've used.  The massage feature is not effective and is simply two speeds of vibration  I bought this one because I was attracted to the thickness of the pad.  I've had problems with other heating pads bunching and folding up too much.  If this one only got hotter it would be nice; I don't really care about the massage feature.  My heating pad hasn't broken yet as the other reviewer experienced.  I'm still using it for now 
 I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.    The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous.  You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle.  Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual.  This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether 
 Would have been a better book if the author had stuck to the subject of Freemasonry instead of spreading misinformation about the OTO.  The author does a disservice to the reader who might not know any better, as well to the many fine Masons who enjoy membership in both Freemasonry and the OTO.  Perhaps if he had spoken to one of these Brothers some of his misconceptions might have been corrected and I would encourage the Brother to consider interviewing a few Masons who are also OTO members for any subsequent editions or other books so that information is more factual and less sensationalized 
 I was placed on The Mediterranean Diet by my physician because I need drastic improvement in my cholesterol levels. If you are looking for ways to get started or for recipies, don't buy this book! Although Mr. Wright seems to have a winning reputation and the book is filled with authentic, flavorful recipies it does not relate to heart-based eating. The ingredients include eggs, full-fat yogurt, cheeses, shellfish such as shrimp, and butter. Choosing and buying this book was my mistake; I just don't you to make the same one! You will find it a complete waste of money if heart-health is your goal. Buy The Mediterranean Heart Diet by Helen V. Fisher instead 
  I enjoyed this movie. I orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies. I wouldn't really call it a porn movie. It's more of a movie with adult humor. I'd give it an "R" rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today 
 This was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read... I say attempted because I could not finish it.  This book was simply not worth my time.  Hallie was immature, self-centered, shrewish and selfish and we are supposed to believe that Jason found this attractive?  I cannot believe Catherine Coulter wrote this trype.  The situation of the two of them living in the same house during this time period was ridiculous.  And this book was an RT award nominee !!  What were those people thinking  
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 That anyone can read this book and conclude that it is an intelligent presentation is, well, not very analytical. This book is about as deep as a thimble flattened by a steam roller. Save your money, don't throw it away. I wish that more evangelical Christians were using their education to write thoroughly researched books without borrowing from others like C.S. Lewis (who was not an evangelical). Giles is not original, but then neither is Rick Warren in his "Purpose Driven Life" (he just borrows from tried and true psychology and mixes Bible verses in with it). So I wonder, "Who is reading this stuff?" Maybe some of the kids (the ones who are doing any reading at all), or some who put Harry Pothead down for a minute to read something else?? The church has gone a long way in my lifetime and it looks like it's just about to jump off the intellectual cliff 
 A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.    Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money.    
 This movie was only good because of two reasons.  RAMMSTEIN, and Queens of the Stone Age.  Other than that, completel out of control P.O.S. that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 I bought this for my granddaughter, and I have used 3 other mp3 players, and this one is horrible. Getting 2 different computers to recognize it was impossible. Hello, this is 2006, this stuff should just plug and play, I thought I was back to DOS, and I am pretty computer savvy. Anyway, save yourself and get an Apple, Dell or Phillips. WOW 
 Here began the death of all substantial poets 
 For those seeking more info about Dr. Villoldo's lack of detail and other concerns regarding truthfulness in contemporary shamanism, please see "The Selling of the Shaman and the Problem of Informant Legitimacy" which appears in the Summer 1990 issue of 'Anthropological Research', Volume 46, Number 2. Dr. Villoldo is prominently featured. 
 Never could connect with the main character in this book.  She mostly seems cold and impersonal to me.  She's described as "nice" by other characters in the book, but she's mostly condescending and rude to them, as when she tells the postman to "bugger off" after he tells her "good morning".  Didn't feel any warmth or affection for her family either.  They are superficially drawn and seem to have little connection to each other.  The husband is uninvolved and disinterested in his family's life.  Mostly disagrees with wife on everything.  The village seems lackluster and full of unhappy, discontented people.  Nothing charming or engaging about it to make one feel that it's "cosy".  Bleak and dreary is more like it.  Not much to the story line either.  I figured out the basic plot early on and I am usually the last to know what's going on.  Don't recomend this book at all 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 I was thrilled at the sound of this book and expected it to be filled with succint wisdom -- the type of wisdom you receive from friends' emails, save to a file or print, and never organize into a book.  However, it was really several longer narrations of the author's opinion on selected topics.  All in all, I found it to be of little value and quickly relegated it to my attic collection 
 This book is outdated. About all it has of any value is pretty pictures. There are much better books for the beginner out there. I found this out the hard way 
 I am most disappointed with this calendar for 3 reasons.  One I purchased it from a magazine listing it as problems to practice your math skills for ages 10 and up.  There is no way a 10 year old can do any of these problems.  Second, it does not point out where the solutions are (they are the day of the month).  Thirdly, as another reviewer pointed out, many of the problems are more trivia based rather than mathematical 
 This book I thought would be entertaining to me. I found out it was written by a white man from New England who grew up in an upper class family and went to a fine university. He moved to the ghetto for 2 years to "hang" with the Black people and "try to get things done" as he says. I found it to be a book of propaganda sending messages to people about how blacks are mistreated. I am black myself and thought the book had some ok stories from news clippings but overall the book was junk. I wouldn't get this one. Try Uncle Tom's Cabin 
 Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking.  My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious.  I, however, am left wondering:  why?    I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors.  The characters are boring and flat.  His humor is downright stupid.  This book is not clever in the least.  If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.    I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel.  But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.
