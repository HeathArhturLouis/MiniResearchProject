 Laure Redmond has got it figured out. She's real. She's having a great time. You almost become a better person just by reading the book 
 This was my reference of choice when I was an intern at a busy major children's hospital.  It's comprehensive, not too heavy to lug around, gives you the important details and gives you references as to where to go next for further reading.  It's not always enough information when it comes to specific cases.  I usually went to UpToDate, PedsinReview or lit searches at that point.  I think this is a solid book to have early in your career because it lets you cover the most relevant material in a readable manner.  As a second year, I don't go back to Currents as much and mostly go with articles.  
 What a heartbreak all the way around.  This book was informative and a great way to read history...without being bored.  Not that there was anything boring about this time period.  Highly recommend this 
 I bought this for my son on a whim one day.  I read it in the store, thought it was really cute and it made me laugh.  I didn't even think about all the barking "styles" until I got home and read it to my son, he giggles at my barks and our dog howls with me whenever I get to the howling page.  The dog comes into the room every time I read this to my son and hangs out till I'm done, so I guess you could say we all love this one 
 for being such a tyrant, for spoiling his daughters' wedding plans, and for RUINING their lives -- and believe me-- that kind of stuff REALLY went on in those days! And I wanted to shake some sense into her mother for PUTTING UP WITH THIS!!!  Sara Smolinsky's life  most probably parallels Anzia's real life. And if that is true, then I have the UTMOST respect for Sara/Anzia who against all odds, and especially as a woman back in the 1920's, found a place for herself and worked VERY hard to get that education and respect and "the good life" that all the  middle-class American kids took for granted.  Someone reading this book today -- who has not read any books on the Immigrant experience or who has not become aquainted with Immigrant life in America in the early 20th Century -- wouldn't have a CLUE as to what it was really like back then, and to them this book would perhaps only serve to confuse or bore (!) them. Hopefully this book will not only shake readers out of their complacency, but it will encourage them to read other books about the Immigrant experience, such as "call it Sleep" by Roth.  The Bread-Givers is a great book

Before you squander working capital on fancy advertising  campaigns, read this book.  Then you will learn that spending your money on  product formulation, service and support are the cornerstones to successful  marketing. This book provides exceptional real world examples of how to  grow a business by focusing on customer service solutions 
 This is quite simply the best story I've ever read.  Yes, it's insanely long and expansive, but it's well worth the time and effort it will take to read it.  I first read it in 1992 while I was travelling - I was looking for a good long book to help me cover empty hours on trains and buses.  I ended up finishing it in a week, so riveting it was that putting it down was not an option.  At first you may find yourself confused because of all the characters and intersecting story-lines, but that confusion quickly abates and you'll find yourself immersed in a world of political intrigue, big business, clashing cultures, love and loss, espionage, natural disasters, and one of the most compelling main characters you'll ever meet.  And it all takes place in the span of one week!!!  Like I said, I first read this book in 1992, and I've probably read it fifteen times since and enjoyed it just as much every single time.  Clavell's 'Asian Saga' is monumental in scope and each book is a masterpiece, but this is the pinnacle of them all.  You don't have to read the other books in the saga to enjoy Noble House, but you'll find yourself compelled to read the others once you're done with it and you won't be disappointed with any of them 
 One of the many great albums by the Count, this one has it all 
 Adding to Carol Summers words I too have given at least a dozen of these books as gifts. It is simply a great read and I don't even have a garden. The cover is absolutely a stunner. I would love to have a print of it.That quality continues to the last period. Bring it back  
 This product is working fine. i dont have any problem so far and also my internet connection is excellant with dlink modem and i am also using a dlink router 
 I purchased this for jogging.  I'm an average-size female and found these arm bands (I bought 2 so far) are too large for my arm.  The material is scratchy. I found it better to wrap it a couple of times around my wrist as that allows for easy access to the controls.  If I were a manufacturer, I would design for females.  Guess I just haven't found the right gizmo that works right for me 
 So you think you know it all? This slim, artfully produced, thorough glossary of terms is beautifully illustrated, has clear descriptions of all those mysterious processes on museum labels, including a few even you might not have known, and is as useful in a collector's library as in a contemporary practitioner's 
 Our oral history of the tales of "Cinderella" and "Sleeping Beauty" have certainly changed!  This is an excellent source for anyone hoping to find the roots of the fairy tales which we all know and love today.  Perrault's prose is surprisingly terse, which may grate with the modern conception of these tales, but he also holds nothing back.  Thankfully, Philip and Simborowski include all of his tales, even the dark and disturbing "Donkeyskin," which has been left out of most translations.  I have used this book as pleasure reading, but it really shines when I pull it off the shelf for serious essays and presentations.  Philip and Simborowski provide helpful anecdotes on Perrault's life and the stories themselves, rounding out a work as complete as Perrault's original 
   This is simply one of the best relationship books ever written. Both my wife and I read the book and completed the action items, and it has helped our marriage immensely. Chapman's insight into how to keep your partner's "love tank" full is innovative and practical. The book is written in easy to read chapters, and Chapman cites his work with other couples to illustrate specific points. By doing so, he gives the reader a "real world" examples of how understanding your partner's love language will strengthen your relationship and open communication. The reader can easily relate to these examples and identify with their challenges, and subsequent victories. My wife and I recommend this book to every couple we know, whether their relationship is good, bad or other 
 "Kimi Ga Suki" finally makes its stateside appearence on CD and, although it's not Sweet's best album, it can more than hold for the most part. The most melodic songs on the album like the rocking "Dead Smile" or "Through Your Eyes" will remind you of the best material from Sweet's "Girlfriend" or "Altered Beast". The production is a bit thinner and not as splashy or slick but that's no surprise given that Sweet recorded this at home. "Ocean in Between" recalls "Girlfriend" the most with an infectious hook, killer harmony vocals and a melody that ingrains itself into your brain almost from the first verse. As a result, everything from the best songs to some of the lesser ones have a flow unlike some of his previous albums.    The good news that many of his usual collaborators appear here including Television guitarist Richard Lloyd. His guitar work adds much needed bite to some of the weaker material which gives it a bit more substance. The home recording approach actually works in the album's favor making it difficult to pigeon hole the album's sound. While much of it does recall his previous material, the best songs tend to build on rather his other albums rather than standing at the same level. Adding to the charm is the fact that Sweet wrote the album straight through vs. accumulating songs over time and recorded them in a rush of activity over a week or so. This approach (like McCartney's on "Driving Rain")only adds to the quality of the songs and charm. There's no second guessing here as there wasn't much time to do it.     "Kimi Ga Suki" may be an imperfect album but it's an imperfect album packed with ingenious melodies, sharp playing and singing as well as musical ambition. Unlike another reviewer here, I actually did like "Thorns" and "In Reverse" as they both showed a willingness to step away from a sound that made him successful and take risks outside the power pop genre. 
 As a kid I remember being captivated by this rare and unique Fairy Tale version of Merlin, to this day I still watch and enjoy this epic story.  Reenacting the rise and fall of a king's wizard, Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) brings strength and compassion to a role that is often portrayed as an old and stiff grandpa.  Miranda Richardson does a wonderful job with both Queen Mab and The Lady of the Lake (Queen Mab is especially amazing, her beauty, Gothic undertones and harsh voice will make you swoon).  Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club) play's a young disheveled Morgan Le Fey, and Martin Short as Queen Mab's assistant Frik plays the films comedy relief.  A great addition for anyone who loves the hidden stories of any underrated sidekick 
 Dr. Hurd has successfully navigated his way through all the nonsense that makes up today's psychology profession and presents a no-nonsense and very clear approach.  Forget the whiners and the no-help social workers.  He  gives real solutions and real answers that work!  Dr. Hurd challenges  conventional wisdom on things like how to deal with alcoholism.  He gives  readers a whole new perspective about how to approach problems and how to  *solve* them, not merely "get by" or "deal with it."   Read this book *before* you consider therapy or some sort of self-help.   This is the best starting point I've ever come across for mental health 
 Edwards did a lively job of telling the stories of Abraham and his successors.  I enjoyed the quick read very much, but felt a great deal was left out too.  The viewpoint of the angels makes this series unique.  The  author uses creativity while holding to basic biblical teachings.  I wish  the story had been longer and a bit more in depth, as there were some  issues during this period of time that are complex and have been  interpreted many ways.  This is not a series for the serious Bible student,  but it is certainly an enjoyable journey that ends too soon.  I'll  definitely complete the series 
 My future daughter-in-law loved the book.  I gave it to her today for her birthday.  Very nice book and just what she wanted 
 If you like Country Music (real country music), this album is a "must-have".  Noone sang a song like Stonewall; and it's doubtful anyone ever will.  Not a bad song on the CD, but a few more songs would always be appreciated.  It's sad that this artist isn't more appreciated today, and as with many great pioneers and stylists of Country Music, he's overlooked.  If you like Stonewall, I suggest you also check out Mel Street, who seemed to be greatly influenced by Jackson and often imitated his singing approach.  In any case, you owe it to yourself to purchase this one 
 I've read this book numerous times and love it. The story line is good, the characters are well thought out and you are immersed completely in the context of their lives. I read it every few years again and always suggest it to others to read. It is not a hard read unless you are a "DaVinci Code" reader 
 This book contains only 4 new essays by Gore Vidal (about 50 pages), the other ones had already been published in his `United States Essays 1952-1992'.  Gore Vidal's attacks on the US government are ferocious and disturbing. He lambastes rightly the enormous US defense budget ('black hole Pentagon: what goes in is forever lost'), creating in fact socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor. The US Treasury transfers money to the various defense industries, which in turn pay for the elections of Congress and president. Gore Vidal sees the US republic governed by one political party, the Property Party, with two right wings. He sees US history as a `relentless attack of the prosperous few upon the rights of the restless many, often masked as the righteous will of the majority against the deviant few.' The words of the powerful are confuse so that people vote against their own interests. Their words are used to disguise: 'liberate a country by destroying it.' `The lies about those nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were promptly replaced by lies about phantom hordes of terrorists preparing to overthrow the US.' To protect national security, the Patriot Act makes it possible for government agents to break into anyone's house, to oblige librarians to tell what books you have withdrawn, to collect your credit reports without judicial approval!  But his main worry is ballot fraud. The owners of the three computer companies making voting machines are Republicans. At various points between the touch of the screen and the counting of the votes, the vote can be reversed. Only employees of the manufactures can take a look inside the machines in order `to protect trade secrets'. There was no paper trail in the 2004 elections and there were inexplicable swings between the exit polls and the ultimate results.  Unlike the US government, Gore Vidal doesn't have to `Rectify his language'. His message is loud and clear and should be read by all those interested in the future of the US and mankind. We need his voice. 
 This book by the Artemis Fowl author is a funny study of a kid who has always known he was a detective since the day he fingered the diaper-bound swiper of a shiny bauble in day-care. This adventure is silly but fun; his disguise is surprisingly (and disturbingly to him) successful, as he passes for the local delinquent. An ineresting study of British kids with curious twists and turns 
 Madeleine L'Engle captured my heart when I first read "A Wrinkle in Time" as a child.  I read this to my children, they read it themselves, and are now reading it to their children.  We count this book as a favorite gift for friends, children and adult alike.   Meg, the twins and Charles Wallace hold a special place in our hearts.   Thank you, Madeleine L'Engle for sharing your brilliance with us 
 Great accompaniment for the Lego kit. 
 As other reviewers have said, this is written for the layman.  Maps the flipping process out and tells you how to do it in easy to understand language.  A great starter book.  Covers what to look for, working with an R.E. agent, appraisals, foreclosures, purchasing for cash(and how to get it), using private morgage lenders(the hard stuff!),negotiating, inspection, renovation, hiring contractors, and how to sell quickly for top dollar.  The final chapter delves into some more advanced strategies.  I'm just now getting into "flipping" books and this is one of the best 
 This book is very inspirational.  It is a story of CW Nicol's karate training and every time I read it, it re-inspires me to train.  If you ever find a copy, grab it 
 Those that lament the passing of some of the very best qualities that made England a great country will find solace in Roger Scruton's wonderfully written book. Of course nothing stays the same, though sometimes we might wish it to. I think that readers who are English and who were born around the middle of the twentieth century will find this book particularly poignant, and, in some ways, incredibly sad 
 I first purchased "Legacy" by Jon Faddis several months ago, and haven't tired of listening to it since.  I am a huge fan of his, and have most of his CD collection. This CD really shows Faddis' versatility with the trumpet because of his incredible knack for imitating other famous trumpet players.  Faddis truly practices what he preaches on this album because if you have ever met him, you know that he emphasizes returning to the roots of jazz, and discovering the licks that Charlie Parker and Louis Armstrong used to play on their insturments.  This album truly displays that not only can he play their licks, he can imitate their sounds as well 
 Murray and Kraybill have produced a comprehensive book that examines Church Planting from a very balanced perspective. Their treatment of the objections to church planting is extremely valuable. Although their efforts to stay balanced cause the book to occasionally "bog down," the net effect is a classic work that will stand the test of time. This book will be a helpful guide for the leaders and participants in any church planting movement 
 This book covers everything anyone contemplating bariatric surgery needs to be aware of. The advice for deciding if you are a good candidate for surgery and for what type covers almost every question you might raise. The realistic discussion in the sections of what happens after the surgery make for realistic expectations. Anyone contemplating weight loss surgery should read this book first 
 There is no need to have a previous knowledge of operating system concepts to use this book, as stated in Amazon's synopsis. Also, the book is more  than 800 pages long, with a 70 page command dictionary and a glossary, not  the stated 400 pages. This is the ONLY textbook, written by teachers, for a  UNIX book on the market 
 Hmmmm... so this is the comic of a movie of a book? Actually it works pretty well, bringing together Philip K. Dick's strange story of narcotic paranoia with Richard Linkletter's unique cinematic vision. A federal agent (or is he?) must discover who is flooding the streets with the dangerous drug Substance D. We follow a bumbling band of hallucinating addicts and morally bankrupt agents that are chasing them in one of Dick's darkest and most autobiographical tales. The artwork is well drawn using vivid colors to enhance the story. Fans of comics or of quirky tales will find a lot to enjoy here 
      This Jane Austen novel is a favorite, and the film version is great 
 This is my first Elizabeth George story and it's a stunner. I listened to the abridged CD version so apparently missed a lot but it sure didn't seem like it. Even without a background for the main characters, the Lynley tragedy was overwhelming. I will have to go back and start with book one of the series and do hope the murders are not as gruesome as in this book 
 I love watching Devine Design with Candice Olson and right after found out about her book, ordered it right away, it's awesome book with great pictures for ideas for you own  home, the style of writing makes reading pleasan 
 This is a fascinating, and quite marvellous, documentary film. A black-and-white silent, with music and incredible arctic footage. It is a touching following of an Inuit family, revealing more than any written account could possibly relate. Not only is it perfect for classes, or the interested, but it's also just plain fun at times - I learned how to build an igloo in under an hour, and that it IS possible to fit seven people and two dogs into a single seal-skin kayak! Great fun 
 I never heard of Scotty Anderson before I got an email about it. This is one hell of a great instrumental album. It's country, country jazz, jazz, it a combination of all. This guy is the kind of player who fused together many styles and created something new. This is an album that many will play over and over and over again. Unfortunately when an album like this comes around record shops have a hard time clasifing it. On the album it says file under country and pop instrumental and it may be lost in the crowd that way as it also should be under jazz too. Well Amazon has it! I will certainly be looking forward to hearing more from him. If YOU are a guitar player you MUST buy this album. And I'd say write his name down as if the right people hear him this guy is finally going to get the big break he deserves. And in closing, I am just going to enjoy listening - no attempt to begin to figure out how it does it 
 This is an abridged version of the original 3 volumes, but a delightful book -- both for the opinions expressed and the wonderful pomposity with which they are presented.   It's impossible not to learn about art and architecture from this book, but it also (perhaps not intentionally) makes Woody Allen's or Steve Martin's New Yorker pieces seem like downers.  The man has no humility and there is no opinion other than his,  yet somehow the clarity and vitality of his description allows you to continue reading.   I was fortunate enough to pick this up in Venice, so I was able to search out his examples of the 5 worst buildings in Venice, and similar Ruskinisms 
 Iwo Jima was the last of the really big battles in the Pacific. It was taken for two reasons:   First, the Japanese radar on the island gave the warning of coming air raids two hours before the B-29s would get to Japan, plenty of time to get the air defenses ready.   The long flight back from Japan cost a lot of American lives in the crashing of planes damaged or otherwise failing during attacks on Japan. Iwo was the only place an airstrip could be built that would take B-29s and provide maintenance and hospital services.   To get Iwo, on the other hand would cost 28,686 casualties. On the part of the Marines, Iwo cost just about one-third of all the Marines killed in the Pacific. Was it worth it? Returning B-29's that landed at Iwo held just about 30,000 airmen. While some of these would not have made it back to their bases, most wouldn't have. And we will never know how many B-29s were not shot down because the radar station was taken down.   This book is the story of one Marine platoon. It began Iwo with 41 men, received 19 replacements and after four weeks of combat came away from Iwo with the Lieutenant and ten men. From a total of 60 men, twenty were killed and thirty evacuated because of wounds. All this in 28 days. This book is the story of that Lieutenant, the uncle of the author.   Thank God for these men. Thank God again that I didn't have to go where they did 
 i think in this book kristy is selfish and just because she thousht of the baby sitters club she is being stuck up .but still i like it sort of 
 I've  made >20 visits to France all together.  Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the Metro.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide   
 Mario Vargas LLosa is Peru's most well- known novelist and a writer of international reputation. Editor and translator John King brings together a rich sample of his non- fictional work. Much of the writing has to do with Politics and Literature, but there are also personal explorations as in his long essay on the period in which his younger son became a Rastafarian. There are also essays on film (Bunel ) on art(Botero)Many of the essays have to do with writers Sartre, Faulkner, Camus , Dos Passos, who Llosa feels in some way close to. He also in this work writes an illuminating essay on Isiah Berlin in which he shows how Berlin makes Ideas the main character of his essays, and how in a brilliant technical fashion Berlin by seeing these ideas from all points-of- view manages nonetheless to convey his own liberal political perspective. In the political realm there is a scathing essay on the myth of Che Guevera, an essay which faults him for the brand of revolutionary socialist violence which went nowhere- but nonetheless shows admiration for Che's having lived by the principles he preached.  LLosa writes of himself as one consumed by reading and writing, one who is on fire for Literature. And in his peripatetic and rich career in Madrid, Paris, London, and Lima LLosa has created a body of work of which this volume in so clearly enunciating his literary and political credo, must have an honorable place. ) 
 Digital photographers don't pay enough attention to color management. This book is exactly what is needed to remedy that lack.  You'll find all the basics here, and enough in-depth information to start you on the road to calibrating and fine-tuning   your digital equipment to accurately reproduce the colors you see 
 My first encounter with Friedrich was reading "Beyond Good and Evil." Being from a religious background, I had somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction to what I thought was a destructive and hateful philosophy. Nevertheless, something about Nietzsche fascinated me and I proceeded to investigate further. An avid Nietzsche fan recommended this book. My first reaction to any book that claims to know what someone else was really saying is skepticism. But, I bought the book anyway, and I came away from it with a much different opinion of Herr Nietzsche. While I don't agree with all his views, I can now see this man's brilliance and insight into the human condition. They say that Nietzsche is the most misunderstood of all philosophers. For me at least, this book helped diminish that misunderstanding 
 I've only used mine twice, and had good experiences both times.  The food turned out the way it was supposed to, clean up is easy.  It takes little effort to disassemble the fryer, but although many parts are dishwasher safe, they take up quite a bit of space in my average sized dishwasher, so I just wash everything by hand.    I wish the fry basket were larger, though I guess the rest of the appliance would have to be bigger, so I guess I wish the whole thing were just a bit bigger, but it's still a good size for the price.  I wish both the thermostat ant the timer were digital.  The timer is an egg timer type dial, and the thermostat is a slider, amking for somewhat impercise settings, though this is relatively minor.  It's still a very good deep fryer 
 I used this book when I started to play.  I have to say I learned a lot on the differences between lofts of clubs, rules and different balls to use.  It really helped me when I didn't have a clue about golf.  It explains good fundamental technique about the grip that was helpful.  However, as I got better I read some other books on golf technique that really didn't help until this one called---"The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better" by Patrick Leonardi, ISBN---1933023090.  Leonardi's book is so simple to follow and the technique described in this book is like no other book on golf instruction.  It helped me to hit longer drives and hit more fairways.  It even helped me to chip closer to the hole which made saving par much easier. Now when I play golf it is much more fun and I'm improving at a very fast pace 
 Don't read any of the following reviews unless you've already read Kenilworth.  Scott deliberately withholds from the reader key facts (facts which all of the following reviews reveal) until well after the plot has started.  Anyway, I've been on a Sir Walter Scott binge recently and, of the three Scott novels I've read -- Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward and this -- I'd place this book well above Ivanhoe but equal to Quentin Durward. It takes place in Elizabethan England; it has some sword fights; it's fairly funny in parts; the plot creaks only occasionally.  Still, well worth reading 
 This is the version I remember from the 70's, I believe this was Lesley Warren's first movie 
 Stargate is probably the greatest Sci-Fi show out there to this date, unlike other shows it doesnt rely on big effects to achieve its stories.Its a human show wich shows us people of our century in amazing situations and how they cope with them.Its not a group of people from the very distant future with other values. Its set on our time and that is what it makes it really cool to wach.The first season has great episodes for a first season, but like all it only introduces some things that in later seasons will be revealed and believe me its worth it. Stargate SG-1 is a must have to any Sci-Fi fan and its 10 season only shows you the hit this show has become 
 Just great! Starting from the history, the materials, the tools, the process... it covers everything.  It's an amazing job!  If you are planning to build some traditional boats -and kayaks in special- start by here... you will find hours and hours of fun and great building, with all the info you need 
 Just like Tom Sawyer, I could not put this book down.  Mark Twain was a wonderful story teller and a true attribute to American literature.  What more can be said about this book that hasn't already been said?  Everyone must read this American classic 
 As an avid Floyd fan since the early 70s it was particularly enjoyable to hear how the band formed, developed, and folded from an insider's point of view. Well written, unbiased and a great read 
 Sheingate's path-breaking study into agricultural subsidies is not just for farmers. Anyone interested in how policy is made, the role of interest groups, and the moderation of American politics should read Sheingate's incisive and accessible book. Perfect for the classroom, and those who miss it 
 This book was shipped to us in a very short period of time.  We were very pleased with this purchase 
 This is one of the best Nora Roberts book I've read.  There was a pretty good twist in the end that I didn't see coming.  There were no parts that I thought was slow-reading.  I was pulled in throughout the whole book and I didn't put it down until I was finished. 
 As a newcomer to watercolor painting, I have purchased an extensive library of books on the subject to better educate myself in this wonderful media. I stumbled upon "Charles Reid's Watercolor Secrets" at a bookstore and it is my favorite of all the books I've seen. It is a beautifully printed book and his paintings are extraordinary, I am just blown away by his consummate skill as an artist.His use of color and negative space(white paper) are remarkable.A wide range of subjects are covered, landscapes, flowers, French Villas and towns etc.  What really sets him apart however,are his watercolor portraits, just amazing. He seems to capture not just a likeness of the person but also their very essence. I love the painting of actor Gene Wilder though all the others are outstanding too. I loved his portrait work so much I also purchased his book on the subject "The Natural Way to Paint". So many books on watercolor look the same, overdone subjects, overly tight painting. Charles Reid is the real deal, a true artist.Very inspiring, makes me want to paint every time I look at it 
 This is one of the few comedies on TV right now that is not only hilarious, but will make you made, sad or frustrated all in one half-hour show.  It has some of the best writing and the pairing of a situation with the soundtrack is brilliant.  It pull the situation together and really makes you understand how the character is feeling.  Not only that but I've found a lot of the new music I listen to these days from songs I heard on Scrubs.  It's the best dramatic comedy on TV today and it by far has the best music 
 Very good flavor and consistency, but best of all, a very good formula that you can actually feel the difference between consuming it or not 
 I love puzzles and this is one of the greatest word game books I have ever read.  Lighthearted and fun it still proved challenging.  The answers are basic and obvious but somehow often elude the reader.  When I could not figure one out and had to look at the answer it was always followed with a groan as I realized that I had overlooked the obvious.  A great gift idea that the whole family will enjoy, I highly recommend this book 
   I came home from kindergarten every day and watched Julia while I had my cookies and milk; when this book came out my mother and I started cooking in earnest from it. Julia wrote this just for people taking the first serious plunge into the kitchen and you will need other cookbooks, but this one taught me several good things.  First, the basics of serious cooking at the age of ten. Second, how to read instructions and follow them. I have overhauled tractor engines because Julia Child taught me basic cooking as a small child. It's a lot of the same critical thinking and ability to read an instruction manual. It's still a simple enough cook book though.   So that's where this book really shines, as a great start for novice cooks and a good reference for a lot of classic recipes. I still think it's good for the kids too. Mine are experimenting with it at ages ten and twelve. Why waste time on underpowered kiddy cookbooks when a pared down classic will do the job so much better? I still grab it for quick and easy dinner and I highly recommend it for anyone taking the first plunge into the kitchen. 
 Janov writes a compelling and extremely readable account of the new paradigm in psychology that he innovated, Primal Therapy. This is one of the seminal works in Psychology;  it is very important and I highly recommend it 
 If you have sinus problems or are sensitive to light you will love this.  Even without freezing or refrigerating it offers a nice cooling effect when you put it on.  
 I found this book to be a good summary of what is out there and what the issues are with eating it. I definitely learned more about the marketing that goes on for the foods and what to watch out for with labelling. Was a little disappointed that there were not more positive suggestions for what you should eat. 
 mr pallotta's alphabet books are huge hits with both my kids, my son (who is not yet reading on his own) especially.  he is fascinated with all the information in each of the books.  if anything, they sparked his interest in reading after i had (almost) given up 
 This album is just amazing. I can't put into words how beautifully written every single song is. Normally, when I buy any album, i only like maybe 4 songs, but this album is fantastic from the beginning to the very end. Jason Wade's voice is so captivating, and the lyrics grab your attention because you can truly relate to them. There isn't any wishy- washy, whiny music here, but an album completely saturated with substance 
 What an excellent musical!  It's really a lot different from what a lot of people are doing today.  Although it hinges on an almost nonexistant plot, the episodes are excellently thought out and sensitively written.  The lyrics are simply hillarious, not only because they make you feel really ackward, but also because they touch on situations that everyone has experienced in one form or another.  I highly recommend this gem 
 It has been awhile since I read this book, but I remember it being an enjoyable read.  
 I bought this after watching an interview with Kathleen M. Cox. Found this book simple to follow and practical. Also highly recomended for those who always wonder in the scientific reason behind certain things. I highly recommend to all 
 a good book for any one fighting the dilemma of conciousness spiritual awakening,how do they differ,etc Also very good learning experience about the historys great like Jesus and Budh 
 GARGOYLE should be required reading for every creative writing class. This work sparkles with literary elegance and discipline, bubbles with sex and boils with blood. BUY IT! You will feel these writers breathing on your  neck deep into the night 
 I was given this book by a friend who highly recommended it and I was pleasantly surprised. THis book gives you the tools to help manage your personal IBS. It explains clearly how IBS is different in every body. What I appreciated most was the friendly tone. I felt like this author was holding my hand throughout...something you typically don't find in books written by doctors. The lower fat recipes for favorite foods were wonderful. I can actually enjoy fettucine alfredo again! Now I'm going to recommend this book to all the people I know with IBS 
 I found this book to be very helpful and well- thought-out. The author has provided an extremely powerful tool. He has thoroughly covered practically every situation a commercial artist is likely to face. This book contains  21 complete tear-out forms appropriately prepared for specific business  matters such as estimates, collaboration, illustrator-agent agreement,  consignment and sale of artwork just to name a few. This new revised  edition conveniently includes forms on a CD-ROM. It also includes a  detailed explanation on how to use each form. The legal advice found in  this book will surely save you a great deal of time and money which is  invaluable to any working artist. Unless you are a ''starving artist'' who  works for food only, this informative legal guide will no doubt prove  itself very useful and effifcient. This is truly an essential book for  commercial artists 
 The product was as described.  I just didn't realize that I was ordering from an exclusive chocolate store in New York city!  The candies were $2.50 and the shipping was four times that much! (I had it mailed to a U.S. address, not my address in Brazil,in case you're wondering. 
 The trio of The Crow films (yes, I enjoyed The Crow City Of Angels much as I enjoyed the first and the third) are unique by their own right, using brilliant cinematography to edge out the difference between them: The first, black and white homage to the graphic novels, with little pints of color; The second, sickly-greenish colors but somewhat interesting, as it shows us an ill-ridden type of a city much needing an angel guarding it; and the lively-yet-dark third movie, to show us real life tale of cruel justice gone bad. In each tale, The Crow is adapted quickly to his poor circumstances and finds his strength in the one true link to his former love (In the second, its the one true pure soul left in the city, Sarah), and badder-than-ever villains. Brandon Lee's performance will become (if not already) legendary, and I refer to his DVD interview to emphasis its greatness ("because we do not know when we will die, we think of life as an inexhaustable well" will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it). These three are classics, not to be confused with the fourth, which has less impact, since it tries too hard to be original, yet looses something along the way in terms of casting, acting, and cinematography, as the desert-themed atmosphere hasn't worked that well. Should have used more of that "grittier" feel to the scenes (like the four horsemen's introduction scenes), if you ask me. Having read Poppy Z. Brite's "The Crow: The Lazarus Heart", I found it more suitable for an on-screen adaptation, and thinking of it as taking The Crow in more nastier ways than ever before. But by using the first three films success in doing a B-rated sequels, it will take a miracle for these movies from becoming a laughing-stock 
 Ask a King fan what book is his best, and you will most likely hear "It" or "The Stand" as the answer. Maybe the occasional "The Shining", or you may have asked a Dark Tower fan who puts those books above and beyond the rest of the canon.  As for me, I'd simply say "Bag of Bones". I've read almost everything King's done, and a lot of it is great. Really great. He's easily my favorite author, but in my opinion nothing he's written has topped Bag of Bones.  I don't want to say much about the story, as you really need to just experience it yourself, but it is poignant, scary, and somehow awe-inspiringly beautiful.  Read it. You won't be disappointed. Then read his new one, Lisey's Story, which is in more than one way a kind of "mirror piece" when compared to Bag of Bones. By the way, I actually think I read once that King himself believes Bag of Bones to be his best. If so, he and I agree 
 Once in a while, not often enough unfortunately, I buy a cd just because I like one or maybe two of the tracks, not expecting the rest to be anything but filler and get a joyous surprise instead.  Getting this album is one example of that.    Not only is every single track a great example of good song composition and great playing, the mix and sound engineered quality of this cd is just fantastic!  Let's just say the way this one was produced, there would be no need for any remastered version to be released anytime soon.    I remember how sceptical I was before I got this album as I always remembered Ambrosia best from their hit "The Biggest Part of Me" which I liked but always felt that it was a rip-off or just too close-sounding to Earth, Wind and Fire's "That's the Way of the World" and being a big fan of EW&F, I took it as a personal insult for a long time.    Once I discovered that Ambrosia also wrote "How Much I Feel", I decided to grab the first compilation album of their greatest hits I could find.  I'm so grateful that this was the one I found in the store and at a really low price as well.  The rest is history as this cd never left my Discman for months afterwards.    The songwriting is exceptional, the musicianship is first-rate (being a musician myself, this is extremely important to me)and the sound production is excellent (being an audiophile, good production is also very important to me).    How can you tell if a greatest hits compilation is good?  If when you play the whole album, there is a continuity and it sounds as if it is not a compilation.  Very few albums fit this category (The Little River Band's original best of compilation, Naked Eyes'original compilation are a couple that come to mind)but this Ambrosia album is definitely one of them.  Go get a copy and be pleasantly surprised yourself 
 I think that this is a book that I owned when my daughter was very small (I've lost that copy) , but the cover is different. It was amazing because the pictures actually showed the seperate strands of the braid in different colors, making it so easy to follow. I am now teaching beauty school.  I went to do braiding the other day and have completely forgotten how to do all the fancy ones.  I wish that when it showed the "Look Inside This Book,"  it actually showed a page that had braiding instructions on it so that I could see if it's the same one.  Well, I just ordered it...so wish me luck.  :)  I'll let you know 
 The authors of this book advise their readers to throw out the book on mass marketing because customers today want to be treated like individuals.  In order for a company to achieve this, the authors present a concept known as one-to-one marketing.  This book is offered as the complete toolkit for implementing a one to one marketing program.  Some of the key steps in this program include:  	Identifying customers and collect as much information as possible 	Differentiate customer needs 	Interacting and customizing is critical, specifically to learn the needs of the most valuable customers. 	Change your infrastructure and be prepared to start small and expand gradually. 	Develop a marketing database because the more customer information available, the more employees will want access to that information. 	Marketing communications are important.  A company must learn to build technology and personality into the company's call center. 	Automate the sales system. 	Factor channel partners into the company's one-to-one game plan.  This one-to-one marketing program can not be implemented alone.  The authors foresee resistance to this program but offer some keen advice on how to deal with resistance and overcome obstacles.  As the authors see it, success will take time as the one-to-one relationships build.  They argue the time to build is now 
 Ever noticed that God is invisible?   Philip Yancy in his typical "I'm on this journey too" style talks about what it is really like to be in relationship with God. He likens it to real life relationships, with Parents, Children and other adult friends. There are times of closeness and times things people feel more distant. Times for us to learn and grow up, and times when we help others grow.   The thing I like most of about the book is his emphasis of "keeping it real". Many people feel their faith, and relationship with God is inadequate or substandard. But really it is quite normal, and part of having a relationship with and invisible God

 excellent excellent play. Lorriane Hansberry is uber-intelligent and moving in this debut play. very powerful. very real..deals with lots of issues..and blows you away with its frankness 
 In six well-researched and -written essays, Dr Sowell challenges both conventional and emerging feelings on social relations in the US.  He tackles both white guilt and black resentment.  His central point is that blacks in the US may have had a tough time in this country, but other ethnic groups across the world have had comparable problems and that the black community's future well-being is in their own hands.  "Black Rednecks and White Liberals" sets the tone for the rest of the book.  In it, he details how the failed mainstream black subculture derived from a failed frontier Scots-Irish culture that came from the English-Scottish border and Northern Ireland to the southern US in the 18th Century.  Other reviewers have argued whether or not the Scots-Irish culture was really a failed one, but I could easily recognize in my own Southern background many of the traits Dr Sowell mentions.  Despite that argument, the bottom line is that this culture has been around for a long time, and the dominant culture has always looked down on it, no matter the skin color of its members.  This was true when Southern whites immigrated to the Midwest in the mid-20th Century and when Southern blacks made the same move a few years later.  In fact, you can see that attitude today when you observe how Hollywood heaps scorn on "hillbillies;" the one ethnic group everyone's still allowed to pick on.  Instead of accepting that culture as "valid" or "authentic," the black community needs to adapt their culture to the more dominant one.  That means respecting education, rejecting promiscuity, and valuing industriousness.  "Are Jews Generic?" explores the concept of economic middlemen minorities.  These fringe entrepreneurs are ethnically distinct from the larger culture, but thrive because of their initiative, contacts, and skills.  Influential middlemen minorities include Chinese in south Asia, Lebanese in west Africa, Koreans in the US, as well as Jews in Europe and North America.  Their success frequently results in resentment from the larger community, especially among segments who feel exploited by the middleman minority, yet were either unwilling or unable to stake the middlemen's risks.  Andrew Young's recent comments about Arab and Korean shopkeepers serve as an excellent illustration.  Because of their greater assumed risk and proportionately higher overhead, small merchants will almost always charge more than a "big box" retailer.  Yet they meet a need that is otherwise unmet, mostly because they recognize a need and are willing to make the extra effort.  "The Real History of Slavery" is probably the most controversial essay in the collection.  Slavery is now so abhorrent to enlightened Western thought that we find it hard to realize that the philosophical objection to slavery is barely 200 years old.  As a case in point, my Bible study group was studying the Book of Exodus, and many people just couldn't comprehend why the Bible discussed how to treat slaves instead of commanding manumission.  As Dr Sowell points out, slavery has been a part of every society in human history, and still exists today.  In those cultures, slavery is one of those natural events that can happen to people; and, because one's lot in life is fixed, one has no recourse.  The Enlightenment created the conditions for a mass movement against slavery so strong that the West took military action to end it.  Yet the history of slavery in the US has a racial aspect mostly unseen elsewhere.  Why?   According to the essay, the "natural" inferiority of blacks was offered by antebellum white Southerners to justify slavery in light of philosophical objection and economic unfeasibility (historical inevitability also comes to mind, but that phrase is far too Marxist).  Our biggest problem with the history of slavery is dealing with that history.  Unfortunately, we tend to assign modern sensibilities to our forefathers.  For example, the Founding Fathers recognized the inherent disconnect between the Declaration and the existence of slavery, but also knew that insisting on a slave-free US in the 1780s would have resulted in no US.  With politics being the art of the possible, their compromise was probably the best they could have done at the time.  While it's easy to use 20/20 hindsight, our ancestors seem to have done the best they could with the hand they were dealt.  "Germans and History" discusses the spread of German culture and raises the root question of overall German complicity in the Holocaust.  Dr Sowell points out their industriousness, and how in many cultures they acted as a middleman minority.  He also points out how narrowly Hitler was elected in 1933, and lets one infer that the German people were not guilty of the rise of the Nazi dictatorship and its following evils.   I had a lot of problem with this thesis.  As examined in other books (notably Hitler's Willing Executioners), the German population was generally aware of Hitler's intent toward the Jews (and others) and, if not totally supportive of the Final Solution, at a minimum didn't object too strongly.  Many Germans, notably Dietrich Bonhoeffer, took a stand against Nazism.  Yet most of the people in 1930s Germany seem to have sold their birthright for economic stability and to avenge the Treaty of Versailles.  It's sad how thin the veneer of "civilization" can seem sometimes.  Dr Sowell examines education in "Black Education: Achievements, Myths and Tragedies."  He points out that blacks who received a secondary education 100 years ago received a much better one than they do today.  While definitely not advocating segregated education, Dr Sowell emphasizes that those students attended all-black schools with black teachers.  In my opinion, many of the problems Dr Sowell describes in the black education today apply to US education in general.  The idea that everyone must have a minimal education places a premium on the certificate instead of the education, forcing many to look for shortcuts.  It's also difficult to increase quantity and expect the quality to remain unchanged.  Additionally, the entitlement mentality has infested education.  Look no farther than Harvard, where students now agitate for a minimal "B" average since their acceptance into Harvard is a major accomplishment alone.  Unfortunately, too many Americans have entrusted education to "experts" who emphasize form over function, as well as allowing our educational system to be dominated by a labor union more interested in padding membership rolls and political agitation than the product of their business.  "History vs. Visions" presents a superb culmination to the book.  History's main value is its ability to teach us lessons for the future.  Cherry-picking historical events and subsequently misinterpreting them, turns history into a fiction designed to prove an already-decided conclusion.  We cannot condemn our predecessors for fictionalizing the past for their own purposes (George Washington and the cherry tree) when we are willing to do the same for our more "politically correct" goals (Christopher Columbus brutally invading Paradise).  We have enough fiction in the libraries; history should focus on facts, pleasant or not.  Dr Sowell has written a complex, but very readable book.  Read it and be prepared to be intellectually challenged 
 Reading Frankenstein and thinking it would be like the movies in Hollywood is totally wrong. When reading Frankenstein in the beginning it is somewhat slow but turns gruesome. People get killed even in their innocents. The monster is truly evil, not nice. Middle of the book becomes interesting but you feel sorrow and some sympathy for the monster. In the end the monster himself reveals the complete truth of what he is. This may sound like a book report but feelings cannot capture the feeling that erupts inside during the novel.  If you look at the novel from a critique point of view it is a horror but still spellbinding. The story is not just simple and scary but helps you understand the nature of emotions and the beast inside our hearts. Love and wanting of acceptance is an emotion that is not understood easily but this book uncovers the secrecy on how one is wanting to be accepted in society.   For the people who like books of horror but no meaning this book is okay. People who want a true classic but be mystified by a monster that is untaimable this is an excellent book. If you are looking for a sweet feminine or just a normal novel this might not fit you. This novel in my opinion is a true classic and you can tie it to todays world easily even though this was written over 100 years ago

 This is a beautiful book that contains many wonderful ideas aimed at people who are "coordinating" their own wedding.  It offers many different and simple solutions that not only cost less than traditional methods, but look beautiful as well.  My only complaint is that the book is sectioned out by ceremony/reception location and if your location is not among those listed, it requires you to cross-reference to other sections to find ideas that would work.  Also, the website that you are sent to for more information not listed in the back is not helpful 
 this is a very good compileation of classic alt/rock artists to relitivley new people, all with very good songs. many exclusive/new tracks, that if you are a fan of the band you definatly want to get. (i got it for 'favorite son' and ended up loving all of it). also sends out the message of punkvoter.com and against the criminal/ingornat bush administration. comes with a dvd that includes some great music vidoes, very hilarious comedy bits(by will fereal, greg proops, and patton oswalt), and informative political shorts. highly recomend it if you are pro-peace, anti-bush, a punk music lover, or all of the above. 
 This book is important, and maybe even vital, in spite of itself. Lomax is the real thing: He knows his material incredibly well, and even his most offhand paragraphs on anything at all related to African influences on American/southern culture are right on the mark. His field recordings were/are an incalculable contribution to American music. Some of them brought major artists -- Muddy Waters being the most obvious example -- from total obscurity squarely into the mainstream. He was a true scholar, and a kind of cultural hero. That said, this memoir/history was not exactly a joy to read. Lomax has a terrible weakness for lyrical language, but he just doesn't have the chops as a writer; his story is so good he should have been as plain in the telling as possible. His overheated romance with the black American male is often embarrassing. Maybe the best part of the book is a long passage when he simply gets out of the way and we hear directly from one of his subjects for many pages.  It's not that Lomax had no right to do a book like this -- he had every right to. And even at its most purple, what he has to say is crucial if you want to understand American music. I just wish he could have spared us some of his attempts at heightened language and overwrought description. Complaining about white rock musicians, he writes, "To my jaundiced Southern ears .. many rock guitarists are more concerned with showing how many notes they can get off and how many chords they  know tan what the song has to say or how the guitar can speak for them." I would say something very similar about the way Lomax wrote this book -- he should have been less concerned about how  many phrases he could get off and how many words he knew, and just let his wonderful story tell itself plainly 
 Meeting Mr Pony is the first episode I ever saw when I was like err..9 or 10. I was hooked. I can't wait for this season. The best season. Total insanity: Brenda and Kelly wearing the same horrid dress, Scott shooting himself, Brenda's perfect bangs and Steve's ridiculous hair (well, its ridiculous every season but..) 
 I received two offers shortly after reading and applying "Ask the Headhunter: Reinventing the Interview to Win the Job" after being unable to find high tech work for about two years. Enough said 
 Ace Cannon was -- and still is (see acecannon.com) -- the godfather of the saxophone.  His funky, gritty style of honking influenced not only generations of similar saxophone stylists but also arguably the whole seamy side of rock 'n roll -- everyone from Questionmark & The Mysterians to George Thorogood (i.e. the anti-Debby Boone orientation).    This compilation sounds a little too clean & stereo (one wonders if it's all re-recordings like the similar Bill Black Combo comp on Hi) but it's still a good budget-priced introduction to a living legend 
 Tim O'Brien has a corner on the market of tough-guy Vietnam vet lit. From "The Things They Carried" to "In the Lake of the Woods" and much of his other work, post-Vietnam misunderstanding, bitterness and regret are recurring themes. While "July, July" is not specifically about that tragic war, Vietnam is central to the themes of a thirty year reunion looking back on the events of the late 1960's and forward. We encounter the lives of several disparate individuals whose lives intersect and deviate from one another. None of these have been spared unhappiness or hardship. From the class clown, to the popular girl, to the popular guy, the radical, the mature go-ahead type, the obese schlub, and so on, we get a broad cross-section of the class of '69 from this typical Minnesota school.   The one criticism I have is that at times it felt like O'Brien was painting some of his characters with broad strokes, and this tended to create single-layered characterizations, rather than multi-dimensional characters. Some of the couplings that developed between the characters did not seem believable. The book could have been 200 pages longer and it wouldn't have suffered from it. Other than that, it was very entertaining, imaginative, and passionate. I find that O'Brien writes most convincingly when he transports us to the swamps of Vietnam, and it was true here. A good book from a skilled author. 
 This book delivered just what I was looking for. I wanted a systematic way to understand what goes into peoples' initial judgments of others. I wanted it to be substantive and based on research but not too dry or boring of a read. I definitely found that here. Additionally, Demarais and White really bring the material to life - I could easily identify many of the examples they used with situations I encounter in my life. The research they cite is fascinating and makes me feel even more inclined to try out some of the things they advise. I think this is a very well-written and intelligent book on a topic that is ususally treated in an insultingly simple-minded manner. I very highly recommend this book! 
 I am a huge fan of catchy, country-folk music with insightful lyrics. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:  1) Ghosts Of The Great Highway by Sun Kil Moon 2) Kings Avenue Joe Kile 3) Subtitulo by Josh Rouse 4) Banjos and Sunshine by Sixty Acre 
 FINALLY A NOVEL ABOUT SOUTHERN WOMEN THAT DOES NOT PAINT THEM AS DIRT EATING FOOLS! THE WRITER SHOWS THE READER TWO DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES FROM THE RURAL WORKING CLASS TO THE OLD MONEY WHEELS OF SMALL TOWN LIFE. i VERY MUCH ENJOYED THE MAIN CHARACTER, ERMA LEE, EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T SAY THAT I LIKED HER. IT IS THE MORE REFINED MISS CLAUDIA THAT WON MY HEART. I FINISHED THIS NOVEL THINKING THAT I NEED A MISS CLAUDIA IN MY OWN LIFE. THIS IS REAL LIFE (FRIENDSHIP, FAITH, HURTS AND DREAMS). A SOLID FIRST NOVEL THAT LEFT ME WANTING TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ERMA LEE 
 5 stars = duty I like it! I love it! NO doubt!! This is the GRATEST action movie!!! The story, the action, the music...everything GREAT! I'm sorry...I'don't need American action movies anymore. I can't explain why  this is so good. At first WATCH IT!!!! Thank you Great creators, actors and  actress!!! 
 I imagine in my mind what it would be like to have coffee with Luis Borges on a Sunday afternoon. Borges would be wearing a suit and have little cakes on hand, cane leaning on his armrest, as if nothing out of the ordinary were about to occur.  Labyrinths is a useful first book to kick off a lifetime investigation into Borges' writings. Borges is truly original as an author as much for his intent as for his achieving it. Not quite Magic Realist, not quite Existentialist nor Kafkan: no one is Borges' equal in taking established assumptions and turning them into curious, elaborate, eruditely-supported flashing crossroads that defy simplification.   Even the most unassuming essays like "The Fearful Sphere of Pascal," a subtle historical resketching, are characteristically erudite, yet sticky and complicate the subject irresistibly from your first reading onward. The prickly thorns reach out for your existing education on the subject and are designed to flesh out the glaring inconsistencies you will have read on the subject.  The Garden of Forking Paths is an example of prime Borges storytelling at work. The story itself is a ruse. The first reading-through is not the time you are affected most by Borges, but rather only AFTER you have put the book down, when the Borges' physics of Being begin to gnaw at your world of compact, necessary daily conveniences, even in 2005 when we really ought to be intimately familiar with his universe by now. I think ultimately Borges sets tiny mind bombs set to detonate at exactly the time you seek to superimpose a Newtonian universe upon one of his stories, and ultimately, later, when you seek to superimpose order upon your own human experience. The entrance seems the same, but it has clearly moved by the time you exit the story. You become part of the puzzle, and that is the bedazzling signature of Borges, and his unassailable virtue. Everything solid in the universe of daily lived experience becomes compost and peacefully unsettled, as it originally was, before we came along to fix it up like morticians just before the funeral. 
 This album created a movement thats been slowly evolving ever since. Comparable to Future Sound of London's 'Lifeforms' or 'Dead Cities' this journey into musical bliss is layered with beautiful yet strange samples and textures found only in a handful of electronic artists* ( *see: Future Sound of London , Boards of Canada , Aphex Twin , 2 Lone Swordsmen, Jean-Michel Jarre). As one reviewer already said this release was way ahead of its time. This album is a mix of different styles from ambient to dub to acid house which at some points is more dance oriented than strictly ambient. With almost 2 hours of music on 2 cds this might seem long but does it ever fly by. I enjoyed this album as a whole rather than just having favourite tracks. If you're into sci-fi and space exploration you deffinately need to buy this. I recommend smoking a spliff and sitting back in a lawnchair looking up at the stars and letting your subconcious take over. Its hard to believe its been 14 years since its conception . Only open minds need apply 
 Why Luna wasn't a major hit still mystifies me. But then why didn't people appreciate Big Star and The Ramones? Without a doubt one of the best rock bands ever. And now you have the opportunity to see what you missed the first time around 
 I was in no hurry to start the series until I heard about the show on the Sci Fi Channel. I bought the first book, was hooked and bought 2-8. The series keeps getting better and better, while not becoming lame or boring like a certain fantasy series.   The wife and sone are hooked. However, because I'm a fast reader and I bought the books, I get first crack, then my wife and my son comes last. :D  The wife is planning to read this book all day today. She wants to wait for White Night to come out in paperback, but I think I'm gonna get the hardcover now.   I'd love to see the last 2 books become a movie, adhering to the book, unlike the show 
 What more can be said about this book? Harris is as meticulous about the study of human behavior as his characters are about the science of criminal profiling. Yet, the science does not war with the primitive creepy crawly feeling presented by the characters. Buffalo Bool is deranged and fascinating, Hannibal Lecter is charming, captivating and something very close to genuine Evil. This is a novel that is already being studied in classrooms and that will continue for generations. But Harris won't let you forget that this is a horror novel. Learn all you want from it and glean all the insights you can handle. It will still make you feel like a five year old concerned about what might be living inside the closet across the room. -- Mark LaFlamme, author of "The Pink Room. 
 Not the easiest to read but worth the while, as most classics are. Although it's one of those books where, I would say, it really doesn't matter whether you watch the movie before or after 
 I haven't laughed so much while reading a book for a long time! This book is full of great characters that are fun to read about. I first got the recommendation to read the Stephanie Plum series a few years back from a clerk at the book store after she caught me picking out romantic suspense, but I tend to read more from the "romance genre" so I waited awhile before trying.  I've only read two in the series so far, and so far the developing relationship between Plum and Joe Morelli sure is pulling me in. This is a great book for readers who enjoy laughing, a mystery, and a bit of romance. 
 I absolutely Love all of Nicholas Sparks' books. I have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you. Get your kleenex's ready. You can't go wrong here.  And I always preorder his new ones..... I'm addicted 
 This is a sweet, but vibrant tour de force of the Gary Burton quartet sound with a guitar and bass line up. It features energy, enthusiasm and playfulness with strong performances overall. There is just a hint of wistfulness or nostalgia perhaps with a nod to Burton's Pat Metheny quartet days with their coverage of one of his tunes. The song selection is varied with samplings of blues, straight ahead jazz rhythmns, ballads, new songs and a "standard". The band is remarkably tight and the selections will grow on you 
 So Big was made into a movie four times:  1924, 1930, 1932 and the 1953 version starred Jane Wyman.  It was directed by Robert Wise who did many outstanding films including "Sound of Music."  I am a big Edna Ferber fan, am presently reading one of her collections of short stories--this one called "One Basket."  Every story is so good.  Her writing is so good--can anyone explain to me why she is not more revered as an American author.  Most of her books are love stories to America.  Her autobiographies, especially the first one, are terrific.  Her grandniece has also written a very interesting biography of Edna Ferber.  I would love to correspond with another fan of Edna Ferber.  
 This big band rendition of the best of Zawinul, Shorter & Company is an essential "Weather update." As other reviewers have opined, those 70s synth sounds have not aged well despite the fact that JZ was the consummate synth player (akin to Garth Hudson with the Band). The horns arrangements are unified and add a fresh perspective to the WR standards. Would love to hear more peformances, but these two discs' worth are nothing short of amazing. Jazz is alive and well in the 21st Century.  
 An outstanding piece of work about a very serious drug problem. This book would be helpful to addicts who wish to recover. It would also be enlightening to family members who suffer due to a loved one's addiction 
 I like this cd a lot, but only because I have been listening to this band for the past ten years and have grown to love all their music. Personally,this CD is a bit too "happy" for my taste, and wish they would get back to their earlier, "darker" sound. "I See Good Spirits & I See Bad Spirits", "Confessions Of A Knife" are better, but overall, I can't complain with Luna 
   We all know the biggies on this one...Cinnamon, Sand and River, but when I first bought this on vinyl in '69, the track that wore out first was Running Dry...The lyric, Neil's voice and playing all came together for me, punctuated by Bobbie Notkoff's hauntingly beautiful Gypsy inspired violin playing that tore a hole in my mind and heart. A sound so rich as if played on a Stradevarious by a true Romanian nomad, playing a tribute to a deceased relative.  If any song on this album deserved more time it was this one. How can anyone not be in love with this song?  It was dark, beautiful, lyrical and so on the point with everything going on in SE Asia, and here in America, it touched something deep inside me.  Bobbie Notkoff emoted the feeling of this song so very well, like Eddie Jobson's work on the first UK album, it brought  a lump to my throat and tear to my eye. To this day, only Jobson and Notkoff have done this to me on first listen.  So, by all means, buy this album for the biggies, for they are indeed that...and so much more...classics in the truest sense and rightly so, but please, above all else, buy it for at least one fair listening to Running Dry...to me, the most powerful song on this stellar collection from the man who gave us I Am A Man...and so many others...and play it loud...you owe it to yourself, and your neighbors 
 After my career as a street cop in a big city I can tell you that Wambaugh is right on target with his characters. Wambaugh's characters are not what Jack Webb would have approved, but most match people all cops come across after a few decades of street experience. His plots are entertaining with the end product being a book that I cannot set down until the last page is turned 
 This novel is packed with action from page one and literally I could not put it down. No sense in describing the content of the novel, suffice it to say that I read it in two days. I didn't view this as just a novel but an example of how strong the American Spirit can become when things get tough. The proof of this was seen on September 11, 2001. I am a Canadian citizen and the novel made me feel the American spirit to the point that I would be honored to also become an American citizen and fight for USA and what it stands for 
 This is a beautiful story about friendship, although it may be more appropriate for older children and adults. Children may not understand it's true meaning. For an adult or young adult who has to face the upcoming death of a friend or family member it is very meaningful. I cry every time I read it, but I love the story.  
 Tis is an wounderful stroy about a life in the 60s. watch this movie it will give you the sence on howhard it was to raise kids all by yoursel 
 Works great. Cooking space on grill holds a large amount of meat, fish,etc..  We would like to see a canister that holds more gas than for cooking only five meals. 
 In "The Year of the Jackpot", a statistician graphs the points of convergence  of cyclycal events.  Overlapping his graphs, he notices that the   wavy lines are approaching extremes.  Interesting times. The story "By His Bootstraps" is not logically sound: How did Bob Wilson get to the other side of the Gate so that he could operate the Gate before sending for the first version of himself? "The Menace From Earth" tackles Earth Moon female jealousy. "Sky Lift" details the heroism of a rocket pilot carying an antidote to the Pluto colony.  "Goldfish Bowl" asks: What if humans were kept as pets by disinterested intelligent beings?  "Project Nightmare" is about Psionic humans who are able to locate nuclear devices and prevent atomic  fusion -- using psi ability.  "Water is for Washing" is about a mega earthquake that creates a new sea between the Pacific Plate and the  North American Plate.  The Gulf of California extends to Los Angeles 
 Each one of these four delightful little stories is perfect for that last story you read before your toddler drifts off to sleep. For about a year not I've been making up words to go along with them, especially the first story, "What Will Little Bear Wear" but now that my son is older (a couple, three months shy of three) and knows his letters. I'm starting to stick to Ms. Minarik's story, letting Devon point out the letters, trying to convince him that they make the words he hears me say.  Devon likes all four of these Bear Tales, especially the third one, "Little Bear Goes to the Moon" but that's not surprising as he's a big, well a little, Star Wars fan as well. All the stories are good.  This is a book for beginning readers. The words are simple, grammar too. It's a cute little story, guaranteed to keep your toddler interested, so much better than the "See Spot Run" kind of early readers. If you want your child reading before Kindergarten, and I do, then this book and books like it are very good additions to your toddlers reading arsenal.  Jack Priest, Dad in Trainin 
 I have read almost of Robert A Heinlein's titles and have been so absorbed that I have reread them many times each 
 There is definitely a detective suspense thriller within the elements found in The Monkey's Mask. The development of the detective's character - the realistic portrayal of a discontent woman often sidetracked from her goal - maintains an interesting path. The appearance of Kelly McGillis, holding on to a solid cinematic presence, is a familiar and interesting addition to the cast. Several heated scenes delve more deeply into the detective's life, but they don't jump too far from the film's theme, so they're not as gratuitous as many viewers may think. Awkward moments are intended occasionally and are truly awkward. It's an odd film, but interesting viewing 
 As a long-time baseball fan who has heard all the interviews and read a lot of baseball books, I fully expected "Built To Win" to be a rah-rah, gung-ho baseball book in the spirit of the interviews that Tommy Lasorda always gives the media.  I also expected nothing resembling "inside info" that I hadn't read elsewhere.  So I was very pleasantly surprised that the book isn't at all like that.  As a 15-year Braves' season-ticket holder, I learned a lot about the organization and gained a greater respect for Schurholz and his staff.  The only negative thing I can say about it is that Schurholz repeatedly hammers the point that his philosophies are all full of goodie-two-shoes attitudes.  While that's not a bad thing . . . in fact it's quite admirable in this day of schmuck-dominated business dealings . . . it gets a little old after a while 
 I love this movie - Maureen O'Hara never looked prettier and John Wayne is his outstanding macho self.  Wayne had to complete The Quiet Man in Ireland in order to do this film and John 'Pappy' Ford made exceptionally effective use of the Monument  Valley locations.  The added bonus is the music of Stan Jones and the Sons of the Pioneers, the number one western music group of all time.  Stan (who wrote the classic "(Ghost) Riders in the Sky") wrote almost all the music, also has a speaking role, as does Ken Curtis, the Pioneers' lead singer and who later became "Festus" on Gunsmoke.  The story is a classic - a mother's love for her only son along with the anger of a spoiled southern aristocrat caught in the ravages of the Civil War, the former husband whose pledge of Duty, Honor, and Country of the career military man broke up their marriage, and the realization and acceptance by both of that pledge is as integral to the man as were her ties to the South.  This should be in the top five of John Wayne movies for collectors - great music, acting, scenery, photography, and message 
 I picked up this book at a gift shop in Belize for the waiting room of my chiropratic practice in New York.  It has attracted much attention and interest from my patients.  The book is simple to follow and brings the timeless wisdom of an ancient healing tradition into practical use.  In one case I recommended a remedy for headaches suggested by Ms. Arvigo. In conjuction with a program of chiropractic adjustments the remedy proved to be quite helpful.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in natural healing.  Bruce Schneider, D.C. New Paltz, NY   
 Scott's second novel Guy Mannering begins in the 1760s and concludes "near the end of the American war" in the early 1780s. Scott is deliberately vague about dates, as his focus in this novel is not on historical events or persons. The story begins with Guy Mannering's chance visit to Ellangowan the home of the Bertrams a noble Scottish family somewhat in decline. It is the night when Henry Bertram is born and Mannering an amateur astrologer sets out to make a chart of the boy's future. He is disturbed by the result however, and declines to reveal what he has foreseen, asking the family to wait five years before reading the prediction. Mannering leaves only to return some twenty years later to find that the fate of the Bertram family has become intimately connected with that of his own and that somehow, despite his own scepticism about his abilities as an astrologer, his predictions in an uncanny way have mirrored events.  Scott's skill as a storyteller is shown well in this novel. The story has a fast pace with lots of action and suspense. The major characters are confronted with the dangers of a lawless time, including murder, smuggling and abduction. Moreover, they must carry out their romances despite the disapproval of their parents. As is so often the case with Scott, much of the pleasure from reading the tale comes from the various minor characters he describes. Dominie Sampson is an unforgettable character hilariously awkward of speech and manner, constantly exclaiming "prodigious", but fiercely loyal to the Bertram family. Meg Merrilies, an unusually tall, mysterious gypsy fortune-teller, is likewise fascinating with her apparently supernatural ability to influence events. These and other characters, both the virtuous and the villainous, make the story continually interesting.   The best edition of Guy Mannering is that edited by P.D. Garside. This edition, based on the first edition and manuscript, provides the best possible text, restoring for the first time a large number of lost readings and indeed some quite extensive passages. It also has a full glossary, essential for understanding the Scots dialect and archaic words in the novel, and an extensive set of notes. Guy Mannering is a really enjoyable novel and good fun to read. It is also relatively straightforward and so would provide a good introduction to Scott's Waverley novels. 
 The most beautiful and inspiring nonfiction I've read.  I intern in a molecular biology lab, so the science wasn't new to me.  The story, however, was breathtaking.  I've recommended this to many people--the same goes to you, Amazon reader 
 This is book is a great primer on the basics of investing. The language does seem geared towards a younger audience, but the information presented is useful for new and would-be investors of all ages and is very easy to read (I finished it in 3 days). For me, the book was a good brush up on different investing options. Lynch weighs the pros and cons of different investments and strategies, but in the end stresses that the most earning potential at the end of the day is in stocks. The book also includes great tips and advice on how to choose strong companies with potential for growth. This book was definitely  the gentle 'shove' I needed to start investing and building a strong portfolio.   I think the book would be even better with a little updating- a bit of information or insight on the different online brokers would have been very helpful. 
 Phillips nails it. And it's coming here to a city near you 
 The book is a rapid read - you should be able to easily read in a day or two - and the authors have taken an almost conversational tone.  The most intriguing part of the book was the last third wherein the authors present two models for hybrid organizations, and make a compelling case that this is the future of the competitive landscape.  I gave it 4 stars for two reasons:  First, I would've liked to see more of the interviews and profiles of the "catalysts" of decentralized organizations; the glimpses provided were fascinating and all too brief, leaving many of my questions unanswered.  Second, the impression...and I'll admit I might be off-based...that the terrorism angle was thrown in there to heighten interest in the book and broaden its audience reach.  The authors touch upon terrorism, but their suggestions to combat / deal with it don't come close to the depth, critical thinking and breadth of their suggestions for corporations and the marketplace.  If the authors had added more of the first (the interviews and profiles) in place of the terrorism-angle, the book would be much stronger.  The terrorism angle could've then been tackled with a follow-on article, a separate chapter, a website section, etc.  That said, I still recommend the book as a welcome refreshment to so much of late on "corporate leadership. 
 This book is one great read. I rank it up there with R. McNeal, B. McLaren, and F. Viola's divergent look at the church and culture. 
 The key word in Villani's title is ART, and we've got plenty of it in Hot Springs. With over 27 non-profits directly related to the visual and performing arts, the author hits right on the money to concentrate on the Hot Springs Music Festival, held first two weeks of June every year; the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival in October, one of four preliminary sites for the Academy Awards; and 200 consecutive monthly Gallery Walks in Historic Downtown. Affordable? We think so. Refreshing? Absolutely. For more information, see www.nativecuriosity.blogspot.com 
 For a one-day snapshot in the life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne, "Saturday" covers a lot of ground.  From an unexpectedly early awakening, to a fiercely competitive game of squash, to a run-in with demented street thugs, to a family get-together gone horribly awry, to a late-night surgical procedure, Mcewan transforms the ordinary into the transcendent in a way that reminds me of Updike's best work.   Terrorism, evolutionary theory, genetic predeterminism, art, socio-economic strata, parenting, and mortality all take their turns on stage, with Mcewan's brilliant prose teasing universal truths from this utterly realistic microcosm he's created.  Seen through the eyes of a perfectly-drawn character whose profession is known for its God complexes, Perowne's realization that his Saturday is coming to a close and that he, like any mere mortal, had better prepare for the coming Sunday in his life, resonates perfectly.  For me, genre fiction is where much of today's most interesting writing can be found, yet this novel serves as proof that certain literary fiction can both entertain and enlighten.  -Kevin Joseph, author of "The Champion Maker" 
 Listening to this CD was heavenly. The way it's built up like is brilliant, kind of like a Radio Theatre performance with actual lines from the movie in between the songs. Another great thing is that all songs are in order of apperance from the movie so if you close your eyes and just listen you can actually see the movie in your mind 
 i liked this book it was very deatailed and had alot of words in it. it was a long book.  ha dude i dont even know what the book is it is proble gay po ya i am a cyberbullie ooooo 
 Remarkable introduction to several trends of literary criticism in the XX century. I had never seen something like this before. The author presents all critical trends in such a ways as to dissect their founding bases, their theoretical a priori. Bright, insightful, clear, the author, although we should know that he's a marxist by the end of the text, is not willing to push his views on us, but rather takes the opportunities to deconstruct the very founding concepts that have driven marxist analyses worldwide and through history 
 Jeez - guess I'm the contrarian here. I liked the book. Dimitrius doesn't offer up any secret method that will let you see into the minds and hearts of others but mostly she presents good common sense observation skills. What does your car say about you? What about your shoes? Why do you never offer anything in a meeting? Why do you try to control a meeting? These are all things that we have commented on in other people and Dimitrius delves further into these kinds of questions in an attempt to come up with a best bet about how someone acts or thinks. Don't expect to be the new Sherlock Holmes and rattle off a ten minute dissertation about someone after seeing the color of their tie - that's a fiction that Dimitrius try to portray. Just as interesting, I thought, was to turn the thing around. After reading the book I began to wonder how I present myself to others. What does my demeanor or posture say about me in the five seconds where I get to make a first impression?   The book is easy to read, well written, and thought provoking. 
 This was a very informative book if just a bit dated (Some of the contact information included was at the World Trade Centers in NYC). Other than that the book was very good in detailing the process for starting the business. It was paticularly good in the explanation of creating a unit price for the product addressing several areas which I had not considered. This book is written in an intellegent manor for people who have some understanding of business but need help in gaining specific industry knowledge. 
 I love the Jedi Academy Series and I love this book. I really like this book out of the series. A great way to wrap up a fantastic series.   Not much more to say, I just loved this book very much 
 Carl Honore's book explores how our lives have become so fast paced and the consequences of living a life out of time with what we truly need. Honore offers some interesting solutions on how to deaccelerate the pace of our super-busy lives and how to proceed, slowly, from a "time-poor" existence to one that is rich in taking the time to savor the journey. 
     The Best and the Brightest is an incredible read about a politically and ideologically confused America.  Halberstam makes an outstanding attempt at uncluttering the mess that was the U.S. government during the 60s.  He also demythifizes the Kennedy team; a team that was comprised of the best and the brightest our country had to offer.  Or were they?  As described by Halberstam, though many were bright, they obviously weren't the best for the job.  Even McNamara, who Halberstam glorifies for his ability to put together a sound system, seems to not be the right man for the job.  The generals, particularly Westmoreland, were caught up in their own political/career minded shenaningans, that ultimately brought them down.        Halberstam's description of the Johnson administration is just down right scary.  How any man could lead a nation such as the United States in such a foolhearty way, is unbelievable.  According to Halberstam, Johnson didn't know which way was up, and like a fool, he could only fall down.  And fall he did, like a drunk to a bar room floor.        The best part of the book is the in depth analysis of all the character's involved, and Halberstam pulls no punches.  According to the generals, the South Vietnamese were cowards.  Is that true?  Or is it more likely that they were no more eager to kill their own country men than Union/Confederate soldiers were eager to kill their own countrymen?  According to Halberstam Kennedy knew practically nothing about what was going on in South Vietnam, and worried continuously about what he was hearing.  Is that true?  All evidence as presented in the book, says it is.  According to Halberstam, the entire war effort was no more than a sham put on by virtually everybody involved.  Is that true?  I am afraid that I believe that it is.        I highly recommend this book.  I read the 20th Anniversary Edition, and I found it to be compelling and irressistable reading 
 If this is the first of the series you've picked up, rush out and get the rest!  You won't be disapointed!  If you are a diagram follower, this is a wonderful book.  Not so good on the written instructions, but the diagrams hold their own.  The biggest thing to remember is that, like most Japanese patterns, you need to use two needles to follow the action exactly.  My only complaint is that a lot of the projects rely on crystal settings...which can be hard to find, but with a little work, you can get around them 
 We love this book. Moose is so perfect for times when we want to enjoy a fun, interactive book with our 2-year-old. We have lots of favorite parts, but the best is when my son yells out "Boo!" He can hardly wait to get to that page. :) Its just a fun book. And for a girl from the midwest its full of lots of things that feel like home to me. I like getting to share that with my son. Not that he knows that's part of why i love it, being 2. Also a book full of opportunities to talk about and encourage sharing and helping and friendship... and housecleaning. :) haha. We highly recommend it. 
 This is a superb analysis of the Pacific War between the USA and Japan.  It is always very difficult for an author to strike a balance between sufficient detail on the one hand, and the risk of overwhelming the "big picture" with too much detail, on the other.  Here, the author hits it just right.  This is a detailed and thorough analysis of the Pacific War that focuses on the main trends of the war, while supplying sufficient detail to support the themes that the author presents to the reader.  Spector's basic thesis is not new, but this is the best presentation of it that I have encountered.  Essentially, the author notes that superior American industrial capacity, organizational skills, and technology overwhelmed a highly trained, well-armed and competent Japanese foe.  The Japanese training regime was brutal, featuring tough night training in the icy waters south of the Kurils--Japanese skill at night naval engagements were to give the US Navy ugly moments for years. On the other hand, the author speculates that the savage discipline of the Japanese service tended to "burn out" its officers, often causing them to avoid "thinking outside the box."   Both sides had problems with inter-service rivalries.  The Americans fought the war with divided commands, whereby MacArthur advanced through the South Pacific with most of the Army, while Nimitz advanced through the Central Pacific with the bulk of the Navy and the Marines.  The author argues that this was an inefficient, sub-optimal strategy.  The Japanese Army and Navy were even more riven with rivalries, and the Japanese Navy on numerous occasions concealed from the Army the scope of its defeats at the hands of the US Navy. (It was a long time before the Japanese Army learned of the disasterous defeat of the Navy at Midway; the Army believed that Japan had won, not lost, the Battle of Leyte Gulf).    This is a fairly conventional analysis of the Pacific War, but the author sometimes does come to unorthodox conclusions that will challenge the reader's own opinions about command decisions made by the Pacific War's heavyweights.  Frank Jack Fletcher merits heavy blame for lacking aggressiveness on several occasions, which is no surprise, but at times Admiral Spruance (a personal hero of mine) also comes in for criticisms that I did not expect.  The author overall attempts to be fair, however, and generally does a pretty fair job of making his case.  Overall, this is perhaps the best single volume analysis of the Pacific War written for the general public that I have come across, and it is highly recommended 
 I love this book- I love all things french, gardening, and cooking.  This was delightful and has been the source of many wonderful seasonal meals.  I love Hesser's style and sense of fun 
 As a Certified Fitness Trainer, I find this workout to be absolutely genius! It is a comfortable length, about a half hour, and includes a warm up for the abs that even stretches the muscles a bit to help get you prepared. The moves are very unique and target the entire core- from planks to crunches seated on the 14" Transfirmer- a tool I highly recommend. The moves are also modifiable for beginners. In the advanced positions, I think seasoned exerciers will find these creative moves to be quite challenging. Allie well cues the workout. The first two sets are begun seated on the Transfirmer in different positions to target the lower back, rectus abdominus, and oblique muscles. Then the exercises finish on the floor, shifting from one group to the next and completely fatiguing each area for maximum results. The workout ends with a satisfying stretch that loosens muscles you may think are unrelated to the abdominals- like the hip flexors and trapezius- but actually have a synergistic role in the movements. A genius workout- awesome music and excellent cueing. A favorite of mine! Kitka [... 
   If, like the rest of us, you spend most of your time pissing and moaning over the seeming unfairness and petty inconveniences of everyday life, I suggest you check out "Murderball" for an immediate attitude readjustment.  This fascinating documentary will put all of that stuff into perspective for you, while entertaining the hell out of you at the same time.  Played on a regulation-sized basketball court (minus the baskets), Murderball is actually a slang name for Wheelchair Rugby, an international sport in which quadriplegics use their specially armored wheelchairs almost like souped-up bumper cars to score goals for their team.   The film concentrates, primarily, on the intense and sometimes downright vicious rivalry between the team from the United States and the team from Canada.  The moviemakers introduce us to about a half dozen players, each of whom, even in the few moments afforded him on screen, becomes a distinct personality with a history to relate and a story to tell.  The two main focal points are the charismatic and muscular Mark Zupan, and Joe Soares, one of the legendary pioneers of the sport who left to coach for Canada after he was cut from the American team.  Many of the most incisive scenes deal with the ribbing, some of it good-natured, some of it not so good-natured, that Soares has had to endure over his decision to defect to the opposing side.    Although the rugby scenes themselves are gripping and thrilling, the real drama occurs off the court in the men`s personal lives, as we see the struggle and heartbreak the men go through, the strength and inspiration they exhibit for the rest of us, and, most especially, the camaraderie and team spirit that comes with working together to achieve a common goal.  As the filmmaking crew follows the men around through the course of their daily lives, we get to know them as complex individuals, finding out how they ended up in a wheelchair and seeing how each was able to rise above the experience to get to where he is today.  The film neither sugarcoats the difficulties of their lives nor asks for our pity.  It simply presents the men to us, in all their virtues and flaws, and asks that we listen in on their stories.  Some of the most poignant moments involve Soares having to come to terms with having a son who has little or no interest in sports, preferring the violin instead.    Kudos to directors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro for their fine work on this film, especially Rubin, who also provided the stunning camerawork for the scenes on the court.  But most of our thanks should go to the men of the film and their loved ones who were willing to open up their lives to us in so vivid and honest a way.   This is an inspiring and heartwarming film - the final scene is of some of the men introducing the sport to a number of injured Iraq War veterans - that will stick with you long after the closing credits 
 I am a graduate student in Analytical Chemistry. This book has been a great resource when I need to look up a speceific topic. I like the fact that it provides references to most topics. They are a great starting point if you want to research that topic. Just look up the references, plug it into SciFinder and see who's been quoting  it a lot and then look up his/her latest book or review article on the subject ;)   Forget about this book if you want to use it as a textbook, unless you have a very good instructor who'll provide you with a good overview and pick'n'choose what parts of the book you need to be aquainted with.   I don't think this book was written to be a self-contained, 'read-it-from-beginning' & 'i'll-take-your-hand-and-guide-you-though-the-subject' type of a book. So you can't blame it for what it's not meant to be. This is the type of a book you need to pick up with an established purpose or question in your mind. Then you'll consider it to be a valuable resource. If you pick it up just as a beginning student in the field, you'll absolutely hate it with a serious passion! If you use it as I suggest, it will take an honored place in your library. I have the deepest respect for authors of this book and am very thankful for providing me with such a strong tool in my career.   Another great book I'd put in the same category is  Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds by Robert M. Silverstein, Francis X. Webster, David Kiemle (6th edition 
  Philip Noyce is a very smart filmmaker. And once more he confirms it through this intense and intriguing psychological picture around a notable expert forensic (Denzel Washington)  sadly a bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces with a witty female agent (Angelina Jollie) to intend by all their means to get a mysterious serial killer around the low belly of NYC.  Smart clues, notable shots, first rate direction, kinetic script make of this movie one of the five most solid thrillers in the Nineties according the tradition of Silence of the lambs as well as an underneath homage to "The rear window", if you carefully establish the visible connections, due if James Stewart was a visible peeping tom at those times, Denzel Washington is the scrutinizing cyber eye. The paradigm remains, and just the form changes.   Highly recommended.  
 This is one of the finest productions I have ever seen..Too bad more aren't being produced 
 This is a great set. Eyepieces are high qualiity. Case is very durable as well. I have not played with the filters yet, but they screw easily into any eyepiece. For $60.00, you can not go wrong. Amazon is a great place to save on this item

 Excellent analysis regarding the troubles that plague the nursing profession. Problem is - how to fix it? I'm not sure we nurses can tolerate the poor working conditions much longer.. 
 Within recent years I had become distraught with associating myself with the Christian religion; it began to seem incompatible with the truths that were revealed in a postmodern perspective. I was conflicted with how an organized religion could remain standing in the presence of my relativistic thought and skepticism of objective exegesis.  Peter Rollins, though, presents the possibility of living with the title of Christian without the modernistic burden of having to claim objectivity; he rather emphasizes approaching the Christian religion through an unclassifiable form of faith that is sincere to an individual's experience while still inspired by scripture. He answers the skeptics with enthusiastic approval that by asking the question, one has already found the answer - to seek God is to find Him. The search for God (Truth) is not so much a process that will provide an answer to live by but it is an approach that transforms one's life with the answer of how to live. And it seems that answer consists of a question: "God, how should I live?".  My review does no justice to the redemption of Christianity I have found in this book; it has helped cultivate and name a perspective that has been stirring inside of me with which to consider the Christian faith tradition. The book has by no means answered all of my uncertainty nor given me a clear direction of how to go about living. But it has encouraged a process of valuing the search and being content without the answer 
 I read this one back to back with desperation...I liked this one better though.  Both good reads 
 I have always been intimidated at the thought of preparing Thai food.  Not anymore!  This book shows you just how easy it is to prepare delicious Thai dishes - some better than you can get in Thai restaurants!  The beef salad is outstanding and the Thai Noodles are remarkably easy.  I love this cookbook!! 
 HOW TO ARGUE AND WIN EVERY TIME by Gerry Spence is a book that not only teaches a person how to argue but also how to live successfully.  The author touches on myriad subjects, particularly while explaining the application of the methods of argument.  I consider the author to be a a wise, intelligent, and generous individual who shares his insights for people to ultimately improve their lives.  The author's philisophy, I believe, in a word is Justice.      The book is not about arguing per se but living a successful life, which the author defines as blooming freely.  I think that is also Aristotle's philisophy; i.e., success is a life in which one flourishes.  I must caution the readers that if they seek to obtain a book on how to argue, this book will help but I consider it more of a philisophical treatise on living successfully.  I provide 5 stars because I find the author to be so fascinating and honest; his arguments about being your authentic self and how to work with one's family are very interesting.   Nevertheless, I think the author is, as he candidly states in the book, biased against corporations.  He correctly points out the many wrongs of corporations, particularly the Ford Pinto egregiousness that resulted in hundreds of deaths.  In teaching individuals how to argue with corporations to obtain pay raises, he correctly points out that one must link a pay raise to an increase in performance.  Further, the competent boss will already be working to obtain a pay raise for a meritorious person prior to the person having to argue for it.     In conclusion, I feel compelled to thank the author.  One, for writing such an excellent book and providing great insights.  Two, for fighting for Justice and striving to do what is right.  I found the book to be inspirational.  
 "A Little Matter" is worth reading simply for its discussion of the term "genocide". But there's so much more. If I get started I'm going to blather on at extreme length, so I won't.  The content of this book has been well covered by the reviewers before me, so I simply want to add my 5 stars. If you're interested in the issues suggested by the title, you've found an insightful, solidly referenced, powerfully argued resource.  Ward Churchill has an axe to grind, certainly, but he also has a forest to cut through. There are so many lies abroad in the world that we are all choking on them, I think, both victors and victims. This is a book I'm grateful to have read.  Stannard's wonderful and terrible "American Holocaust" is another. As are John Pilger's "Secret Country", and "Blood on the Wattle" by Bruce Elder, both of which concern Australia, my own sad, similarly haunted homeland 
 I am studying this subject for my doctora thesis. But I already haven't this book . I wish . 
 This volume is equally as good as the first edition only it's been brought up to date.  Unfortunately the Supreme Court is not static and decisions keep appearing which will eventually make a third edition necessary.  In the meantime one can purchase this book and use it as a handy reference in researching Supreme Court decisions that impact our current political landscape.  Much care and effort went into this work and the result shows.  It is readable and poignant.  Some entries may take careful reading to understand fully, and others are quite lengthy (who'd have thought that "Federalism" would take so many pages to explain), but overall this is a very handy book.  The only problem is what to do with the first edition once this one arrives at your door.  One possibility is to do what I did, bring the first edition to the cabin 
 Donald Davis leads his readers into a world of delighful remembrance. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and using this book as a conversation piece and journaling guide. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys exploring family and personal history 
 Rachmaninov's Vespers (aka All-Night Vigil) is a unique work for unaccompanied chorus that is rapidly becoming a staple in the repertoire of the major choral ensembles of the world (the Los Angeles Master Chorale recently performed the work sumptuously in the perfect acoustic of the Disney Hall - a performance that deserves a recording!) as well as the more sophisticated university and church choirs.  The work is staggeringly difficult intonation-wise, but despite the subtitle of 'All-Night Vigil' it is only slightly in excess of an hour's music.  But what superb music it is.  Rachmaninov beautifully combines the ancient with the modern, relying heavily on the Russian liturgy but infusing folk-like elements into the choral writing.  This recorded performance is about as pure as they come.  Paul Hillier conducts and his chorus responds with the extremes of mood and spiritual otherworldliness that the work demands.  Though there are many recordings of the Vespers now available, for the pure Russian, bass-favored sound, this recording is among the finest. Grady Harp, November 06   
 Anyone who listens to this kind of music, which is technically referred to as `experimental jungle' by those who sensibly avoid classifying it as `IDM', will already be aware of just what Aaron Funk a.k.a. Venetian Snares can do, but those who aren't so well versed in his back catalogue could be forgiven for assuming he basically just crushes people's heads with 200 bpm gabba in 7/8 time. He does indeed do that a lot. You can tell he enjoys it, too.  But `Rossz Csillag...' proves that he can do pretty much whatever he wants, and does it in style. This album deserves its place alongside the genre classics like Squarepusher's `Hard Normal Daddy' and Mu-ziq's `Lunatic Harness', because it is frankly staggering. He's raided the orchestral sample vault for this record and has shown a real flair for creating dark, movie-soundtrack melodies in the tradition of both classical music and smooth jazz. Typical instruments used here are the string family, and there's some very dynamic use of the trombone. You'd be amazed quite how well these complex and ambitiously instrumented melodies work under VSnares' trademark crisp jungle drum samples as they go reliably insane. All his trademark rhythmic aggression is still here, though it's not everywhere - it's carefully weighted and used sensitively where the mood calls for it. I know what you're thinking - "`mood' on a VSnares record??". Yes, it's here in spades, and it sounds awesome.  We all knew that Aaron Funk is anything but a one-trick pony, but this record goes beyond what we could have expected. The concept of this album is so ambitious and in anyone else's hands it would have been a disappointment, but the gauntlet has been thrown down with such style that it's hard to imagine being able to listen to anything in this vein again without saying "Yeah... but VSnares' Hungarian album is better... 
 Jennifer Lopez probably receives more mixed reviews than any other performer today.  She's had her ups and downs in her career, most of them deserved (i.e. 'Gigli,' the whole Bennifer thing, etc.).  But it's too bad this album had to be one of her downs.    People have slammed this album from the get-go.  About 80% of feedback I've heard about this CD has been negative.  And I just don't get it.  This album is one of the most creative and original albums of 2005, and by far Jennifer's best.  Jennifer teams up with some of the best in the music industry (long-time cohort Cory Rooney, Timbaland) to create a diverse blend of songs with original musical themes and catchy tunes.  The songs shift away from the thugged-out musical scene that is dominating the charts today and go towards a more retro-type sound with a modern spin.  I love the originality.  And despite what you've heard, it really does work.  The styles range from funk-meets-hiphop ("Get Right," "Whatever You Wanna Do") to middle eastern-meets-r&b ("Step Into My World") to cool pop/rock ("Cherry Pie") to smooth R&B ballads ("He'll Be Back," "Ryde or Die") to even eighties ("I, Love").  The production is excellent, and even Jennifer's vocals have improved.  She sounds better.  I think she has been taking some voice lessons.  Unlike the overly-sappy love letter to Ben, "This is Me... Then," "Rebirth" eliminates almost all aspects of Jennifer's personal love life, except maybe a theme of constant love in the midst of gossip and negativity found on the track "I Got U."  This album is not about the image... it's about the music.  And it's a shame that "J.Lo haters" had to slam this album with their negativity because, other than her voice, you would never be able to tell it was Jennifer singing.  If someone else recorded this album, it would probably have sold more.  Which is a shame because the majority of what hurt this album was a negative perspective on Jen.  People have missed out on the true artistry of this album.    Even so, I love this album even if no one else does because I recognize the artistic maturity it brings about.  And I'll be spinning this one in my CD player for many days to come.  The songs...  1.  Get Right - 8/10 - catchy, hip-hop-flavored funk tune.  Good song  2.  Step Into My World - 10/10 - hot track flavored with r&b and a middle-eastern sound.  pure ear candy  3.  Hold You Down - 7/10 - midtempo happy duet with fat joe about their friendship.  it's cute.  bad choice for second single, though.  4.  Whatever You Wanna Do - 10/10 - Awesome funky dance track.  hot!  5.  Cherry Pie - 10/10 - incredibly catchy classic-rock-flavored tune.  a totally different thing for Jennifer to do, which I really like and admire  6.  I Got U - 10/10 - "love is stronger than gossip and criticism" - that's the theme of this tune.  r&b uptempo track with very catchy melody.  i love it.  7.  Still Around - 9/10 - remniscent of "Still" from her previous album... almost a continuation... but a happier conclusion.  good midtempo pop track  8.  Ryde Or Die - 10/10 - my favorite song on the album!  awesome r&b ballad.  jennifer's vocals really surprised me here.  she sounds really improved!  9.  I, Love - 9/10 - ballad heavily flavored with an eighties beat.  cool track.  10.  He'll Be Back - 8/10 - good r&b ballad produced by Timbaland.  Should have been remixed as a single, which would have sounded better than the album version  11.  (Can't Believe) This Is Me - 6/10 - not my favorite.  kind of melodramatic pop ballad that doesn't quite fit the rest of the album  12.  Get Right (feat. Fabolous) - 0/10 - I give this a zero because it was not the remix!!!  the remix was hot!  all this is was the original but with fabolous's rap verse added.  i was very disappointed  Overall this album satisfies very well.  Highly recommende 
 I read this book to a class of second graders during our unit on Australia.  It was a wonderful way to review the Australian animals as well an the cities and foods of the continent.  The kids loved the pictures and  we took a poll asking who would try all the different foods discussed in  the book.   Even if you only buy this book for your own kids, it will  surely prompt a discussion about other cultures, foods, etc.  Well worth  the cost 
 The reason I gave this one such a high rating was because it is a fun book but also some of the info in the book I was able to show recent professors that gave more facts about things we were studying.  A prime example was what was written about Gregor Mendel.  It is a good book and enjoyable and you will learn alot 
 I like the notebook, especially how the cover is designed to be folded back so it won't mess up. The only thing I don't like is that the pages are not perforated. 
 I am an avid golfer and still refer to this book many times because the pictures are clear and help you with the position of your hands, arms, body and legs.  While Tiger overhauled his swing in the last 2 years and this book came out about 5 years ago, the fundamentals are still the same.  His swing plane is better now but it still was not too bad in 2001.  I would recommend this book for the novice to the advanced player looking for a good reference book 
 I have read a lot of things and seen a lot of interviews done with women who ONLY want to complain.  This book is NOT that.  It conveys the strength and weaknesses of the every day life of a Military spouse.  My husband is part of the 101st and served in OIF I and is now back for OIF III.  Probably not the best time for me to have read the book because I cried throughout the entire thing.  It was very true to life and I found myself identifying with EVERY story/sentiment in some way.  There were some things that were EXACTLY thoughts and conversations that friends and I have had.  I plan to buy more copies of this book to send to people that just don't understand the pride and the trials a spouse goes through.  Wonderful book 
 Primo Levi's description of his internment at auschwitz was very interesting for certain.  He doesn't paint the picture of his time at Auschwitz with broad strokes, but rather is very specific so that you understand the day to day life of the people there.    The chapters I found most intrigueing were the descriptions in the first few chapters about the journey to the camp, and then the chapter entitled "10 days" about their freedom regained.  This is a book for someone who wants to get down to the specifics of the trajedy that was the holocos 
 What can I say about Vacation that hasn't already been said?  It gave birth to a thousand quotes, made Chevy, Randy Quaid, John Candy and Anthony Michael-Hall all stars.  If you like articulate or less obvious humour, you won't find Vacation at all funny.  If, like me you find stuff like Caddyshack, Bachelor Party and The Burbs funny but haven't yet seen Vacation, do yourself a serious favour and get it.  
 Chris Van Allsburg has really produced the goods here.  Spectacular single page images opposite a short sentence or a phrase on the opposite (facing) page give the opportunity for endless speculation about the whys and wherefores and the creation of a story that can ever change each time you view it.  The size of the door at the bottom of the stairs, the bird peeling into life out of the avian wallpaper, whatever happend to other six chairs apart from the one aloft in the church?  The wriggling caterpillars and the book in the sleeper's (or dead person's?) hands.  The words and the images will continue to haunt and stimulate long after the book is closed.  For encouraging children in their imagination and for enabling adults to rediscover their sense of awe and wonder-Thank you, author and illustrator, Chris Van Allsburg.  
 When I become aware of a person, I really want to know where they came from.  What did they start out as?  How did they get to where they got?  Were they born rich and just got richer?  (Trump and Gates, for instance.)  Were they splitting rails like Abe Lincoln?  In the case of this book, Jack Welch was born to relatively modest beginnings and became one of the most powerful men in the world.  I found this book to be a great story of a man who went on to lead a giant corporation and gain status as a superstar CEO.  It was, to me, a fascinating book.    Good stuff about what it's like to play in the big leagues 
  The books are indeed a masterpiece collection of sorts. Very racy and laced with black humor and the sort of a plot which you can put into a perspective, for instance, the reference to mob psychology harks about to blacks burned/lynched in 1930's America, to many such instances in third world countries like India and Pakistan where many a woman, child and man have been victimc of such outbursts born out of sheer greed or religious intolerance. For instance there is a Muslim Religious leader in Australia saying that women invite rape by exposing their body parts. WOW! Count Olaf, indeed!  The writer is not shedding tears for the children here or is presenting a bleak picture for us to salivate on but is really afraid for us and trying to make us careful in our decisions and largely he is trying, most explicitly, to say that a family should bond well together - for all other relationships are transitory. A very practical one! Should I say!   
 every thing on this gun works it it the best buy eve 
 The Modern Library Chronicles offer readers concise history on a broad range of historical ideas, events, and nations.  "Nazism and War" is a really good introduction of Nazi ideological beginnings, its impact on Germany and its war making ability.  What I learned from this book (while not a complete neophyte of German/WW2 history):  1.  War was the basic element of Nazism.  Not just for territorial conquest, but of racial superiority and annihilation.  For example, the WW2 was lost as early as 1942 (right after Stalingrad), but the regime wasn't prepared to refocus strategy since its only stragegy was waging war endlessly.  Germany suffered the majority of war casualities in the last 2 years (1944-1945) which were also its most brutal.  2.  Majority of Germans believed they were victims in the post war world.  The German Army, the Wehrmacht, underwent a period of revisionist history in that it was not a advocate of the racial war.  Only in the mid 1990s did Germany feel comfortable discussing the army's role in the war.  3.  Nazism's collapse was total (unlike Baathism and its insurgency in post-war Iraq 2004).  Allies destruction of German forces in 1945 and the Nuremburg trials (where high level Nazis were hanged) removed any advantage Nazism once held by its believers.  This book has almost 220 full pages of text.  The remaining 20 pages or so are for notes and bibliography 
 I purchased this book a couple of years ago with the desire to improve my vocabulary before leaving college and entering the business world.  I had low expectations, and they were met and exceeded.  Here are some of the high points:  - The book includes a beginning examination to test your vocabulary prowess.    - Each chapter groups words together that have the same etymological background.  This is key in helping you remember definitions in the long run.  -Each chapter teaches/tests the pronunciation, definition, and forms of each word.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with this text.  The only behavior I strongly suggest is that you do not take a break from this book.  It becomes very difficult to jump back at a later time 
 I have been a "birder" for over 45 years and a gardener (in a very sloppy, haphazard way) for just about as long.  This is a wonderul work that fits well into my hobbies.  It is simple, practical and a joy to work with.  As another reviewer pointed out, the ideas put forth in this book actually work!  I was also thrilled that most of these projects were ones that my four grandsons were more than able to help with and in doing so, actually taught them something.  I happen to live in a rural area, infact, I live in the middle of the woods.  Most of the projects in this book were non-intrusive and blended in well with the natural look that my wife and I strive for.  Recommend you add this one to your library.  Now if I can just train my nine barn cats..... 
 This book has provided meaninful thoughts also inspiration.  Reading this encourages exploration of ones self.  THis beautiful book offers the reader with a daily dose of goodness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This album at first glance seems somewhat mediocre but leaves a craving in your ear that does not go away.  It's addiction is beyond belief and attaches itself to your life instantly.  It's all simple brilliance wrapped in tireless melody and guitar.  The piano ballads compliment Blake Sennet's guitar and vocals perfectly.  Other elements of blues and country play a role but the album floats whole heartedly like clouds on a Shin's cover. It's all truly captivating as well as compelling.  It's depth is unreal.  Taking you so far under the surface, you forget there was one.  It's indie soul but it's also more.    If your a rilo kiley fan, it's probably not at all what you would expect but hints at emulation in shadows.  This is album is truly a sleeper, at first glance it doesn't appear to have a whole lot under the hood or seems to have much depth.  But like a flower under the 'Sun Sun Sun' it flourishes into something powerful.  I must have listened to this album atleast a dozen times consecutively, for the moment it made no other album matter.  It's laid out so brilliantly that you insist on searching through it's timeless depth.  It's a great songwrite album like Ryan Adams or Bob Dylan but it speaks on different parallels, it's certainly aggressively passive.  It's subtle and passionate.  I haven't listened to an album this much since Ryan Adams 29.  This album carries with it an obscure country twang, truthful indie rock, well produced fusion of harmony, folk and singer-song write mastermind.  It's intruiging around every corner.  I now realize where a lot of Rilo Kiley's brilliant melodies come from.  Blake's voice may not be the strongest force out there but he makes it up with passion and originality, it's more like a heavy sketch of hills and valleys than it is a solid vector.  All framed carefully in its brilliant production.   
 I am a huge fan of the Let's Read and Find Out science series of books, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Clearly written information, great photographs, and wonderful illustrations educate the K-2 science student in an enjoyable way.  
 Why does an artist do what (s)he does?  Wolf Kahn gives insight into his thinking.  He touches on composition, use of color, and elements of design.  We know the colors, but we might not understand why they work.  He helps us understand.  Just out of curiosity I viewed the plates upsidedown, and they were very exciting viewed that way.  Try it!  The book has beautifully printed plates, but I found placement of some plates to the text somewhat inconvenient and perhaps a little confusing at times interrupting the continuity of reading and study.  I would have wished for some of the smaller paintings to have been actual size.  I would have learned and understood more.  You may learn some new vocabulary and some words he has defined for his own usefulness.  The cover and binding are confluent to the interior of the book.  I consider this book to have worthwhile the purchase and the time spent reading it.  What are my credentials you might ask?  I am nearing graduation in master of arts in studio painting and have degrees in journalism and education 
 Mount Vernon was both architecturally innovative and a true mirror of Washington's feelings and mind.  He never wrote an autobiography and his diaries consist largely of farm accounts, but in Mount Vernon, the authors  write, "he produced a text from which it is possible to coax a remarkably  full sense of his political convictions and of how, over time, they  changed." The book, George Washington's Mount Vernon, combines the public  and the private sides of his life and uses the combination to enrich our  understanding of both 
 ACTING IS GREAT, STORY IS SOLID. SMALL REALISTIC POCKETS OF ACTION.  DENNIS LEARY NAILS HIS ROLE AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE SUPPORTING CAST.   MUST SE 
 I am an aspiring writer, searching for new and fresh topics to work with so I can peddle my wares.  This book, the Magical Worlds of Harry Potter, has revealed to me different legends, myths, and historical facts I can use in my writings as many a basis for my characters to come.  This book gives an excellent review of links to ancient myths and legends and long since forgotten facts of history from J.K. Rowling's books of a hidden magical world in a universe of "Muggles."  It is true what David Colbert says how J.K. Rowling has taken (or has not taken as the case may be) these myths, legends, and facts and compiled them together into something that is considered so incredibly original and fresh.  So many things in the stories are considered completely her creation, but they are more the her creation of wonder and magic that bring these mythical things together for a world of witchcraft and wizardry.  To this book I give a vote of FIVE STARS and I highly recommend this book to everyone, aspiring writer or not.  If you do not wish to write for a living like I do, at the very least, you'll learn something you never thought you would ever learn before 
 Ah a classic. Just one of those movies that will never ever go out of style. Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin make a perfect team in this well done adaptation of the novel. Expertly cast and with very good cinematic effects, its just an all around great movie 
 Hitchens is a stringent critic.  He finds fault with everything.  As a matter of fact, his writing is so passionately critical that the reader suspends belief in his message... until the end is reached.    In Trial, the evidence implicating Kissinger in prolonging the Viet Nam War is so laboriously and extensively elaborated that the reader is not only convinced, but upset.    You will never look at politics the same way.  You will never look at government-delivered reasons for being in a war the same way.  Your world view will be inalterably changed after reading this book and you will find yourself thinking on a greater, more complex dimensional canvass 
 I got a big kick out of the "American Splendor" movie. In addition to being a fun flick, it brought Pekar some well-deserved attention. It was nice to see him get interviews and a chance to travel around.  It was pretty much a sure thing, then, that I would buy "Our Movie Year," a comeek about Pekar's brush with fame.  Well . . . I'm not sorry I bought the book, but it's a mixed bag.  Here's the disappointing part: Unlike "Our Cancer Year," this isn't a single story book, planned from the beginning, or even a collection of original short pieces. It is a compilation of dozens of short pieces, apparently reprinted from magazines and Harvey's own comic. This would be OK, but in many cases they cover the same events. Some are reprises of how Harvey came to write autobiographical comics . . . a story well known to anyone who has read the earlier "American Splendor" anthologies. Sure, in some cases the material is told from a different angle, or in more detail. For example, Harvey's reprisal of his rocky relationship with David Letterman is more honest and introspective.  What really made this book worth buying was what might be considered padding, totally unrelated to the events surrounding the movie: Short illustrated pieces on famous authors, jazz legends, and other cultural items. Items like these are how Harvey earns his living, and it was really neat to see them. In addition to being interesting in their own right, they show that Pekar can more than "stories about nothing."  I give this one a thumbs up, and would especially recommend it to those who haven't read any of Pekar's other books 
 This devotional is a terriffic, fresh approach to reading through the Bible in an overview or summary format.  Each day's reading (using a modern translation) is accompanied by brief and informative text from Brenda Quinn or Philip Yancey, and then 1 or 2 questions to ponder.  Both Quinn and Yancey have a reader-friendly, intelligent manner of writing that invites one to think rather than telling one what to think. Makes a nice gift book, too.  
 Lloyd, this is soooo hot! From front to back-beginning to end, love it! I am @ work & have played it over & over for hours 
 This movie is such a breath of fresh air. Finally there's a movie that's profound, amusing, and relatable. It's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with Jean Louisa Kelly or Amanda Peet 
 I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't.  It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any!  I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.    The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion!  I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn.   I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be 
 A great pairing of two musical giant 
 This is an excellent book for those seeking to integrate spirituality into their workplace. It covers many common concerns and issues, but also leaves enough flexibility for the reader to adapt the content to their own situation. A good and easy read--I read it during breaks at work 
 Very good product.  I am allergic to many make up products, but this one I have not had any problems with.  Very satisfied!  
 Dark Light is a great intro to a subject that we all take for granted, but whose scientific and cultural origins are a mystery to   most of us, including me before I read the book. If you want to discover how the western world looked at the new scientific and commercial force of electricity, this book is perfect! From the early days of SB Morse and the telegraph,(artist turned inventor and promoter), to some weird "New Age" (for the time) ideas about electricity and health, the incredible carrers of Edison, Tesla (the overlooked genius), among many others, this book scores a bull's eye. Plus a nice trip into the 1892 Chicago Columbian exhibition, through the controversial electric chair, and into the x-ray, plus a lot more. There is not too much about how the nation was wired up, and how the utility companies were formed, but this may be the author's next project 
 This book is powerful and honest.  Coming out in the same year as Burroughs' Naked Lunch the two works bear many striking similaruites.  Compared to the other works by Kerouac I've read (On the Road, The Dharma Bums and parts of Maggie Cassidy, Subteranean angels) this book seems strikingly different.  The work that Jack and Ginsberg did on the Heroin infested Burroughs' scriblings to come up with the powerhouse work, Naked Lunch, must have had a tremendous effect on Jack.  This work shares the disragard for the line between fantasy and reality, a compelte self indulgeance of the writer (I can see Jack with his reams of paper, just clacking away, howling with leerie laughter like the Shadow) and a dedication to storytelling and imagination that Naked Lunch displayed.  for a whilrwind read fest, try to digest the two in succession 
 Music is all really good.  Interesting thing is the songs all sound really happy but the lyrics are totally negative.  She sounds so sweet but talks about some pretty funky stuff.  Sounds like someone really messed her over!!  Sweet on the outside, sour on the inside. 
 What an outstanding book! I would not be exageratting by saying that this book has influenced me, particularly my leadership style, more than any other. The ideas therein pop into my head several times a week, as the wisdom of crowds rears its head over the course of my day. Examples include viewer ratings on youtube, student ratings of teachers at the school where I work, online doctor ratings by patients, movie recommendations by the masses on Netflix, and more. The collective people's opinions are generally dead on - even when individual opinions vary. This is the premise of the book, and one that I am now firmly convinced of.   Well done 
 This hefty book goes through the history of the United States from the Age of Discovery with great sailors to the 20th Century where America had established their position as one of the world's superpowers. It's very interesting to see how The ideas that we hold sacred were almost happened upon by the founders and the fact that those ideas persevered through adversity from all directions. Bennett describes the political scene in depth and leaves out much of the cultural makeup of the nation, but one can still get a good feel for the way life was back then. The author gives a strong backing to the Republican party throughout American History (claiming Jefferson's party was 'Republican' instead of Democratic Republican) and shows the 'Democrats' as the clear antagonist to freedom and prosperity. This may be true in some contexts, but Bennett fails to recognize the inconsistency within the Republican party- starting out more democratic and ending up more federalist, and how the republican party started off as radicalists and entered the 20th century as the conservatives. This ebb and flow of political status is more an more evident as the current administration shows- what fiscally conservative politician can claim to have presided over the largest government budget in the history of America?   Bennett's tone when he describes the Civil War is conciliatory, but he seems to shine a positive light on Lincoln and the Union effort during the conflict, which is appropriate for their preserving the Union, but perhaps not because of the extreme losses that it caused. 600,000 Americans died. It's very difficult to see that as good in any way. Credit to Bennett for a generally objective view on the entire survey 
 This cookbook is filled with healthy and delicious recipes. It is well-written, with easy to follow directions and ingredients that are readily available. I really like the 30-day meal plan that is included; it takes all the guess work out of menu planning. While I was not a vegetarian before I began using this cookbook, I am now! The food is so delicious and high enough in protein that I don't miss meat at all--although for you die-hard carnivores, there are many recipes that have meat-optional directions. This book has everything from breakfast foods through desserts and these recipes have gained approval from my toughest critics: my 10- and 14-year-old sons. Although not diet food, my husband and I have both lost weight since we began following the 30-day plan. The food is so nutritious and satisfying, that our junk food cravings have been greatly reduced. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for healthy and delicious recipes. Enjoy 
 This is just a great collection of songs. Of course I'm being biased because the Allman Brothers happen to be one of my favorite rock groups, but if you are a "newbie" to their music you might want to start with this flawless CD. Even if you've been hanging out with Greg and Duane and the rest of the boys for some time, you still might want to invest in this CD because it really is a superb anthology.  One of my favorite songs on this CD is "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed". It is just a terrific jam and the story behind it is just great. Turns out Duane was in the cemetery one day just hangin' out and playing the guitar and came up with the music to this song and when he stood up to go home he saw a tombstone that said, "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed". Just a fun bit of trivia, but it really endeared me to this group because yeah, on the outside they are a lot of grit, but inside they're pure soul and soul is something that's missing in a lot of the groups today. There's no sense of spirit...no driving force...just people who want to "cash in" as fast as they can.   In 25 years Brittney Spears will be "Brittney who?" Usher will be already be ushered out, but the Allman Brothers will still be - living or dead - kicking it into full gear.  Peace & Blessing 
 I can understand why some reviewers are quite frustrated with the author's so claimed secrets. If you go through the content page here, you are very likely to get the impression that they are "common sense" or "cliche" repeated regularly in all self help books. What makes this book better is the short conclusions in the end of each "secret" summarizing research findings of social scientists per that "secret", many with statistics quantifying impact of individual factors, say,   Those who sacrifice their individual beliefs and backgrounds ultimately express one third less satisfaction with their jobs and almost two thirds less satisfaction with their lives. FRanklin and Mizell 1995 (22 Remember who you are and where you are)  Those whose careers continute to have momentum are 53 percent more likely to engage in healthy life habits than those whose careers are stalled. Roberts and Friend 1998 (41 Exercise and Eat Right)  Those who spend a lot of time worrying about their jobs are 17 percent less productive than workers who seldom or never worry about their job. Verbeke and Bagozzi 2000 (47 You'll get what you're afraid of)  The productivity of employees who score high in dedication to their career is 33 percent less likely to be affected by the quality of thier managers than is the production of low dedication employees. Pollock 1998 (87 Learn to lead yourself)  Managers of production facilities who are meeting their quality targets actually invest 2o percent more time in improving their practices than managers of facilities that are falling short of their goals. In other words, the better off work harder to get even better. Coulthard 1998 (89 People who have it right work harder to make it better)  Successful people spend t least fifteen minutes everyday thinking about what they are doing and can do to improve their lives. Sigmund 1999 (94 Keep goals where you can see them)   Those who do not feel they are taking steps toward their goals are five times more likely to give up and three times less likely to feel satisfied with their lives. Elliott 1999 (99 Take action)  In my opinion, the references in each "secret" and their bibliography provided do help. The book is good and concise enough to be placed on a working desk as a tool or first aid kit. In short, well worths the time and the price.   p.s. I had read the author's first book "The 100 simple secrets of happy people" as well. Surprisingly the two books are quite different or not repetitive. If you like this "successful" one, you should get the "happy" one as well. 
 I love chill out music. After a long day at the office, I like to kick back and unwind to music that would calm my nerves. I am quite particular when it comes to chill out music. A lot of chill out compilations are either too boring or too predictable. One of my new favorite chill out cds is "Windham Hill Chill 2". I bought it out of curiousity. On this two cd compilation there is an ambient disc and an acoustic disc. I thought the combination of ambient and acoustic music was intriguing.   While "Windham Hill Chill 2" is no Buddha Bar or Chill Out in Paris, the music is certainly pleasant to listen to. I found the music to be very relaxing to listen to. Both discs are excellent. I have to admit that I am partial to disc two which is the acoustic disc. Lisa Lynne's "Welcome" is the stand out track on that cd for me. It is absolutely breathtaking, if not spiritually moving to this music lover. I also enjoyed "Nocturne" by Steve Frouiaga", and "Inside Out" by Liz Story. On disc 1, I found myself shocked to like Yanni's "In the Mirror" given the fact that I really don't like Yawni's music (boring and cheesy). "In the Mirror" is a beautiful instrumental. My other favorite songs includes Lili Haydn's "The Longing" (a sumptuous classical/pop instrumental), State of Grace's "Stabat Mater", and Paul Schwartz's "Thalaster".   All the songs on both discs are breathtaking. My only issue with the compilation is that I would categorize the music as more new age than chill out. When I think of chill out music, I think of Portishead, Massive Attack, Delerium, and Olive. The music on this compilation is more new age but I'm just being picky. After eharing this cd, I definitely need to check out the original "Windham Hill Chill" compilation. 
 Oh my.  Over two hundred reviews and not one obviously done by a person of the female persuasion.  What gives?  You would think this wasn't chic-lit.  Okay, so maybe it isn't a book about traveling jeans and romance, but this is the beginning of a great series that has been described rather well by august reviewers much lower down in the ratings than I, so I won't drone on.   What I will note is that if you are a demon for detail there is about as much here as a soul could want.  More importantly, the characters are interesting and thankfully flawed.  How horrid it would have been to find yet another series where the main characters are stoically noble -- barf.  In this book people are a little overweight (okay 14 stone is nothing to sneeze at) and not particularly attractive and all the more likable for it.  The dynamism between Aubrey (the Captain) and Maturin (the doctor) definitely works, and their friendship is at the center of the adventure.  And the only other thing I wanted to note is the humor.  I am re-reading this book after a lapse of years and am pleasantly surprised to find humorous moments interspersed throughout.  For example, there is a lovely scene where Aubrey is sitting down to dine with his guests and one of the courses is described thusly:  "They ate an acceptable turbot - acceptable after the flour-and-water paste had been scraped off him - and then the steward brought the ham.  It was a ham that could only have come from a hog with a long-borne crippling disease, the sort of ham that is reserved for officers who buy their own provisions;  and only a man versed in morbid anatomy could have carved it handsomely."  Five Stars.  Well written adult tale with interesting characters.  Contains adult themes and references - those sailors will get up to some mischief - but is in no way pandering.  
 This book is a great base for those who do not wish to receive the torment of organized religion forcing individuals to accept their faith or become a bane to society.  Within it are numerous example of how to lead a non-religous life while still embrace morality and tolerance.  I reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to find an outlet to repressed opinions and didnt know how to properly express them or would like to know more about being a humanist 
 Belief in supernatural phenomena ranging from poltergeists to telepathy remains strong and pervasive in an otherwise rational, modern, secular, science oriented world. Especially common is belief in continuing contact with (or the continuing presence of) deceased family members. Gillian  Bennet interviewed women in Manchester, England, asking them questions  about ghosts and other aspects of the supernatural. "Alas, Poor  Ghost!" lays out her rather impressive research methodology and  techniques, as well as her findings, analysis. Of special interest is   supplemental material assisted by Kate Bennett, a gerontological  psychologist who presents and discusses new research with a group of women  in Leicester, England. "Alas, Poor Ghost!" concludes with Bennett  placing her work in historical context through a discussion of case studies  in the history of supernatural belief. "Alas, Poor Ghost!" will  prove fascinating, informative, original reading for students of folklore,  occultism, metaphysics, cultural traditions and beliefs 
 Chesterton expressed his passion for history and sacrificial heroism in this ballad.  If you enjoy the imagery and values of Arthur, CS Lewis and the Iliad, you will enjoy this short book.  "Heart of the heroes, ride! 
 If you are a student of theology, Western history of almost any sort, church-state relations, sociology of religion, philosophy of religion, or are just a mad autodidact, you already have this book. All primary sources, and fascinating reading for any occasion. If it played a role in the formation of Western theology and political-ecclesiological development, it is in this small book.  There is information in this book you don't even know that you are missing, so look at it this way: church histories are necessary and very important, but wouldn't you like to read the same documents the historians are reading, and draw your own conclusions? An essential tool for professors, students, pastors, and educated Westerners of all stripes 
 I so love this book! To me it is a reminder to every soul out there that we are not human beings having a spiritual experience we are spiritual beings having a human experience. We come down here to earth to learn, grow and do the best we can and then we go home - Graduate. I love it so much that I have given it to many of my friends. Thanks Echo! 
 I am a high school football coach in Connecticut and can clearly say that this book and volume 2 have helped me become a better coach to my players, a better teacher to my students, and a better mentor to my staff. You can not argue with the success of Bill Belichick and his staff, so why not try and soak up everything written about what they have accomplished. I constantly use these books as resources for my teaching and coaching. I have had friends in the coaching profession read the books and improve their programs as well. I hope Mr. Lavin can go out to Notre Dame and start picking Charlie Weis' mind. An outstanding read- something no manager, teacher, or coach should be without. 
 This movie was great due to the fact that it shows what life really is like in the so-called "Ghetto". It shows the endless crime and reality of the New York Streets. Even though its a fictional work, it depicts fact. Places like East New York Brooklyn, and the South Bronx are constant reminders of the Urban War in the streets--and this movie would be a good portrayel of the "hood life". I recommend this movie to all who want to know what ghetto life is like...check it out. 
 Gilles Kepel has produced a significant book that wonderfully addresses the complexities the world currently faces in trying to figure which way Muslims will turn; whether towards violent Jihad or an Islamic Democracy.    Kepel deals with many subjects pertaining to this issue.  However, he spends a great deal of time comparing the goals of the neoconservative movement in the U.S. with al Qaeda and its intellectual prognosticators.  On the one hand are the neocons.  The neocons have clear goals in mind: securing the world's oil supply for the west; protecting and securing Israel; ensuring the continued dominance of the U.S., especially in military terms.  However, they have deluded themselves into following fantastical policies that end up exacerbating problems (i.e. the invasion of Iraq and the blind support for Ariel Sharon) rather than improving the situation.    On the other hand are al Qaeda and its fellow travelers.  Kepel explores this complex phenomenon by traveling through the history of Islamist thinking.  He follows the development of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and beyond.  He also spends a great deal of time explaining the development of religious authority in Saudi Arabia, including the state sponsored Salafi movement that was more inward looking, and the violent jihadist movement, more political and overt in its aims.  These two ideologies running into each other has been a contributing factor of much of the terror and insecurity in the world.  Kepel sees as the best hope for a future Islamic democracy lying in Europe, where different states have taken divergent measures to respond to the challenge of new cultures.  But the ends in each of the states of Western Europe are the same: to imbue in the Muslims in their society a respect for pluralism and democracy.  Kepel sees the potential for the inculcation of democratic values in European Muslims having far reaching implications, for example by creating a respect for democratic institutions and the possibility of those Muslim supporters of democracy exporting their ideas back to their home countries.  Either way, democracy can't be imported by foreigners, especially by force.  Kepel has written an important book.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in confronting one of the most important challenges of our time 
 For those that like a musical that isn't really a musical, a comedy farce of purposeful gender confusion and a love story, you are in for a treat.  Andrews, Preston and Garner are excellent in their leading roles and the story is just involved enough to keep you entertained without losing the delightful comedy of the topsy-turvy role-play.  Look forward to comedic awkward situations, a tender love story, wonderful musical numbers (on stage, no one spontaneously bursts into song), and a great cast of characters.  Take an honest look at the gay side of Paris and the delightful rise of a down-on-her-luck woman's rise to "male" stardom 
 Nadine Gordimer's writing in Jump was amazing.  As an English Major, I can honestly say that this book was one of the few that actually had me anxious to turn the page.  The way that Gordimer leaves the endings wide open for  interpretation has the reader questioning the intent of the author as well  as the characters 
 Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you. This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift. I think they'll thank you for it. Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL. I love this movie; this is how movies should be made. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen. The entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about. Look for Keira Knightley in a supporting role. A Shawn James five star essential movie. Definitely get this movie along with the wonderful Muriel's Wedding, a great Australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey.  
 Super product. Cleanup is a breeze. The pan appears to have a really tough non-stick surface. I have only had it a couple weeks, but the performance of the pan generates confidence that it is durable 
      El primer album que compre de Miguel Bose fue "Lo Mejor de Bose" en cassette.  Me gusto mucho, exepto las canciones Reggae y un par de aburridas como "Muro" y "No Encuentro un Momento Pa'Olvidar".  Me encanto "Duende", que se encuentra en XXX.  "Como un Lobo" tambien esta en XXX, y tambien es buena.      XXX solo tiene una cancion aburrida, "Corazon Infame".  Todas las demas canciones me gustaron, unas mas que otras.  Las que mas me gustaron ademas de "Duende" y "Como un Lobo" fueron "Quieres America," "?Quien la Mato?," "Justine," y "La Gran Ciudad".  "Que No Hay" es buena, aunque un poco lenta.  "Over My Head" es buena exepto que como yo entiendo Ingles, noto el acento de Bose que y eso me distrae bastante, a pesar de que yo tambien tengo acento en Ingles.      "Quieres America," "Quien la Mato?," y "Duende" tienen musica electronica, y si a ud. le gusta Depeche Mode seguramente le gustarian estas canciones.  "La Gran Ciudad" es interesante porque no tiene efectos electronicos, es un poco lenta, pero aun asi muy entretenida.  "Justine" tampoco suena como electronica pero es mas rapida, habla de como es cruel esta muchacha, y me parecio interesante.      Otra cosa que me gusto es que este album es disponible en cassette, y asi lo compre.        Le daria 4 estrellas y media, pero como no se puede lo redondie a cinco 
 Some of the reviews I've read here do hit the nail on the head.These "Greatest Hits" cover 20 years (1951-71), and,perhaps inevitably, some of them may not stand the test of time.Others have been recorded by others,perhaps better. Still,with 22 cuts,some are bound to be great and they are! "Stranger in Paradise" is interpreted well here. Ditto for most of the others. I actually like the Spanish sounding "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".You can imagine a flamengo dancer castenetting in the background. There are three in a row that Tony owns: "Put on a Happy Face",among the most zesty numbers ever,"San Francisco",one of my all-time favorites,and I still visualize the cable cars and spectacular views when I hear it, and "I Wanna Be Around",the great comeback from someone who's been unceremoniously dumped."Shadow of your Smile" is top notch,as is "Smile",though Nat Cole's version is far better. All the rest are right on the money,though "Something",which Sinatra actually recorded twice,never hits the mark for anyone,including the late George...Strongly recommended for the over thirty crowd looking for a change from the blaring noise usually in the top 40 
 If you are like me, you probably are interested in learning more and maybe perfecting the ability of reading people. This book offers the basics and is fun reading the different 'types' the author reviews in the book. After reading I found myself paying a bit more attention to people's body language, but it's nothing I've committed to memory. This is just a fun, interesting book on the subject 
 Easy to read and understand, plus the Commentary really explain and break it down to my understanding. Just a Great Awesome Bible! 
 Who is more qualified to help provide us with a book about the quilts of Gee's Bend, but Mr. Bill Arnett who has championed the makers of these quilts and their works since 'discovering' them years ago in the tiny community of Gee's Bend about thirty miles southwest of Selma, Alabama?   The quilts first went on tour in 2002 and have been touring ever since.  I learned of the ladies of Gee's Bend and their quilts from a PBS documentary first aired in 2003 and have anxiously hoped they would one day come to my part of the country.  When, earlier this year, I found the quilts would indeed be coming to the Orlando Museum of Art, I purchased, The Quilts of Gee's Bend: Masterpieces from a Lost Place, documenting the quilts, and the lives of their various makers, with beautiful, full-color illustrations of the quilts.    In February, 2007, when I was finally able to enjoy the quilts in person, I was happy to discover the book had accurately depicted the quilts, and their makers, paralleling an exhibition that should be seen and appreciated by all.    I purchased a copy of The Quilts of Gee's Bend: Masterpieces from a Lost Place, for the art teacher of my children's school. This beautiful book encouraged her to take her middle and high school art students to the exhibition.  The book helped the students to first see and read about what they were going to view and then became a superb keepsake of a most memorable trip.    
 This show is great,but with most of cast still alive its a shame they can't get some of them together for some inside information and other bonus material for these season sets. One of the best seasons though 
 a very honest overview of the positives and negatives relating to radio advertising.  Much of the information provided is not something that your local radio rep would normally share with you.  I'm sure my business will benefit from the concepts and information presented in this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this book.

 This album would have been killed had these guys jumped to a major label.  The extra orchestration would probably have caused some Neanderthal at Universal or Geffen call for a cleaner, more produced, sound.  However, coming from Seattle I figured Pretty Girls Make Graves would take more of a Steve Albini approach despite the recent broadening of their horizons.  While they did switch labels (from Lookout to Matador) they haven't lost one ounce of the visceral appeal from their first album (which was only eight songs delivered in under a half an hour).    The arrangements are more complex, and there are more instruments, but they still manage to pump up the adrenaline.  This is one of those albums where almost every emotion you experience in a lifetime is represented at one point musically, or it at least tricks you into thinking so.  The final song, "A Certain Cemetery" seems to cram all those possible feelings into a five-minute song.  Pretty Girls add more to their music than just an extra instrument here and there, they play around with song structure enough that if they would have waited to drop the piano on a later album they would still have had more than enough new sounds to please their old fans.    Perhaps the biggest leap forward is how lead singer, Andrea Zollo, has carved out space for her voice.  The rest of the band allows Zollo to take the forefront, nudging their guitars up against her vocals.  Things are sparser, but still maintain a tight feel.  Pretty Girls Make Graves have created an album that pushes them beyond the post-hardcore trappings they seemed destined to live out, and at this point they can do anything with their sound 
 I loved reading the Ludlum's covert one novels and read all of them and was disappointed that there weren't more until I saw that this one by Larkin continued the series.  It brought back all the adventure and spine tinkling situations that I had read in Ludlum's books.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and am looking to read more of these.  I'm hooked and love it 
 In this charming tale of mistaken identity, cosmic romance, and laugh out loud depictions of small-town life, Judi McCoy delivers a fantastic read.  The characters and setting are so vividly described that I feel as if I'd had a piece of cherry pie in Lucy's luncheonette.  Wanted: One Perfect Man was difficult to put down (I love when that happens!) and I can't wait to dive into the next book of the series.  Way to go, Judi 
 William Hare uses an evenhanded approach to objectively analyse two thousand years of Middle East history in a compelling manner than entertains as well as it informs. Hare provides a solid point of  intersection by shifting the action from Arab to Jewish viewpoint as the  story unfolds, without favouring one nation over the other. I also  appreciate that fact that the author connects the major events shaping the  history of the region to the activities of the major powers involved there  through the ages, such as the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain and the United  States. 'Struggle for the Holy Land' is a must-read for the historical  researcher as well as the concerned individual who wonders what the future  might hold. As one who has worked and lived in the Middle East for several  years, Mr Hare has greatly enhanced my understanding of this fascinating  region where civilisation began. I cannot recommend this work highly  enough 
 I remember my mother reading me the Brer Rabbit stories when I was small and I was trying to retell them from my recollection, but thankfully I found this version on tape read by Lester at the library.  My children loved the stories and I really enjoyed Lester's wit, humor, and colloquialism.  I only gave the book four stars because of the violent and underhanded nature of Br'er Rabbit, himself.  Both of my children are fairly sensitive but didn't have trouble with this aspect of the book--it was me.  I didn't want to keep telling them the ones where Br'er Rabbit would have some innocent, gullible creature sacrificed in his place 
 I quite simply loved this book.  Sure, it wasn't perfect and had a few holes, but it was an absolute blast to read.  I found myself reacting to it like it was a movie at times.  I could not put it down and I most definitely recommend it 
 Myself and three other friends read this book together in college and I can confidently say that it changes the entire direction of my life. Jones takes you through the necessary steps to write your mission statement. It was clear and easy. Once you know your mission statement decisions are so much easier to make, regarding the direction of your life. Does this task align with my overall mission or not? In the age of busyness and trying to constantly align our priorities, this is a very important starting point to this never-ending challenge. 
 I could not put this book down. Light years better than The Da Vinci Code, THIS is the book that the Vatican should be worried about.    I can see why Janet Tyson is no longer a Catholic. If her findings are right, Jesus himself would not recognize the Church that was born out of the early First Century.    In fact, if she is right, Jesus' mission had nothing to do with what we Christians believe as the central tenets of the faith. Rather, in Tyson's analysis and reconstruction of the Gospel of John, Jesus is on a mission from God the Father to restore the ancient kingdom of Israel.  A few months ago I read hstorian & poet Robert (I Claudius) Graves' novel King Jesus which was a persuasive and hypnotic page-turner that pictured Jesus as the rightful heir to the kingship of Israel.  Tyson's thesis is not so far from Graves' except that, while Graves wrote a fictional account, Tyson has put forth a meticulously detailed yet highly readable non-fiction.  In November, Tyson has another book coming out which looks like a sequel. I hope it is because when you get to the end of Our Man in Judea, you are ready for more!  
 "If I should die before I wake" by Han Nolan was a very unique and exciting book. There are two main characters in the book, Hilary who at the beginning of the book is an anti-Semitist and becomes a much better person through her understandings of the second character named Chana, who happens to be a Jewish girl in the Holocaust. Chana is brought into the book through the unconscious and hospitalized dreams of Hilary. 	 Personally, Hilary and Chana the two main characters in the book interested me a lot because they where such opposites, but yet they could relate to each other in such an understanding way. This book taught me lessons in life, such as listening and respecting others morals and beliefs. Also the format of the book when it goes between characters is very unique. This book was able to catch my attention from the time I picked it up until the time I was finished. There are many parts that have you asking questions and parts where you as a reader want to change the problems the characters seem to be going through. 
 This one has it all!  Romantic tension, exploding ships, climactic battle scenes, and (my favorite) ingrigue!  The characters, are at their most Jack-and-Stephenesque.  O'Brian manages to fit more meaning and emotion into a single simple sentence than any author since Austen and he manages to fit more events into this book than many of his others.  Anyone who has gotten this far in the series doesn't need me to urge them to read this one, but I couldn't help but sing its praises 
 Should be 10 stars.  Although I loved-loved The Clash (saw them in '82), I admit that, after an initial brief orientation with Joe Strummer's solo work in the '90's, I mistakenly put him aside. Big Mistake. Then Joe tragically died a few years back.   A year ago I was at a friend's place for a party and I was caught by the music playing, which sounded like Joe's voice but the music was so friggin' hip sounding. Wow!, I said when I was told it was Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. As much of a music connaisseur as I am, at that point I felt very inadequate.  From then on, X-Ray, Go-Go and Streetcore have been permanent staples in my CD player. The remarkable thing is that they NEVER get played out no matter how many times I hear them. The combination of acoustic and electronic instruments along with punk style vocals and various rhythms is the greatest thing I've ever, ever heard in the last, oh, 10 years.   As I get a little older, I welcome mellower sounding music, especially if it has a punk soul and great lyrics. Global A Go-Go and the other Mescalero recordings are the best of both worlds and are also totally versatile. They are good for parties, chilling out, driving, cleaning the house, or just spacing out.  I typically give CD's that I like 5 star ratings. Well GLOBAL A GO-GO, X-RAY STYLE, and STREETCORE, are all MASTERPIECES in music that deserve their own category of being beyond ratings.  RIP Joe. This music will never die 
 I read Kessler's two previous books and loved them.  They gave an inside account of some of recent business history's more noteable events.  This book was rather different.  It is a Cliff Notes version of the history of business innovation.  As such, it is an informative jumping off point for anyone interested in taking a deeper look at the history of technology.  It is written in an informal style as is quite accessible to the non-engineer.    Where this book falls down in comparison to Kessler's other books is in the bringing together of disparate themes to help the reader form a coherent picture of an event or process.  Kessler could have done a better job of tying this all up for the reader.  All in all an entertaining read, worth the effort 
   I came home from kindergarten every day and watched Julia while I had my cookies and milk; when this book came out my mother and I started cooking in earnest from it. Julia wrote this just for people taking the first serious plunge into the kitchen and you will need other cookbooks, but this one taught me several good things.  First, the basics of serious cooking at the age of ten. Second, how to read instructions and follow them. I have overhauled tractor engines because Julia Child taught me basic cooking as a small child. It's a lot of the same critical thinking and ability to read an instruction manual. It's still a simple enough cook book though.   So that's where this book really shines, as a great start for novice cooks and a good reference for a lot of classic recipes. I still think it's good for the kids too. Mine are experimenting with it at ages ten and twelve. Why waste time on underpowered kiddy cookbooks when a pared down classic will do the job so much better? I still grab it for quick and easy dinner and I highly recommend it for anyone taking the first plunge into the kitchen. 
 Reeves and Campbell cut through all of the drug war crap in this superb cultural analysis.  The role of the news -- especially the television network news -- is clear in the creation of a major "drug  problem" and the need for a war on drugs.  Need to know why the jails  are overflowing with drug users?  As this book points out, the Reagan-era  news loved this "lock 'em up" story 
 I was very impressed. The radio took no time to setup and worked as promised.  You do need internet access to setup the channels used in your area or a list ahead of time 
 One of the unfortunate things for fans of Werner Herzog's cinema is the rather feeble and pathetic array of literature there is out there. Timothy Corrigan's essential Herzog book "The Films of Werner Herzog: Beyond Mirage and History" has been out of print for some years and besides, only covers Herzog's career up to 1985. If you don't have access to academic journals and university libraries the alternative is to pay through the nose. A definitive study of the great man's films is required. Cronin's book kind of fills that gap as it does at least deal with most of Herzog's important works. The interest of this book comes from the fact that it a book of interviews and Herzog's views are both illuminating and interesting. I could almost here his hypnotic German accent as I read it. However, a lot of old ground is trodden over and if any reader is looking for new and exciting tales of the raving Klaus Kinski, they will be disappointed. Many of the anecdotes and comments Herzog comes out with are repeated in My Best Fiend (1999) and on a number of commentary tracks for his DVD's. Far more interesting are his comments on less known films such as "Ballad of the Little Soldier" (1984), "Echoes From a Sombre Empire" (1990) and "The Dark Glow of the Mountains" (1984). So many myths have sprung up around Herzog and his work, that perhaps now, mostly due to documentation and the media they feel somewhat stilted and stale. Herzog is at his best when expounding his own theories on the effects of cinema, and in his rants against academia. But its clear the man has a philosophy and goal which he is trying to achieve through the medium of cinema, not simply a director making money and then moving on to the next thing. Cronin's questions are in the main insightful, but at times he comes across in the same way as Herzog himself did in one of his best films "The Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner" (1974) as an excitable and breathless fan. Overall, an interesting and thought provoking read and probably one of the best in this ongoing range by Faber and Faber, the other I recommend is the David Lynch one. But this book does sit rather strangely with Herzog and it wasn't something I ever expected him to do. 
 The book "Let Fury Have the Hour" is a great book if you are into punk rock music. In the book Joe Strummer tells us all about what punk was all about in that era and how everything worked. Without The Clash punk would probably be just another rage that your parents would tell you about. This book is good for people any age. Joe Strummer tells about every type of music. Joe tells you about punk from the birth of it until the "death" 
 i think that this is a must by for anyone that wants something different, as there isnt anyothers like it!!! i know may people want heartland to keep going and i love it just as much but it coudnt be written aout much more as it was nearly out of steam nd laurn brooke must have wanted to end on a good note also it eaves youyr imagination to wander!! i love chestnut hill and hte description is fantastic it make you feel like your actually there, i cant wait for the next ones!! 
 Artists like Nik Kershaw, Andrew Gold and Jude Cole are part of tht select club whose magic seems obvious to music afficianados but obscured to the mass of the music buying public. I don't know what justice there is in being a musician's musician or a songwriter's songwriter, but Nik Kershaw is both. I was of course familiar with Nik's 80's output - "The Riddle" being a class pop record that is still very listenable today and "Radio Musicola" that followed, revealed a sharp wit and keen observations, as well as an artist that didn't take himself too seriously. That, however is no excuse for us not to!! Buy "15 Minutes" and hear the musings of a mature artist, blessed with a great pop sensibility. 
 This is a very comprehensive book about the history of some of the world's most popular drinks like beer,  wine, coffee, tea, rum and coca cola.   Tom Standage did a lot of research for this book.  He went to San Francisco to gather information about beer.  He went as far as France to get information about wine.     I was surprised to learn that the workers who built the pyramids in Egypt were paid in beer for their labor.  I also learned that beer was invented as a result of farming in ancient times.  I also learned that coffee was first invented  in the Arab country of Yemen.   I enjoyed reading coffee became popular throughout the world and how it was enjoyed by scientists Issac Newton and Edmund Halley.  Coffee is enjoyed by people in all different professions, and it was fascinating to read how coffee's popularity spread so quickly. I learned that coca cola was first sold to treat ailments like head and stomach aches.  I also discovered that early versions of coca cola had traces of cocaine in it.  I enjoyed reading about how tea became so popular in England.    There is an additional chapter in the book about the importance and popularity of water in the world today.  A History of The World in 6 Glasses is an informative and entertaining book about the drinks people quench their thirst with 
 I read this book the first time 10 years ago. It is neither the best-written nor most important novel I have read during that time but it sticks with me more than any other and I return to it again and again. I think this is because it speaks about how to learn that you are a grown-up when you perceive  yourself as the younger, perhaps more adventurous and brave soul you were in the past. As a parent, wife, teacher one often feels consumed by roles that are not our "essence". Colwin has shown me that those parts of us can grow together and let us be as brave and as open as our past selves. The added plus is that all of us who imagined (?imagine) a life as a back-up singer for any musician can feel a little less crazy 
 Awesome! Although it's been more than five years since I read it, I always see it on my bookshelf and ask myself if I should read it again. It was one of those books, especially for baseball fans like myself, that I never  wanted to end 
 The Headmaster to aspiring galoots.  Explains basics of pre-WWII woodworking in Britain and America 
 I met NSN through Bill Moyer's The Language of Life series and have been a fan ever since.  She is a poetry superstar, but she's not the sort of poetry superstar you'd put on a pedastal.  She's the kind you'd invite into you kitchen to talk about current events on a truly fundamental, human level -- over a cup of Turkish coffee.  As a poet, I truly appreciate the fact that so much of her poetry is about words, the power of simple words, the systematic public abuse of common words.  As a Lebanese American, NSN helps me to look on the Middle East at one remove, like her, and with compassion.  Her poetry shows why, if we have only one thing clutched in our hands at the very end of everything, it should be our basic humanity.  Now, wouldn't you want someone like that to talk to in your kitchen over coffee?  In a conversation that would be all poetry, no less 
 I purchased a refurbished Tungsten E over three months ago and it has been working fine. Like the other reviews state, there is a small noticeable whine depending, strangely enough, on how far away you hold it from your head and on which side. I'm the type to get easily annoyed at small noises, but the whine hasn't really bothered me. Please note that I use my Tungsten E primarily as a Chinese-English dictionary, so I keep it at home plugged in to its charger most of the time. I do take it with me sometime, but not very often. The screen has had heavy use from writing in Chinese characters, but it still works fine. Overall, I am satisfied with the quality of this product considering its low cost these days. However, I would also like to mention that the buttons on the Tungsten E were not built for gaming(should you decided to install any games or emulators) - the function buttons aren't very responsive now and require very hard pushing 
 this book is very god because it has creative monsters in it. And also a lot of templents. Well worth the price 
 An excellent book in the vein of the creative memoir, reminiscent in this way of Karr's Liar's Club.  Historical fiction at its best.  Occasionally, however, the book feels a little Rocky Balboa, i.e. too epic and romantic in the self-heroizing of the narrator to be completely credible.  One thing that is never explained is why the Red Guards would go to all this trouble with her, trying to get her to confess, when they were essentially not accountable to anyone for their actions and could just as well have taken her out and shot her if they felt like it, or those they seem to want her to betray.  She seems to have some secret knowledge that they in fact won't do this, which she doesn't share with us, which takes away a lot of the boldness and daring from her standing up to them as she does.  It's great Count of Monte Cristo stuff, but there seems no good reason for all the care they take with her, instead of either shooting her or just locking her up a la gulag and throwing away the key.  Unless of course the Red Guards were really as retarded as they seem in the book.   
 This is one of the great American books. The scion of one of America's most patrician families tells the story of his education. And his education is the story of his disillusionment with the time and world he comes to live in, and his idealization of a long lost medieval world. The Virgin of the medieval Catholic vision which represents for Adams an organic harmony is opposed and contradicted by the Dynamo of his own world. And that Dynamo is of scientific and technological progress accelerating at such an intense pace that the sense of the world, the center falls apart . And the Adams born to the heart of America's founding elite feels himself increasingly not at home in the world. The majestic tone, the third person narrative, the whole detached way he tells his own story prevents the reader from the most intense kind of sympathy with him. And yet his vision of a world somehow come apart in going too far and too fast in directions we do not understand does speak to us today.  There are of course other aspects of the richness of the work, including the insight into the political worlds of the Washington of his time.  But there is too a sense of an elite observer for whom the America of successive waves of immigration is not the real America . And there is a sense of Miniver Cheevy child of scorn cursing the day that he was born, of that is the ' old- line aristrocat ' who feel these new and other Americans have stolen his home and place from him.  This is a work which much can be learned , and which certainly has much to be admired in it intellectually. But it is not a work nor is it written by a person , that warms the heart, moves and inspires. 
 Tautly written, with great character development, near-science fiction was fascinating projection.  Main character has Tourette's Syndrome, which alone makes novel stand out.   But when dark things start happening around an ancestral home, there come interesting Jungian twists and reflections 
 The Waste Lands, the third novel in Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is by far the best volume yet.  This volume picks up a short time after the end of Drawing of the Three, and we see Roland training Eddie and Susannah to become true gunslingers in Roland's world.  Soon into the novel, the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World, a huge cyborg bear, who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds.  Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam, and if they follow the beam, it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower, they just don't know how far away it is.  As the three gunslingers start to follow the beam, we, the readers, are taken to our own world and reintroduced to Jake, the ill-fated child from The Gunslinger.  Jake is currently having a mental breakdown (as is Roland) due to the fact that Roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a Cadillac in The Drawing of the Three.  One part of Jake tells him he should be dead, the other says he should be alive.  Jake's mental breakdown leads him on a journey across New York to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book, and in this house, Jake believes he can get back to Mid-World and be reunited with Roland.  The final part of the journey in The Waste Lands, takes our group to a city called Lud, on the outskirts of the waste lands.  The group believes they need to find a monorail named Blaine in the city, and he will help them on their journey to the Dark Tower.  Once they enter the city, much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool, but really evil character called the Tick-Tock Man, who runs Lud.  All of this leads up to a ridiculously exciting conclusion and a killer cliffhanger that makes me really glad I waited to read these until they were all published.  As far as action and suspense goes, The Waste Lands takes the cake easily from the previous two books.  Most of all, this book makes us appreciate the character development from the previous books.  We care so much about these characters, and would be devastated if anything were to happen to them.  This book also goes a long way in providing some much needed answers about the Dark Tower in general and Mid-World.  These answers are both satisfying and frustrating.  They are satisfying that you aren't completely clueless as to what is going on, but there are deeper answers to everything that we are given in this novel, so it just makes you want to read on more.  The series just keeps getting better as it goes along 
 Often one wonders whether film is nessicary, whether one can tell a better and more absorbing story through writing.    400 Blows is the film for me that shows just how absorbant a film can be, just how a film can take the viewer inside a world and feel more real than a book.  This film is still as fresh and revolutionary and sad as it was when it premiered at Cannes in the 60's and changed the world of cinema forever 
 An excellent source of information for those of us considering homeschooling.  Wonderful insightful comments form other parents who have found themselves in our same positions.  I was pleased to find the resource information so helpful and in one location!  I recommend this book as reference source for anyone considering homeschooling 
 Yo all of you who keep dissing this series and comparing it to GOSSIP GIRLS -- kinda makes me wonder if you don't work for GG or something.  Both series are good and quite different!  What A LIST has that GG doesn't is heart, sincerity and depth.  You know, those things that we actually CARE ABOUT.  This is the best A LIST yet, full of surprises.  A very cute girl is staying at Ben's house, Anna hs to deal with her own jealousy and insecurity, and learns a lot about herself, and about Ben, along the way.  Cammie gets shocking info on her mom's death -- murder?? -- Sam breaks Eduardo's heart, Dee gets sprung from the hospital for prom and falls in love, and lots more.  I simply could not put this book down, and I read 'em all.  You will love this book, that's the truth 
 The use of linear perspective in art can be traced back to Brunelleschi's now lost panels depicting the Baptistery of Florence and the Palazzo Vecchio (1425). Brunelleschi observed the buildings in a mirror and attempted to capture this plane representation faithfully. Edgerton spends much time trying to reconstruct these "demonstrations". The basic ideas of linear perspective were soon afterwards applied by Masaccio in his Trinity fresco and by Masaccio and Masolino in the Brancacci Chapel frescoes, and became widespread after 1435 when Alberti wrote the first text on linear perspective, the Della pittura. Allberti says: "I decide how large I wish the human figures in the painting to be. I divide the height of this man into three parts ... With this measure I divide the bottom line ... into as many parts as it will hold." Then we fix the "centric point" (the observers straight-ahead point on the horizon ). "The suitable position for this centric point is no higher from the base line than the height of the man ... for in this way both the viewers and the objects in the painting will seem to be on the same plane. Having placed the centric point, I draw lines from it to each of the divisions on the base line." Through the centric point we draw the horizon. "This line is for me a limit or boundary, which no quantity exceeds that is not higher than the eye of the spectator ... This is why men depicted standing in the parallel [to the horizon] furthest away are a great deal smaller than those in the nearer ones, a phenomenon which is clearly demonstrated by nature herself, for in churches we see the heads of men walking about, moving at more or less the same height, while the feet of those further away may correspond to the knee-level of those in front." Next we learn the "costruzione legittima" construction of tiled floors, although the fact that construction lines typically need to be extended off-canvas seems to have caused some confusion. As examples of early uses of Alberti's text and somewhat unsuccessful costruzione legittimas we study two drawings by Bellini and Pisanello, where "the original perspective layout constructions can still be seen under the finishing ink". These artists "seem to have followed Alberti's instructions to the letter---to the best of their understanding". As for the reasons for the popularity of perspective, Edgerton emphasises religious motives: "perspective rules were accepted by ... early artists because it gave their depicted scenes a sense of harmony with natural law, thereby underscoring man's moral responsibility within God's geometrically ordered universe". "Linear perspective rules themselves had to be modified of even abandoned if they conflicted with the pictures true purpose in this sense", as we see in the case of a Veneziano altarpiece, which violates perspective laws and has the centric point at waist level. We next study how linear perspective was influenced by the science of optics. There is of course the notion, in Alberti's words, that "a painting will be the intersection of a visual pyramid". Light rays from the periphery of the pyramid need to travel longer to get to the canvas so "they weaken and lose their sharpness", Alberti explains, and "the reason for this has been discovered: as they pass through the air, these and all other visual rays are laden and imbued with lights and colors; but the air too is endowed with a certain density, and in consequence the rays get tired and lose a good part of their burden as they penetrate the atmosphere. So it is rightly said that the greater the distance, the more obscure and dark the surface appears." Edgerton also cites an optical analogy in Dante that "upholds the wisdom of looking someone 'straight in the eye', with all its overtones of detecting another's truthfulness and communicating one's own sincerity" as an illustration of why Renaissance artists preferred the central viewpoint where walls and floor tiles tend towards the centric point in the middle of the horizon. "During the fourteenth century there had been a temporary favoring of charming oblique views. Thereafter it was as if painters wanted to recapture the solemn spirit of the old traditional Christian messages" and "came more and more to believe that things planned or seen from a central viewpoint had greater monumentality and moral authority". Next we study the influence of cartography on linear perspective. Edgerton make a big deal of this, but many connections with painting seem quite superficial, such as a Giotto painting that appears conformal but not distance-preserving and the supposed influence of latitude-longitude grid thinking on Alberti's gridded veil method and Uccello's chalice drawing 
 Not much was left out. This is a great collection of Elton's public and personal hits without buying every album.

 Our 23-month-old toddler is absolutely OBSESSED with cars and anything else with wheels.  Ever since we got this book, it's the only one he wants to read!  Wonderfully detailed, humorous, and entertaining.  A definite classic and one of the best items we've ever purchased for our son 
 I read about Lila Downs' new CD, La Cantina, in Victor Cruz- Lugo's article entitled, "Sweet Sorrow," published in the June-July 2006 issue of Hispanic Magazine (page 76).  It is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on Lila Downs' new CD, La Cantina:  1.  The CD cover is awesome, a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating  Lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock.  It strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time, awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song.  2.  Each track is a lively composition of Mexican corridos and sones impregnated with Lila's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family.  3.  I first was introduced to Lila Downs and her musical talent when I enrolled in writer Juan Felipe Herrera's legendary Manikrudo Summer Arts class at Cal State Fresno in 2000.  Juan Felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice.  Later that night we all saw her in concert at the Tower Theatre in Fresno and I've been a fan of her work ever since.    4.  This new CD is indeed a delightful experience.  I appreciate that she moved into the corrido, son, etc. genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more.  It has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious.  It's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity.  I think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of Lila's work.  She is a true artist.  I've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two CDs, however, this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience.  5.  I am very impressed with Lila's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000.  There seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon. Ahua! Her solos in "Yo ya me voy," have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity.  As Victor Cruz-Lugo writes, "Through it all, Downs' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart, tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same."    This is my favorite of Lila's repertoire.  It is my opinion that those who purchase this CD will not be disappointed.  Enjoy!          
 This is a wonderful country-rock type album with a heavy Neil Young influence. Moorer's voice is sexy and bluesy and glides effortlessly over crunchy, hot, yummy guitars. A seriously melancholic thread weaves its way through every track, (w/ lyrics like "The cuckoo clock quit chirping/The bird fell out and died/Spent its whole life working/And never learned to fly/It ran out of time."), which is very much to my liking.  Also recommended: Anne McCue's Roll. She's an Australian femme w/ serious electric guitar chops. 
 Just to state the fact that The Boxer:  Family Favorite won the Dog Writers Association of America award as the Best Single Breed Book of the year 2000. This book is THE definitive in-depth study of the breed by someone who has spent her whole life living with and loving Boxers. The color photographs are outstanding 
 This book won't tell you how to play guitar, or how to change your playing to make you a better guitar player, but it will tell you how to change your thinking to set those other steps in motion.   This book will change your perspective toward guitar and life, giving you the insight you need to set yourself on a path to better guitar 
 As a child I LOVED this book and read it several time 
 This book may be a bit dense to get through, but it is packed with fascinating ideas and highly worth reading for anyone interested in the evolution of the human brain and its relationship to the evolution of human culture. Donald's grasp of anthropology and cognitive science make this book an excellent introduction to what's going on in that field. But what makes it especially deserving are his own contributions, particularly his ideas on how written language and "the external storage of ideas" have allowed the brain - and culture - to make quantum leaps forwar 
 I am a (successful) practitioner who has been exploiting mispricings in the market for more than 10 years - in bad times and good times.    This is an excellent book - readable, comprehensive, and up to date.  It is not a fool's book but the ideal book for an intelligent person. It describes the risks associated with each strategy.  I particularly like the strategy with Fidelity Select Funds.  I hope the book becomes popular so that it can be reissued every few years with new insights and new data.  
 This book will enable me to answer my grandchildren's questions of what happens to frogs, toads, bees, field mice, to name just a few, in the winter. Mr. Heinrich stuck to the subject and churned out the information; information that satisfies the reader who requires a certain depth of explanation for biological curiosities. The depth in this instance would be Biology 101 at most universities. His writing style is informative and not condescending, I enjoyed the read, it had more human interest tucked in appropriate places than most textbooks.  
 Dan Tow has created a marvelous resource. With complex queries, it is often uncertain what is the best query plan. Dan Tow takes the mystery out of that process. He details a methodology that will give you the best query plan with a high degree of certainty. He also provides insights into how to achive the desired query plan 
 I wrote it once and I will write it again: the perfect novel is one that combines literary aspirations with an engaging plot, thus mixing the high-brow (the tone) with the low-brow (the cheap thrills of a great best-seller). Arturo Perez Reverte has by now carved a career out of this thin balance, being the master of the so-called literary best-seller. "The Queen of the South" is a brilliant tale about a memorable character, a narco's morra (girlfriend) who is forced to escape her native Mexico and then turns into a drug-lord of her own. She's a complex, intriguing character, obviously not free from many ambiguous facets. The tale is gripping, believable and, as one has come to expect from APR, very well written. Highly recommende 
 I was looking for a nice dress watch or might I say my wife wanted me to look for nicer dress watch.  When I scolled down to the Kinetic Coutura Watch #SNP008 on Amazon's web site, it blew my mind away. I went to a local jewery store and viewed one in person, then ran back and ordered it from Amazon! It's a beautiful watch, very expensive looking, but without the cost!  I was debating between  a Rolex or this Seiko Kinetic Coutura and I choose it, and I'm glad.  It looks just as nice for thousand of dollars less.  If you don't wear it every day it will stop, but I like the way the time and date adjust with just a couple of shakes.  It brings a smile to my face each and everytime I put it on.  I have had numerous compliments from friends and they all guess it cost a couple of thousand dollars.  When I tell them the cost, they can't believe it.  If your looking for a beautiful dress watch, this is it! Amazon's price was the best 
 This is one of the best foreign language dictionaries I have used.  Each word entry is filled with example usages and phrases, each shown in both French and English.  This is very useful because it goes far beyond the basic meaning of a word and allows you to see how to actually use it, and therefore also understand some of the subtle differences in its usage as well.  There are also lists of idioms that use a particular word.  This has also proved to be very useful, since foreign idioms can sometimes make little sense if you translate them literally word by word.  I liked the print version so much that I also purchased the software CD version.  My French girlfriend and I would spend hours talking on the phone with our Oxford Hachette programs running so we could look up a word in a second or two and hardly slow the conversation down.  Highly recommended 
 At a lunch with a studio executive,screenwriter John Dunne was insisting on a story point in the script that he had written with his wife,Joan Didion, the excutive mimed reaching under the table and bringing out,"The Monster",their money, to win the argument. Seven or eight years they toiled on the script that became ,"Up Close and Personal",this is the chronicle of their experiences. Fascinating and sobering, when you realize how things can dissolve and then reappear in a completly different form. It is very well told and forshadows his health problems that cost him his life in 2003, that his wife wrote so exquisitly about in "The Year of Magical Thinking". If how movies get made is of any interest to you this and his other film making tale, "The Studio" will fascinate you. 
 Beautiful documentary, very well done.  It was interesting to see Gilmour, Waters & the gang discuss how they went about putting together one of the greatest albums ever.  I also appreciated the additional commentary from Alan Parsons (who actually plays the soundboard in the film) and Rolling Stone Senior Editor David Fricke who discloses many facts about the band and the production of the album itself.  This is a must-have for any aspiring musician or recording artist, or any fan of Pink Floyd 
 I LOVE this book. It's filled with wonderful creative and inspiring ideas. I bought one for both of my sisters too! 
 Not only does Swedenborg's Heaven & Hell provide rational answers to the question, "What is this life and this world all about anyway?" but it also gives us the combination to unlock the door to happiness.  What's more, one of Swedenborg's central statements is that EVERYONE may choose to enter into heavenly happiness.        This is incredible!  The choices we make in our daily lives, whether from loving or hateful motives, are an expression of the ultimate choice we will make about what kind of place we wish to dwell for eternity.  The further implications of this idea is that as we form our lives by the choices that we make, we can choose to become more and more "heavenly happy," right here, right now, if we apply the ideas in Swedenborg's book to our lives today.        I found these concepts to be inspirational and informative, a book that could be read over and over, always discovering some new gem of wisdom 
 "It would carry off objects of which it grew fond, And protect them by dropping them into the pond."  This quote sounds like British humour to me --- however these are the words of the American author Edward Gorey.  This entertaining tale of a creature that arrives at a family's home one day is very amusing because of its strangeness.  Each little episode is a description of a strange little event precipitated by the "Doubtful Guest" done in rhyme.  It begs comparisons with Dr. Seuss, but it is a more sophisticated, darker humour, that is more suitable for adults.  Accompanied by Gorey's own ink drawings, this book is a classic.  Although it will only take a few minutes to read it, you will enjoy re-reading it many times 
 I gave one to my son who is a math teacher and he hasn't put it down since Christmas.   The green laser is visible when pointed at something half a mile away and it's cool to see the beam all the way if there's anything in the air for the light to bounce off 
 I've read Sarum, Russka, London, and now The Forest.  Although Sarum is still my favorite, I have thoroughly enjoyed The Forest.  Rutherfurd has a way of making history live through multi-dimensional characters ... in a very Micheneresque way.  I highly recommend The Forest, as well as his other works 
 Though this book was written close to 40 years ago, and though Rossiter knew nothing about the Kennedy assasination, Watergate, or Vietnam, this book makes bold predictions about the future of our country and our  presidency with surprising accuracy. The book is written sometimes in a  conversation-like tone that makes for easy reading, and the author (while  incredibly knowledgable) makes no effort to talk over the readers head. It  is a bit old though, and the type of analysis Rossiter uses (namely a  constitutionalists point of view) is out-dated. However, it is an  optimistic and inspiring book that every future president should read 
 I like the book but will probably not make most of the projects. Overall it gives lots of good ideas for chain mail jewelry. If you are interested in chain mail I recommend it as an addition to your library 
 Receiving this album is like opening a christmas present in the mid summer. If great songwriting is your thing and you love sweet melodies, then Daniel Wylie is what you need. This album is filled with beautiful songs that sound like his Cosmic Rough Riders work on Enjoy The Melodic Sunshine. It is more of the same as that disc. You will love 'Define Love, 'Move In With Me' and especially 'I Wouldn't Lie'. tThis is the stand out song among many great songs. Please buy and enjoy. I enjoy it 
 I love this book! I have been using it for about 10 years and wanted the new edition. The author explains the energy-based philosophy of Eastern Nutrition in a clear, understandable way. I love the explanation of grains and their value, how to transition to a mostly vegetarian way of eating, fasting, juicing, and so much more 
 The Creature from Jekyll Island is a superb writing about Money , Banks , Senators , White house and the creation of the Fedral Reserve of the United States of America .  No investment banker affords to miss this book which is like the Bible of creating Money out of thin air and out of nothingness .  The book is not available on the bookshelves easily  but you quickly get it from Amazon at a very reasonable  price .  Go ahead all the guys from Ivy League schools , other schools , institutes , financial services guys , bankers , economists and Governments , World bank , U N officials and grab this gem of the book world at Amazon .

 I found this book to be an excellent resource.  These two authors have written two other incredible titles which I also recommend: 'Positioning: The Battle for your Mind' and 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing'. This  book ties in with these two and builds on them.  The information in this  book is quite useful, and the authors give great examples that illustrate  their point.  I found this to be an easily understandable text that was  immediately useful.  This book covers important tools such as monitoring  trends, focusing your product line to claim a niche of the market and  exploit it ahead of your competition, as well as how to build a successful  marketing program with a sound foundation and carry out its successful  execution.  A lot of great basics are included here 
 It contains no nudity, cursing, or extreme violence. It's silly, politically incorrect.  It's F-Troop, a TV show from a simpler time that a family of all ages can watch and enjoy together. If commercials from the era F-Troop was filmed were included on the DVD, I would have given it 5 stars.  
 This rack was very easy to assemble. The unit is very stable and moves very easy with the wheels. It will hold lots of clothes and is not under any strain to do so. I would recommend this to anyone needing additional hanging space 
 If only the rest of his solo career had built on the promise of this jazzy masterpiece....  For some reason (probably because Columbia's A&R guys told him to), Loggins teamed up with Bob James who produced (along with Phil Ramone), arranged and staffed the album, and the results are stunning.  The song mix is perfect, the groove shifts from ballad to pop to shoop-shoop, yet stays within a range of common appeal that makes the whole seem greater and more thoughtful than the sum of its component tracks.    Loggins can write when he wants to (and when he is not working out his realtionship therapy on disk like so many of his recent works), and his songs played by the likes of Eric Gale, Lee Ritenour, Harvey Mason, James, Hiram Bullock, Robben Ford, and other "jazz planet" guys of the '70s sound fabulous.  And the album is so well engineered that it sounds arguably better on LP than on CD (something you analog audiophiles can verify).  Even if the words "Kenny Loggins" cause the post-disco, movie-soundtrack bile to rise in yor throat (a widely-held, but I think unfair, sentiment), anyone who is a fan of contempo jazz vocals must give this album a try.  It is almost 30 years old and it still holds up, in the timeless way that really good music should.  It is one of my true Desert Island disks, and it might become one of yours, too 
 If you are even remotely interested in world affairs, and more particularly the Middle East and Arab/Israeli relations (the fact that you are reading this review places you squarely in this category) you will no doubt one day find yourself involved in a conversation regarding the Arab/Israeli situation.  As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, you will doubtless be deluged by some well intentioned but misinformed individual who will make it their temporary mission to witness their personal plethora of misguided notions about Israel upon you. This one single volume will arm with the knowledge to debunk their barrage with cold hard truth.  In just over a half century, Israel, as a subject, has been the recipient of more negative misinformation than just about any subject one can conjure up. Mitchell Bard has assembled a sourcebook that will set the record strait, annihilating years of misinformation and downright propaganda against the Jewish people and their national home.   Bard assembles 26 chapters, each covering a specific time frame, area or event, and each chapter addresses numerous myths of the related topic and proceeds to present the reader with the cold hard truth.   The book by itself, is a good read, but afterwards serves the reader as an incomparable sourcebook which you will refer to many times. The layout makes enables the reader to easily navigate to the specific subject one wishes to explore. The book concludes with 100 pages of appendix, which contain the relevant documents and agreements of Israel.   This will be an invaluable addition to your library. Read this book.  The next time someone attempts to force feed you their anti-Israel agenda, fight back with the truth.  Monty Rainey www.juntosociety.com 
 Schickel is one of the few film critics of any authenticity; he certainly has credentials, having written about film for Time magazine, having directed, produced, and written screenplays.  He writes knowledgably about the controversial Kazan, but is perhaps a bit too partisan to his politics.  It's good to explore that area of controversy, but Kazan seems to be much too determined to exculpate Kazan during the HUAC hearings.  Still, anyting Schickel writes is worth reading, and arguing about 
 "Red Shirt and Black Jacket" by Virginia Lanier-  Two robbers kill a convenience store clerk and the police send Jo Beth Sidden, Jasmine Jones and their bloodhounds to scent out the killers.  The dogs steal the show in this exciting mystery that has a very big chase scene.  "Nightmare in Nowhere" by Chasse West.  Duke the German Shepard wakes A.J. up by licking her; she carefully gets out of the backseat of a car that looks like it is going to drop into a deep river.  She has no idea where she is or why she was in the car or who was the driver.  The dog takes her to Jake, a police officer vacationing in Maryland but he has no phone to call for outside help.  Jake tries to help the amnesiac but someone keeps shooting at them forcing them to run from the cabin.  Chassie West has written an exciting tale with realistic characters.  "The French Poodle Connection" by Lee Charles Kelley.  Former cop turned dog trainer detective Jack Field is at Cady Clark's home teaching her dog not to bite people when her ex-husband turns up with a gun because he just robbed a bank.  Cady gets the gun after Jack knocks her ex unconscious and holds it on Jack forcing him to go to a deserted area while she frees her ex.  This is the beginning of a crime spree that ends with four dead, five if you count Cady, who Jack doesn't because he believes she is alive.  Lee Charles Kelley has written an entertaining mystery filled with twists and red herrings.  The Case of the London Cabbie by J.A. Jance- Septuagenarian Maddie Watkins plans to prove that the twenty nine year old man her sister loves is a con artist after her fortune.  She hires him under a false name to drive her around to look at properties that supposedly belonged to her later husband.  Catching him in many lies, she follows him in her car only to be threatened by him when he catches her and her sister becomes his hostage.  JA. Jance has written a fantastic mystery with a heroine who deserves her own series.  Harriet Klausner 
 You may not use ALL of the ideas in this book BUT if you find just one that helps you - then it is worth the investment. I believe each one of John Maxwell's types of thinking that are identified and briefly explained could be individual books all by themselves.  The thing I appreciated most about  "Thinking For a Change" was that it gave me "just enough" of what I was looking for.  My suggestion is to read "Thinking.. " then pick the area you most need work on and delve deeper with other resources. Reading this book, gave me one key concept on strategic thinking which I was able to immediately apply to a business issue I was trying to figure out for the last 18 months. It made the difference in how I saw the problem and gave me a tool to successfully analyze it and ultimately move through it.  Whether you are in business or not, if you are looking for a fresh idea  - this book may just get you started on that path, if you let it 
 I used to read this to my kids when I was a children's librarian in an African-American school in Detroit, and they loved it.  It has such amazing, beautiful pictures- you can't really understand their beauty until you see the book in front of you.  And of course, the speech is incredibly moving.  Here is the full text of the speech, but since there isn't too much on each page, and there is such beautiful artwork to enjoy, even 4th graders could sit there in awe at what was read to them, and what was shown them 
 A must have resource if you are at all concerned about toxic ingredients in cosmetics!  You'd be surprised 
 Once again, as with 'Pirates of the Caribbean', Klaus Badelt has written an awesome action score for Wolfgang Petersen's 'Poseidon'. The only problem with it is that there is considerably less of the score than I would have liked to see. The movie is about 90 minutes long, so where is the rest of that score? The actual CD is only about 40 minutes long and 3 of those songs are from the party scene. I expected those songs to be included but the score is what I'd liked to have seen more of. Having said that, Badelt's work is well tuned to the events in the movie - sharp percussion punctuating the score as the ship is rolled upside down by the rogue wave, and brass crescendos as the survivors make breakthroughs in their attempts to escape. Brass & strings also portray the grand ship 'Poseidon', as it glides along the water in the opening sequence - an apparent mastery of engineering & technology. Highly recommended 
 Not as good as the first movie but still funny. All new material, fast paced and as usual, only people with a good sense of humour will really appreciate the combined talents of these 3 comedians 
 This is about as good as this type of travelogue-book can be. Miller combines solid leg-work with intellect and compassion, and gives an accurate overview of Cuba today. I recently travelled to Cuba and I read  Miller's book twice, once before I went and again after I returned, and it  was worthwhile on both occassions. P.S. I also read MIller's "The  Panama Hat Trail," which was equally informative and insightful 
 Forget the fancy stuff - this is all you need to teach your child (or anyone) to read.  We do two lessons a day (or more on the easier lessons), about 20 minutes per day, and my daughter was reading simple sentences by the third week.  Talk about motivation!  Unlike some programs, this moves quickly enough to keep the child's interest and allows enough diversity of information to give the child real skills that he/she can put to use NOW.  Don't waste your money on games and such--just Alpha-Phonics and pen and some paper will make your child a reader 
 I read this book for a book report, and found that it was extremely interesting. While a bit dry at times, it got very interesting around the time at which she was getting the book published. I highly recommend this book for Harry Potter fans, and for teenagers needing to read biographies for book reports 
 Hi;   Whether you are a beginner or experienced magician, you will find a wealth of great magic in these books, especially if you enjoy the subtle (sneaky!) instead of complicated sleight-of-hand 
 All Together in One Place is a wonderful story.  The characters are well developed and the plot has many twists and turns to keep you wanting to find out what's going to happen next.  Wonderful story.  Could hardly put it down.  Highly recommend 
 When you look at all that Oprah has achieved, considering where she came from, it is simply staggering. And then to think of all the good she has done and continues to do! Promoting literacy, making people feel good about their appearance and promoting civility and kindness- all good stuff! She even gave a car to every studio audience member once!  I don't always enjoy her show- sometimes it is too much for the "ladies" or it is just to promote Tom Cruise or such. But other times, she celebrates her good friend and sister Dr. Maya Angelou or some other notable figure, and Oprah really shines.  I also enjoy Dr. Phil's advice. And he shows that Oprah isn't playing the race card.  This book is full of great advice and a lot of funny stories. This is a great gift for a special lady, and the man can enjoy it too 
 I found this to be exciting reading.  Its premise is that much of the pain we suffer is the externalization of unresolved emotions.  This may seem simplistic, but as an MD I'm interested in new approaches which can help me help others.  I have seen a pattern developing among quite a few of my patients in which what goes on in their bodies mirrors, with a predictable time lag, what has been going on in their lives. I have seen it often enough to make me take notice when I came across this book. This is important reading for everyone who want to get a handle on chronic pain.  I have had lower back pain for many years and this book helped me to gain much insight into my own condition.  I would also recommend the DVD Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond. Between this book and that DVD, my lower back pain is totally gone 
 This book was the best book i ever read because.....It is very funny .I would recomend it for kids my age because at this time in life you start to think im not in preschool anymore i dont have to share and it might make them feel greedy.This book teaches kids not to be greedy because somtimes it turns out bad. 
 The rack went together w/o any problems & is serving its purpose very well.  The written directions were VERY poor; however, it wasn't rocket science & went together easily 
 I bought it for my three year old son, and I can't express how much joy my little one has every night when he goes to bed, he immediately runs to bed and literally ask my wife or me to start reading. I highly recommend it for all the little ones!! ! !, you won't regret it 
 This is a book that needs to be read both by those who are interested in the relations between races in this country and those who think they are not.  It is a scholarly but easily readable and compelling description of  the insidious effects of race in the administration of criminal justice in  this country 
 A fascinating story from a most unique and compelling perspective.  Suskind's style is suspenful and depth-charged with threads of intoxication woven thickly.  Some might find his style overworked or redundant but to me its more suspensful and greatly described as you're tremendously anxious to found out whats around the next corner.  It might take some time to warm up to his translated language but once you do you will make it your own as the story is hauntingly original; a sheer masterpiece of literature 
 I like science.  I like bicycles.  This book goes into much greater depth than most people will want.  I couldn't even finish it.  If you build bikes and/or are a physicist or engineer and like biking then you will probably enjoy it 
 Emanuel Swedenborg lived the last 27 years of his life interacting and dialoguing with angels.  In this day and age "angels" have become very popular.  I have visited stores where everything that is sold has to do with "angels".  The popular TV show "Touched by an Angel" and also "Miracles Do Happen".    Having been raised a Roman Catholic the fact that I had a "guardian angel" was never far from my consciousness.  It wasn't until I was 30 years old that I realized the impact of my "guardian angel" when I was pregnant with my daughter Lisa and waiting to deliver.  A few nights before, my "guardian angel" came to me in a dream and told me that all would go fine.  I was under complete bed rest, my doctor was concerned and this powerful dream came at just the right moment.  Swedenborg had many experiences, in the company of angels he visited heaven and hell.  His book "Heaven and Hell" gives you detail explanations of his encounters 
 If your looking for "Darker" vampire erotica then Love In Vein is your book. Some of the stories such as "White Chapel" are a bit graphic, and border on B movie gore, but overall it's a worthwhile read. It is certainly not a book for the "Timid."  
 If you're wondering that this is going to be just like the regular Rugrats you see on T.V., think again!  "Tales from the Crib" gives viewers a new twist on their favorite babies and childhood fairy tales.  Taffy, the Rugrats' babysitter, tells the stories to the babies, who give it their own Rugrats twist.  In "Snow White", Susie plays the title character, Angelica (of course) plays the evil queen, and the babies along with Spike play the seven dwarves.  This is a very good direct-to-DVD movie and will probably never air on television.  This is very hard to find in stores and is not available to rent.  Also, this DVD features two episodes of the Rugrats spin-off, "Pre-School Daze", which has not yet airred in the U.S.  Those episodes are very fun to watch and the theme song is very catchy.  I would reccomend this DVD to anyone 
 This book is a must have for any user of Photoshop both amateur and pro. It covers a wide range of topics including raw format, color correction and the bridge just to name a few. The examples and concepts are provided in a great amount of detail so you never get lost. The author will walk you through each and every step of the process and explain alternatives to complete the task. Source material is available on the provided CD for a majority of the tips, tutorials and some extra content like Actions.  If you are a photographer by day or just like to shoot for fun then this book is for you. Colin really knows how to cover a topic in great detail and without all the fluff you find in most books. A few of the chapters are devoted to specific additions to CS2 which is great to get up to speed on the new features such as the bridge or the new and improved photo gallery. I give this book a 5 out of 5 and the reason for that is because the content is relevant, to the point and it is nice to get some sample source to work with 
 While nothing can capture the intensity of the book, the video is a good effort.  It quickly engages you in Ursulla LeGuin's imaginary world 
 We love Illy coffee but it is difficult and expensive to find in our area.  When I found it on the Amazon web site - WOW!  About half the price and delivered right to my door - and quickly!  I surprised my husband on Christmas morning when he found the can sitting next to the coffee pot.  Excellent 
 Last year I decided to stop collecting Barbies I was very disapointed with the big headed dolls that were showing up like the Cali girl, fashion fever ect  now I see that these celebrity dolls have the regular head size I was very pleased this doll is so pretty although she doesnt have the exact likeness I still think she is OK the outfit is wonderfull and has a pretty hair Mattel please stop making bigheaded Barbies and keep  making pretty dolls like this one dont mix MYSCENE with the regular doll line 
 In October, 1859, a small group of young Republican leaders in New York City invited Abraham Lincoln to give an address at Henry Beecher's church in Brooklyn on a subject of Lincoln's choosing.  At the time, Lincoln was heavily involved in helping Republican Congressional candidates, was still smarting from his 1858 defeat for the Senate by Stephen Douglas, and was a dark-horse, favorite son for the Republican presidential nomination. Lincoln accepted the invitation, worked painstakingly on the speech, and travelled to New York City to deliver what became the Cooper Union Address on February 27, 1860. (Lincoln was unaware that the venue for the speech had been changed until he arrived in New York.)  The speech and its aftermath brought Lincoln national attention.  It played a major role in allowing Lincoln to overtake the Republican front-runner, Senator William Seward of New York, and secure the nomination and the presidency.  Harold Holzer is an independent scholar who, in the midst of a busy career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has written or edited over twenty books about Lincoln.  His most recent book: "Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that made Abraham Lincoln President" (2004) is a comprehensive account of the "momentous" Cooper Union Address, including (p. 1) "its impetus, preparation, delivery, reception, publication, calculated reiteration, and its enormous, perhaps decisive impact on that year's presidential campaign." It is one of a number or recent books that examine in detail a specific Lincoln speech or proclamation, (such at the Gettysburg Address, Second Inaugural Address, Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln-Douglas debates.)  But the book does more.  It helps the reader understand Lincoln and the issues that lead to the Civil War.  The Cooper Union speech was lengthy, scholarly, and factual and endeavored to show that a majority of the founders -- those that signed the Constitution -- believed that Congress had the right to regulate and prevent the spread of slavery into the territories.  This issue was central to the dispute between North and South and to Lincoln's debates with his great opponent, Senator Douglas. Holzer's book begins with a discussion of how Lincoln, the self-educated backwoods lawyer and stump speaker carefully researched this issue in an attempt to present a dispassionate yet morally committed approach to the issue of slavery.  The book includes excellent accounts of the difficult and tiring nature of train travel during Lincoln's time, especially for an aspiring presidential candidate travelling to make a major address.  It includes fascinating discussions of the New York City of 1860 --Walt Whitman's New York -- and its docks, piers, hotels, and Broadway.  There is a wonderful account of Lincoln's visit while in the City to Five Points -- a notorious slum -- and a letter he subsequently received in the presidency from young men in a charitable school that he visited at the time.  While in New York, Lincoln had a famous photograph taken by Matthew Brady. Brady's artistry made Lincoln look distinguished and presidential rather than like a tall, gangling shabbily dressed backwoodsman.  The Brady photo together with the speech helped bring Lincoln to public attention.  In the heart of the book, Holzer offers a detailed analysis of the Cooper Union speech (the text is given in an appendix) and of Lincoln's delivery that fateful evening.  Although his audience was initially taken aback by the rough-hewn Lincoln, the substance of the speech and Lincoln's style of his delivery captivated the audience and made an astonishing impression.  Lincoln helped shepherd his text into print, and made  a hectic speaking tour of New England while visiting his son Robert at Exeter, thus furthering his position as a statesman of vision, integrity, and prudence.  An interesting feature of the book is how Holzer reminds the reader of the fragile nature of historical accounts, including alleged eye-witness accounts.  Many times, Holzer points out a received account of the Cooper Union speech and shows in detail how the account is questionably supported or is inconsistent with other sources. (For example, there is a story that Erastus Corning, Director of the New York Central Railroad offered Lincoln the position as corporate counsel following the speech for the large salary of $10,000.  Holzer shows that this account lacks foundation.)  The book shows how historical sources need to be approached, used, and interpreted with caution.  This book is an outstanding account of Lincoln in his complexity as a pragmatic, opportunistic and yet highly principled leader.  It gives a vivid picture of our country and its political life in 1860.  It considers issues about the nature of the Union and of human freedom that Lincoln addressed eloquently. These issues remain with us today.  Robin Friedma 
 Mitsch and Gosselink have written an excellent text/reference book on wetland ecology and management. The book is perfect as a text for a wetlands ecology course in upper level or graduate courses. I use it as a reference that I pull from the shelf again and again 
 Risen's excellent book is essentially a series of lengthy newspaper stories (Risen, of course, writes for the NYT). No doubt some of the things he reports here will be expanded upon or revised. Indeed, the recent USA Today story on the NSA's large-scale data collection program is a follow-on to Risen's work. Risen paints an ugly picture of the way things work in Bush's administration; Cheney and Rumsfeld dominate, Rice gets pushed aside, Tenet was a lap dog, and Colin Powell was sadly irrelevant. It's difficult to tell whether Bush is the leader or just gets pushed along. The book details a number of distressing stories; take your pick: domestic phone-taps, ignoring contrary evidence on WMD in Iraq, kidnapping targets and flying them to secret prisons (euphemistically called 'extraordinary renditions') and more.  Two things struck home. When the spies were caught spying on American citizens in the 1970's, there was bipartisan outrage, thorough investigations, and new laws. They had the decency to be ashamed. Not so today. My conclusion after reading this book (and watching the goverrnment in action over the last half century) is that whatever surveillance the government is technically capable of doing they are doing, we just don't know it yet.  Tremendously important and interesting book. I thought the book was so important I gave my copy to my local library. Must read 
 Reading another customer review I was forced to write my own for the first time! I couldnt disagree more strongly - this is a great movie and a wonderful presentation from Mondo Macabro. In reality this movie isnt a giallo in the classic sense ( maybe why some folks dont get it) - Cozzi subverts the genre he knows so well from working with Argento - and creates a tense thriller much more in the mould of Hitchcock's Frenzy than the multiple murder pile up we're used too. Our concerns are for the killer more than the victims which creates an unease whilst watching that I really enjoyed. The movie comes in a stunning cinemascope presentation, with a great pounding score - loaded with three (!) featurettes but by far the best extra is the fascinating commentary track - its like a masterclass in thriller making - Which is good for me 
 Calder covers what can be a dry subject in an interesting manner. He follows the history of consumer credit from the early 19th century up to the period of the New Deal.  The book discusses the evolving attitudes toward credit and debt and the products that eventually revolutionized the system of consumer credit.  It is well documented and illustrated.  A surprisingly good read for what can be a boring subject 
 Excellent movie! Great sound effects! Depth charges shook my room. If you want a good movie to show off your audio gear, this will do it 
 Those of you who have read Rand Johnson's "Arcadia Falls - A Fable" will find interesting parallels here, albeit in a Victorian idiom, as Hudson presents a moving and mysterious romance against a backdrop of great natural beauty, in this case the South American jungle 
 The movie I felt is better than the first one. It will appeal more to the grown ups than the previous one did. This time you will get crazier adventures of Scrat the squirrel. I got the region 3 dvd and it was ok nothing special. Cannot comment on the region 1 dvds. The film on the whole is enjoyable if watched once (max twice). I felt Cars was technically far better than IA 
 This is a good start.  In its sheer breadth of knowledge it covers a vast array of questions from pre-emptic strikes to the status of civilians and the question of responsibility.  WOnderful discussions on all aspects fo waging war from blockades, to the question of appeasement.  A very fascinating read with several minor flaws.  THe first major flaw is the preoccupation of this book with western conflicts.  Major wars, with millions of dead, have been waged in this century alone that did not involve the west, for instance the Iran-Iraq war.  Little analysis in this study is given to the question of a non-western perespective on war and what it means for western nations confronting non-western ones, who live by completely different rules.    THe second major flaw is the all to often obsession with treating terrorism without mentioning Islam.  In the chapter on terrorism and guerilla war their is a disproportionate focus on the IRA and the 'Stern Gang' which would make one assume that these organizations were disproportionatly good examples of terrorism.  The opposite is true.  Not one sentence, in fact not one word in this study deals with Islamic terrorism, which just happens to be the main confict in the world today.  THe question of 'just wars' was obviously aimed at the recent Iraq war, so why not deal with the question of Sept 11?  FLaws such as this point to an overreaching political correctness which takes away from this volumnes very heroic attempt to understand modern war.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 I am not much of a war buff so I had doubts about reading a book about war.  The main reason I read it was because I was born and raised in New Jersey and love George Washington.  Ketchum satisfied both aspects - he explained the entire 1776 retreat through NJ and the subsequent attacks on Trenton and Princeton, while at the same time conveying the predicaments that faced George Washington and, in turn, his ability to overcome the continuously difficult situations he was in.  At first, I thought the book would only discuss the battles, but Ketchum provides excellent insight into the main characters of the battles with interesting footnotes that inform the reader of where many individuals find themselves in the future.  The book is both expansive and readable - a fabulous combination 
 Just discovered this CD and had to go see them spin. Im amazed well worth your time. They do not let you down at all...totally chill 
 I've read many recently published books on the substance and meaning of the Catholic faith--Weigel, Groome, Greeley, etc.  I've also read recent books by and about John Paul II, and Cardinal Ratzinger (Benedict XVI).  And, lots of historical, even famous, books of Catholic theology and apologetics: Newman, Chesterton, Merton, etc.   Lots of those books were very good, and each in their own way added a dimension to my own understanding of a faith I love.  But, David Scott's Catholic Passion is the single best book I've ever read on Catholicism.    I cannot say I actually learned anything new (other than a few interesting facts about some saints I had not met before).  Rather, Scott captures the richness and joy Catholic life and belief, and with an easy prose encourages in the reader the attitude that a right understanding of Catholicism should inspire in all of us.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to discover or rediscover what it means and how it feels to be a Catholic.  It should be required reading for everyone involved in an RCIA program.  Catholics should buy a copy for their Protestant friends who may think (or are even sure) they know what Catholicism is about.  Mail a copy to that relative who has left the church.    To be sure, this is not academic theology, nor a catechism lesson.  It is the inspired work of an author who loves his church, and who has found a way to communicate the best elements of that church, and his faith, to his readers.  Scott's book is the most honest and joyful expression of the faith in print today 
 As David Catrow tells us in his introduction, "...For me, the Constitution is a kind of how-to book, showing us ways to have happiness, safety, and comfort...", and he uses his immeasurable talents as an artist and cartoonist to teach an inspirational and unforgettable lesson that is sure to open interesting discussions at home and school.  Following a glossary of what the actual words in the Preamble of the Constitution mean, (e.g. "IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION:  To come together and make things better for everyone who lives in our country.  INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY:  To make sure we can all have a nice life and get along with one another.  TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY:  For kids, parents, other grown-ups, and all the people born in our country after we are."), Mr Catrow details the meaning of these important ideals, phrase by phrase, using his marvelously bold and busy cartoon illustrations.  Each two page spread is a clever feast for the eyes, rich in engaging details, manic energy, and droll humor.  Perfect for youngsters 8-12, We The Kids is a witty and memorable treasure, and one of the real winners of 2002 that shouldn't be missed 
 I did not want to watch this movie that my retired husband thought was so great.  I humored him by sitting down to watch it this evening and have to say that it is one of the best movies I have seen in some time.  We both get dismayed by the fact that some very good movies get overlooked or unnoticed because of the Hollywood politics or whatever. We are not all that consumed by special effects and the glitz that is so much a part of some of the prominent films released.  Anyway, this movie is fantastic and I will think about it and ponder it and love it long after the next Mission Impossible or whatever declines in popularity. It is a worthy movie and a "must see" by adults who can appreciate a good story, movie, without being inundated with special affects and hype.  Truly a good story and movie. 
 The sub-title of HAW!! is "Horrible, Horrible Cartoons.", which pretty much serves to warn away the easily offended. Brunetti serves up 90-some odd (Very odd...) 1 page gag strips that read like "The Far Side" on crack. No topic is taboo, but if you're open minded, and looking for a LOT of laughs at everyone else's expense, HAW!! should fit the bill. Fans of Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, Richard Pryor, et al, will find Brunetti's subversive humor to be a perfect counter-point to the misplaced political correctness of the day. I can't rave about this book enough 
 This book is wonderful. I felt like I was there at the Mysteries while I was reading this book. It's so good to see something else Pagan,yet different out there that is not the same old BS of "cast your circle this way..." I like change & so this was a new way for me to celebrate the Wheel of the Year in a different light. Ms. Reif gets you involved making masks,head wreaths,and even gives you help if you want to grow your own wheat. This book was like a breath of fresh air ! HYE! KYE 
 I HAVE BOUGHT 200 OF THESE JEWEL CASES AND NOT ONE OF THEM HAS FAILED. THEY SHIP QUITE RAPIDLY EVEN WITH FREE SHIPPING. THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT AND IF YOU READ MY REVIEWS YOU KNOW THAT I TELL THE TRUTH AND DO NOT HOLD BACK WHEN A PRODUCT IN MY OPINION IS BAD. I HAVE HAD POOR RESULTS WITH DUEL JEWEL CASES IN THE PAST. NOW I CREATE MY OWN USING THESE JEWEL CASES AND COUPLING TWO OF THEM BACK TO BACK USING SCOTCH MOUNTING TAPE. TRY IT AND YOU WILL APPRECIATE THIS ADVICE I'M GIVING YOU RREE OF CHARGE..    
 excellent content.   rather hard to read due to the font size 
 Blood Meridian is a dark, violent, and painful novel about the American West in the 1850s. It is about humanity and our sad capacity for violence

 "Remember the ladies" Abigail Adams charged her husband John -- that's what Nagel does with "Mary Nisbet"; she fills in  fascinating and colorful details of the world of the women of society in England during the war against Napoleon. All the teasing glimpses we get in O'Brian's masculine epic are fleshed out, as it were; the opulence of the Bey's court; Emma Hamilton's manipulation of Admiral Nelson; the impact of the war with Napoleon on life and travel --  all the dinner parties O'Brian glossed over in passing come springing to vivid life as we read from Mary's actual letters.  If you loved Master and Commander or the whole series, pick this up and treat yourself to a richer picture of the period 
 Robert Schimmel cracks me up. I laugh the loudest in comedy clubs when he comes to town, so I just had to get the CD to listen to -- when I'm at home... alone... behind closed doors so other people won't know what I  think is funny...  It is impossible not to quote Schimmel at just the right  moment... he has such attitude! He's my favorite comic, and I just heard he  has a new show on FOX TV this fall! Buy this and laugh the WHOLE time 
 Chico's Groove and One Too Many Mornings make this cd.  Without them it would be a good cd, but with them this cd is great 
  This well-researched book reveals China as an awakening giant, experiencing roaring growth and impressive technological advances. Not only does the country have the unrivalled productive power derived from its huge low-cost labour force but its one billion plus consumers have made it a lucrative market.   One of the reasons for its breathtaking economic growth is that rural people have been moving to the cities in large numbers. Three of the most interesting chapters are titled The Revolution Against The Communist Revolution, Pirate Nation (which examines the problem of counterfeits and brand theft taking place in China), and chapter 11: The Chinese Century.   The author examines the implications of this rising colossus for the world, and for the West in particular. What if China manages to produce everything that the West does at half the cost? And at the same time as its industrial and knowledge economy is booming, the country is aggressively pursuing reliable sources of raw materials and acquiring foreign companies.   Its geopolitical influence is increasing, as is evident in its potentially dangerous friendship with Iran (as part of an Asian Economic Co-operation Group that includes Russia), and its growing influence in Africa (especially Sudan) and even in South America (Venezuela).   Time will tell if the Chinese economy is inherently sound and how far the country will take its alliances with rogue states like Iran. China's involvement in the Middle East might prove its undoing. The book provides all the latest statistics and plenty of intelligent analyses. It concludes with Notes, a Bibliography and Index.  
 I've been following Liquid Soul 5 years now. I first saw them at The Double Door in Chicago's too trendy Bucktown. Since then I've seen them evolve into serious acid jazz band. I wish they would do more stuff like  Dysfunction and Stop By Monies. Simone kinda gives the group the same soul  that Maysa Leak gives Inconito. Let her do more.. 
 Has some good tracks. Very motivational music. Would suit the one with a good imagination. Just hurry up and buy the dam thing 
 My experience using the TracFone has been good. Coverage and connections are not a problem 
 No, this book is not for someone who wants lively light entertainment, and it is not a 'travel' book. What it is is a lovely woven cloth of experience and observation. It's subtle and beautiful. 
 This was an album eagerly awaited for and boy have they come through! Everyone is a winner. I can't really say that I have a favourite because they are all great! A good mixture of love songs and rock, Robert Lamm must be congratulated for 'come to me' which I think should be released as a single. 'Where were you' is very catchy and finishing the album off with the 'brassy' version of 'Feel' did it for me. Come on lads! don't keep us waiting too long for the next one! 
 Ok.  I'm a big Sublime fan.  I have All their cd's but the acoustic one, but anyway, that's not the point.  I'm a sucker for live records, and this one is one of thier best.  There are a lot of bootleg live albums on the net, and they have their moments, but the sound quality is hard to handle cuz alot of them suck.  This is a very good cd.  It shows sublime in their true form: "three guys and a dalmation playing reggae and punk songs at parties for beer" to quote, incorrectly, but close enough, the liner notes of this cd.  If you are a Sublime fan, get it.  Otherwise get 40 oz. To Freedom and s/t.  This is a good mix of songs from 40 oz. and Robbin' the Hood.  Speaking of which, it does Robbin the Hood justice because they do actual full band versions of the home-produced 4-track songs that were usually just Brad by himself.  Highlights include "New Thrash", "Don't Push", "Let's Go Get Stoned", "Greatest Hit's", "Date Rape", "STP", "Pool Shark" (which is a mix of the original and acoustic versions), and an early version of "Caress Me Down".  Good Luck 
 By now, every book reviewer has heaped cartloads of praise on "Christine Falls," the neo-noir thriller set in 1950s Dublin and Boston, by literary writer John Banville, slumming under the name Benjamin Black. And it's deserved praise.   This is a taut tale of the pathologist, Quirke, who investigates the death of Christine Falls, a young woman recently deposited into the care of his office, and uncovers black threads that link his family to disperse orphan children to the United States, only to be reclaimed as adults to become future nuns and priests for the Catholic Church.   Like most noir heroes, Quirke is a broken man. He had been salvaged from an orphanage by a high-ranking official, and ended up courting for the man's daughter. Losing her, he marries her sister, whose death in childbirth plunges him into the grey shadow world of sorrow and mourning. He drinks too much and thrusts himself into his work ("In the pathology lab it was always night," Black writes, "This was one of the things Quirke liked about his job.") When he's at home with the dead, he's plagued by guilt over the love for the surviving sister, and suspicious of her husband, who, to complete the circle, was caught altering the files on Christine Falls.  The reader feels the dread in the very first scene, where we watch a baby girl handed off to a woman charged with conveying her to a nunnery in Boston, and it doesn't let up. Dublin in the 1950s is as tailor-made for the noir world as the Hollywood black-and-white movies from the same era. Despite occasional "beams of sunlight falling slantways," the town is coated with dank with the chimneys "dribbling smoke." Even the weather is in on the conspiracy: "A gust of wind caught the skirts of the detective's overcoat and made them flap around him like furling sails, and for a moment it was as if the man inside the coat had vanished, vanished entirely."   In this environment, it's no surprise that everybody Quirke meets seems electrified with secrets, fears or a poisoned malevolence. The only innocent within sight is the infant, and we dread her fate.   Banville is a highly regarded novelist (his previous book, "The Sea," won England's Man Booker Prize in 2005), so it's easy for the genre reader to be suspicious of his motives for crossing the invisible but bright line. That concern evaporates when it's clear he treats the thriller genre with respect. There's no condescension in the plot, no wink of the eye, and his sentences retain their power to convey original sights and sounds. Even the act of sitting in a bamboo chair can be charged with tension: "The cane crackled like a fire of thorns under Quirke's weight." This was not a book dashed off to meet once-a-year deadline (or, if it was, he's a more intelligent and talented writer than we give him credit).  But despite the tenseness, there are also moments of good desire and transcending beauty. The white-trash villain, Andy, who goes along with his wife's desire to adopt a baby, drives a truck, in part because he appreciates driving at night:  "There was only him and the road and some heartsick hillbilly on the cab radio twanging away about hound dogs and lonesomeness and love. Often, standing in the forecourt of a deserted gas station or stepping out of the late-night smoke and fry smells of a roadside hamburger joint, he would feel the breeze on his face and seem to smell clean, sage-scented air coming to him like a message just for him all the way from out West, from New Mexico or Colorado, Wyoming, maybe, or even the high Rockies, all those places he had never been to, and something would well up in him, something sweet and solitary-seeming and full of promise for the day to come, the day that was already laying down a thin line of gold on the horizon before him."  As in all good noir, the happy moments are few and far between. Discoveries are made, pain is inflicted, and at the end, even bringing the truth to light does not resolve all troubles. But it also means that a sequel is in the work, and it's one that's avidly awaited. 
 Better than I expected, this is (for my money) TNT's best ever production.  It worked as a mini-series.  As a movie, it is LONG (over three hrs) and absorbing.  If you like great courtroom drama, here it is.  Brian Cox is fantastic as Goering.  The rest of the cast -- esp. those portraying the Nazi war criminals -- shine like stars.    
 Comming of age in the 80's is getting made fun of lately, but I thought it was a good time to grow up with the exception of the advent of AIDS. People were dieing so fast and I lost teachers to that.  It was not like today. This movie is really good and in the 1980's style.  It is a great comedy.  If you like the 80's and want to understand some of the refrences in the media where they keep saying Bueller repeated times see this movie.  You will also get to see where the guy who does the clear eyes comercials go his start in this movie.  Anyway perhaps you just might like the 80's if you do not already if you watch some of these good comming of age movies and listen to our music 
 I have wanted this Cd for so long and now I own it. He has a voice that is realistic and isn't fluttered with pointless lyrics and pitches. The lyrics are amazing and can bring a tear to your eye.  For you cats out there this will help you realize there is more to this man than just a play called Rent. Don't get me wrong though I love rent and I own tick, tick...Boom as well.  J-san  
 This was originally a chapter in the excellent Project Twenty series on television 45 years ago. It is a magnificent look at a decade that included the depression, the Roosevelt years, the labor strife, and the gathering storm clouds in Europe. Beautifully narrated by the the most mellifluous voice of Alexander Scourby. The last five minutes while Scourby narrates the end of an era over images of the 1939 New York World's Fair and the music of the "September Song" is overwhelming (especially for anyone over 70). There isn't any television like this nowadays. A treasure 
   What a well-written book! It reads like the memoir that it is, and memoirs require special storytelling skills when they cover an entire 50 years.  And this is what the book does--covers 50 years of the author's life and Rwandan history.    The way the author describes her friendship with Dian Fossey, her marriage to Kenneth, the people she met and shared her home and land with, and the circumstances of ethnic strife in Rwanda are incredibly touching and fascinating.      The author moved to Rwanda in the waning years of colonialism.  At first, it appeared like this unique lifestyle of privilege the colonialists lead will last for a very long time--yet it seemed to vanish overnight.  Most of the author's friends were killed or lost everything when the Congo (now Zaire) and Rwanda made their transitions to independence.       From there, Rwanda seems to have a bright enough future as the government invests in environmental and educational progress.  However, all the while displaced Tutsi refugees were fermenting across the border in Uganda, Burundi, and the Congo.    As war and revenge tears apart the progress that's been made since independence, the author struggles to maintain her humanity, home, farm, and physical safety. Like so many people, she lost nearly everything in the genocide that occurred in 1994--many of her workers and friends, all her possessions--even the plumbing was ripped out of the walls of her house.  Not to be daunted, she rebounds later that year by remaking her farm into an orphanage.    This book was an amazing look at the struggles, triumphs, and tragedies the Rwandan people faced over a span of about 50 years.  It helped me understand the transition to independence and the genocide so much better than news reports.  The author tells the story in a refreshingly human light--helping imagine what it might have been like 
 i never thought this guy was actually making a prediction i just thought it was a fictional story based on revelations....lol.....it is a bit of predjudice and racism in here but it was entertaining 
 This device was exactly as described and fulfilled it's function properly.  Installation was as simple as expected 
 This book would be fantastic if I would still run an older release of the SQL server ... and the stored procedures part is still very relevant. The XML and HTML parts (where I've expected most) unfortunately do not cover the new abilities of the SQL Server 2005, so I guess we just have to wait for a new release of this book 
 A delightful little book waiting to be enjoyed by fans of the Bronte sisters' after they have read their more famous books. Not as sweeping a story as Tenant of Wildfell Hall but deserving in it's own right. Anne is a new discovery of mine and I like her just as well as Charlotte and Emily! Her style of writing draws you in. At the end of Agnes Grey, she writes that she could go on further but will end the story here. I found myself wishing she would go on further. 
 I don't think I have heard a more beautifully uplifting CD ever.  All tracks are wonderful but my favorite being "Magnificat". The Crouch End Festival Chorus can not be surpassed; truly an extremely talented group.  Having loved the gone and mystical Latin mass, this reminds me of how very much we Catholics miss.  Bravo to Paul Schwartz on this truly magnificent work 
 You would think that by now everybody would have learned. You would think that the '87 crash taught investors a lesson and you would certaintly think that the Clinton Bear Markets followed by the Big Crash in 2000 would have really taugh everybody a lesson. What lesson? Every expansion is followed by a crash. Everytime. It happened in 1927 and as already mentioned, it happened in '87, there was the Asian crisis and two bear markets in '97 and '98 and then 'buy and hold' investors really got wiped in 2000  I am all for the stock market. I am invested. But I am not a 'buy and hold', listen to my broker and cross my fingers type hoping for the best. Robert Kiyosaki is not bearish on the stock market either. He is only cautioning people on what is going to happen again when the baby boomers retire. And just for your information, it has already started. The first leg of the baby boomers are already retiring or retired.   Rich Dad's Prophecy is not a 'Doom and Gloom', the world is crashing type of book. But it does offer words of advice on how to prepare for the coming crash.   Kiyosaki indicates that there will be another major bull market first and others such as Harry S. Dent have predicted the same thing. Dent predicted the 1990's boom  before anyone else and the subsequent bust that came in 2000. Dent has predicted another bubble that will take the Dow to as high as 40,000 and the Nasdaq to 13,000 by late 2009 or early 2010. But guess what is going to follow that expansion?  I highly recommend reading Rich Dad's Prophecy, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing and The Next Great Bubble Boom by Harry S. Dent.   Remember, hope is not a strategy!  
 Although I can't comment on the return of several main characters, I did enjoy this book a lot.  I was not familiar with Maura and Jane, as I've only read a handful of Tess Gerristen's novels.  But, I thought both characters were rich and quite life-like.  Dr. Maura Isles did not have a huge part in the novel, but she was still a powerful character.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jane Rizzoli.  Her dedication as both mother and cop was great.  The plot of Vanish was also quite good.  A little bit of murder, kidnapping, deceit, government cover-up, and the terrible world of young women sold for sex all mixed into one very entertaining novel.  It was hard for me to put this book down every night or at the end of my lunch break.  I wanted to get to the end, but at the same time did not.  I highly recommend this book, as well as any work by the author.  Her writing is very readable, and her characters rich and believable 
      I've read this book at least 3 times, and I came back to buy a new copy because the one I have is SO worn, underlined, written in, the cover is missing, in short- at times in life- it's been truly a life-line, a friend, and what has taken my hand and pulled me through.       The first time I read it I was in my late 20's, feeling direction-less, kicked around, and not at all sure of how to take the reigns in my life. This helped. I read it, I "Talked back" by writing in the margins, I answered the questions at the end of the chapters, and I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I had been focusing much/most of my life, my goals, my plans- on trying to please others, trying to get approval, because of things that happened when I was too young to even see that it was impossible to please those I was trying to please- anyway! I learned that I was working hard for things that I was "supposed" to want- but actually- I didn't really want them. I re-grouped, and spent some time adjusting, and was able to find a new level of comfort and happiness.       I did not give up trying to feel pretty, I did not stop wearing makeup (By the way... just making note of earlier reviews)       I read the book again, several years later, in my 30's... as I started FREAKING about aging, and this time, I saw that all her quotes by others about aging- where the SAME things I was thinking! PHEW, I was not alone! This is SCARY STUFF!! All these "Oh My GAWD... It's too late to do this, it's too late to do that...Maybe I'll never be a superstar!!!(Oh no, Maybe I don't WANT to be a superstar!)" and this book helped to debunk that... Thank god!  And Now, I just finished reading it, because I'm looking for new dreams, now with my children leaving home for college... And I'm sending copies to my siblings and friends.       ~~~~~ Buy this book if you are 20, if you are 30, if you are 40,50 or 60. Buy ANY of Barbara Sher's books, She is an Excellent, Educated, Brilliant, Motivational Person, with a LOT to offer- and She does not have that "Anything you dream, you can have" attitude. She's realistic and concrete and sane and rational.       A real 5 Star Read!  
 To call Stan Brakhage's work an acquired taste is to rather underestimate the challenge, and to say that he was ahead of his time is to apply common language where uncommon language is needed. His films are still ahead of their time, they were outside time, they may well have not had a time, and this documentary is a timely introduction and overview of his life and art for a new generation. I watched it and then immediately purchased the expansive Criterion collection of his work, and any documentary that makes you want to immediately explore the subject further has done its job. This documentary does it job, quite admirably 
 ... even if you're a big leo kottke fan from 20+ years ago. as a guitarist, I like to listen to guitar music. I really don't like kottke's singer/songwriter material. there's nothing wrong with it, but it's just not my "thing." I've listened to leo kottke albums off and on over the years and this is the first one that I HAD to buy the second after I heard the last note of "the bristol sloth." I see a lot of complaints from other reviewers that kottke keeps "tuning down" his guitar more and more with each successive album. I rather like it. there are VERY few solo guitarists that can keep notes and passages audible and controlled while playing a guitar in the register that much of this material is written and recorded in. it was this that really grabbed my brain as I listened to the album - and I'm a big Michael Hedges fan... hedges used a lot of low register tunings (although admittedly not as low as some on this album) and often there would be so much information being conveyed in his solo pieces that a lot of it would get lost because it tended to run together into one single sound. what's so amazing about "try and stop me" is the clarity with which kottke pounds all these low register notes out of his guitar. (...and could the title also be a message he's conveying to his long term fans who don't want to hear him depart from his 30 year old material...?) The main reason I like this album so much is probably because I'm a relative newcomer to leo kottke in the fact that I'm not already a big fan... and also the fact that his guitar tone is quite comparable to being hit in the face with a prison pillowcase full of unopened soft drink cans.... if you love solo guitar music and can appreciate leo kottke's more experimental side, this is a fantastic album 
 This book is a classic of investment in stocks.  Everyone who wants to invest in stocks should  read this book , it is the bible for amateurs  and persons who already have stocks ,  thank you Peter Lynch 
 The World is running out of oil. This book gives the reasons why that is happening. Demand is up, production of existing reserves in the U.S. hit it's peak in 1970, we are getting less and less production from the world's existing reserves with each passing year, and the prospects for finding new oil as we have done in the past is dim. Hope is found in the "Tar Sands" of Canada. Alternate sources of energy - especially wind power - must be developed.    
 I would've given this collection five stars if it weren't for the last four songs. I'm something of a purist when it comes to the Mills Brothers and much prefer the "four boys and a guitar" style of their early  work. On songs like "Paper Doll", and "Across the Alley from  the Alamo" the brothers sound fantastic. Unfortunately, classics like  "Glow Worm" are lost amidst the sound of the big band behind  them. The version of "Cab Driver" on this album is apparently  from their "country" period. I preferred earlier versions much  more. The album is worth buying for the first seven songs alone, but look  elsewhere if you want to hear the rest as they should be done 
 I loved this book.  I found that it's something so new over the past few years, as far as something that people talk about.  We've come so far relative to diversity, acceptance, and sharing our personal stories, that a book like this is a breath of fresh air.  I'm happy that it talks about things from a child's perspective, and doesn't try to be too clinical or matter-of-fact.  My children loved the book (they're teens....and I'm a gay dad) and it put all of the challenges, blessings, and difficulties into perspective for them.  We're all walking a different path, and it's great to see what others (and their children have gone through. 
 In this short work by Manly Hall, he digresses into the little known subject of how the ancient masters of the mystery schools go about teaching their students. Much has changed in the way of secret societies since the days of Plato and Pythagoras, however, the principles are generally the same. Silence is still of utmost importance. In the times of Pythagoras, silence was not only a virtue, but something your life depended upon. Today, you will not get crucified or burned at the stake for revealing secrets from a society, however, your integrity and Will are disseminated. Silence today stands as a virtue more than anything, but one that most people neglect. This short book also looks into the practices of the Student, Disciple and Initiate, as the basic three grades of the practitioner once they have entered a mystery school. Even today all of these attitudes that Hall speaks about have complete practicality in today's culture. It is less about environment and more about the demeanor of the practitioner. If one does not take in all of the ideas represented in this book, surely one or two of them will cling to the readers mind as not only possible, but inspirational. For those that have been practicing the secret arts for a period of time, this book may serve as a good reminder of why they are doing what they do to begin with 
 Contains three classic TYA tunes- Love Like a Man, Working on the Road and my favorite- 50000 Miles Beneath My Brain. Buy this CD, along with Live at the Fillmore East and hear even better versions of these songs live 
 Reissued as a paperback in August 2006, The Partner leads the reader on a roller-coaster of emotions in a fast-moving plot.  In what I consider John Grisham's best work, there really aren't too many heroes to be found in the manipulative world of the news media, politics, finance and law.   The story is pushed along through the retelling of facts through a variety of transcripts. It works, since none of the characters could be "trusted" to tell the truth to another individual. Simply, documents don't lie, people do.   Everyone has a price to sell out a colleague or loved one; but the person seemingly most manipulated turns out the winner in the end.        
 I spend most of my time as a photographer taking macro photographs of flowers and other small things in nature.  I chose this lens over Canon's 50mm macro and 100mm macro for two reasons: (1) it is constructed with higher quality UD glass, so it has great color and contrast, and it's incredibly sharp at all f/stops, and (2) at 180mm, it allows you to stay farther away from your subjects and still focus to 1:1.  This makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects and it allows you to have a smaller, more blurry area in the background so that the background doesn't compete with the subject for attention.  The lens also comes with a tripod color, which allows you conveniently change from vertical to horizontal, and it adds stability with your lens better balanced on your tripod.  The lens has an ultrasonic motor, so it's fast and quiet when focusing, though I highly recommend setting the focus limiter 1.5m-infinity when not shooting macro photography.  It will speed up the time it takes for the lens to focus.  The only drawback I can find with the lens is that it is constructed with only an 8 blade aperture diaphram.  Theoretically, with a higher number of blades, it would allow more natural blurs, but I can say I've never noticed a problem in my photographs 
 Another excellent album from Groove Collective.  If you like groove, funk, hip-hop, acid jazz, and all around talented musicians you'll love this band 
 "RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL"  REVIEW:  In 1985, the P.M.R.C. (Parental Music Resource Center) which was formed by the wives of Washington politicians came before the Senate demanding that the record industry - like movies - use a rating system and label each album for content. Essentially, "Raise Your Fist And Yell" is Alice's F.U. to the P.M.R.C. while lyrically and musically, this album is an improvement over his previous effort (1986's "Constrictor"). "Raise Your Fist And Yell" has three excellent tracks that round out the album. "Chop, Chop, Chop," "Gail," and "Roses On White Lace" harkens back to Alice's "Welcome To My Nightmare" days with 80's metal sensibilities.   MUSICIANS:  Kane Roberts ... Guitars, Vocals  Kip Winger ... Bass, Vocals, Keyboards on "Gail"  Ken K. Mary ... Drums  Paul Horowitz ... Keyboards   INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released in October of 1987, "Raise Your Fist And Yell" peaked at #73 on the Billboard Top 200.  2. Originally, this album was going to be called "Summer Blood".  3. At the beginning of the track "Lock Me Up," the words "Alice Cooper you have been accused of  mass mental cruelty. How do you plead?" was spoken by "Nightmare On Elm Street" star Robert Englund (a.k.a. Freddy Krueger).  4. Morbidly, 'Gail' is the middle name of Alice's wife, Sheryl.  PACKAGING:  Cool album cover and CD booklet includes the album's lyrics.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  35 min. and 35 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  'Raise Your Fist' is an entertaining 80's metal album that truly delivers in the album's final three tracks. **** out of 5.   
 This book has layed out the path for my real estate career.  I would recommend this book to anyone in the business and especially to those who are just getting started 
 I was not familiar with this book before I bought it; however, it was recommended by the teachers of the students for which this and several other Ed Emberley books were purchased. From the thank yous I have received, this book was a real hit! It is used in a Native American Mission School with great enthusiasm and even better results. What more could you ask for 
 This book is full of good, solid Bibical truths and hits on many different topics that I think most women can relate to.  It definitely gives practical and godly advice at how to find intimacy with God in everyday life.  While the book probably has a target audience for women older than myself (after college and probably women who are married and have children), it still has spoken to me.  I would recommend this book to other women as it is practical and an interesting read.  Joanna Weaver relates effectively to the audience and her voice is not a didactic or preachy.  I think she speaks from a heart that realizes the importance of seeking an intimate relationship with God.  If it is the cry of your heart to have a more intimate relationship with God in this busy world I would encourage you to give this book a shot.  Its practical and enjoyable 
 Many from the media are also compiled at the book's website chinesetao.com. Fun 
 If you pay close attention, then you can hear Lawrence Krauss cautioning you to beware of taking science as a religion. Krauss explains his own immunity to falling victim to this affliction by way of having been caught in the crossfire between the two insititutions of science and religion.  I applaud his insistence on taking the physical evidence as evidence of itself only while resisting the allure of the reported enthrallling beauty of the equations and precision in physical theory.  If the lesson comes across that it is possible to be a scientist without out being a secular religionist, then that can be realistic encouragement to future potential scientists.  Well done, sir 
 I have been blessed (or, at times, cursed) with rare insight myself, and am not easily impressed by others who claim to have it. Rob Bell, however, truly has a gift; and he is using it to call people back to their relationship with God. Rob uses simple analogies to show us how easy it is to connect with God, and he tells us it is okay to explore, test, and probe (think out of this culture's "norm"). Rob just gets you thinking, and he reminds us that God wants us to think about Him, and relate to Him. Practice makes perfect.   If we are ever to be able to discern God's unique message for each of us, it remains our responsibility, as individual's, to search for and connect with God's Holy Spirit that IS in each of us. Don't get hung up on the believing the "this and thats" of various, religious doctrines; get into the "believing IN" God, period; because God is love, and He loves us. Rob shows us the baby steps, toward the knowing and loving of God, that God has made available to us through the simple things in life. Okay, now I'm getting preachy.  The book is so good, and Rob does such a great job, that I must admit some skepticism. I almost wait for the other "shoe to drop"  (isn't that terrible of me?). I am hoping the relatively young Rob doesn't "screw" his gifts up by reading too much into his abilities, and eventually going off the deep end with the "holier than thou", I know THE Truth, type of evangelism we are all too familiar with (and have been hurt by).   I, myself, get a "high" from reading books that, though they challenge my comprehension and suck my energy, talk in depth about concepts regarding philosophy and Christology. However, this book, while not long, philosophical, preachy, or textual, has definite impact and is invigorating! WELL worth the money! Thank you, Rob! Please, keep up the good work!  
 This book is amazing, we can read about to many real points in electrical wiring, actual information help about National Electrical Code 2005. Read this book is a big step to electrical wiring 
 I really like this book...our pastor recommended it and at first I wondered how it would apply...it is a great picture of these people's transformation from negative spiritual influence to positive (i.e.demonic forces and God) and how even in the middle of the jungle God still sought them out!!! Powerful! 
 it works great, i'm using it as 2nd audio channel instead or adding a new audio adapter boar 
 THIS ALBUM IS A CLASS ESPECIALLY DISC 1. MY FAVORITE SONG IS EVERYTHING THEY OWE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE BE SAYIN. 2PAC THA TRUTH. CANT NOBODY TELL IT LIKE PA 
 I thoroughly enjoyed "Raise the Red Lantern", more so than the other two novellas. As an occidental 30-something I realize I am not qualified to judge the accuracy of the story, but I found it highly entertaining. I also liked the film version. The novella differs in creating a degree of emotion, suspense, and creepiness that the film lacks. The film is worth seeing for the setting and costumes alone.  Set in China of the 1920's or 30's the protagonist is a young woman who, due to her father's death, can no longer afford to study at the unversity. With few options available she becomes the 4th wife/concubine of a wealthy man who is plenty old enough to be her father. The "wives"/mistresses each have their own small apartment in his traditional Chinese compound. What she finds a life of boredom interrupted by plots among the other mistresses, and the slighted maid who wanted to be the 4th mistress, to eliminate each other and win favor with their benefactor. They all want to spend intimate time with the old geezer in order to conceive a son, the only way to ascend this surreal hierarchy. The protagonist manages to thwart numerous plots against her and sets out to discover the mystery of the previous 4th mistress. In the process she descends to a level of cruel that she previously disdained in the other mistresses. As with most Chinese stories, don't expect a happy ending 
 Filmed in the early 70s just past the easy rider woodstock epilogg of the 60s generation this film has a gloomy mood, kind of a after christmas depression being one of the first of the 2nd half of the hippy era of the early 70s it looks dated but i think it is intended that way and in a good way. Barry Newman is a car delivery driver after a recent depressing life of vietnam veteran, corrupt law enforcement and possible suicide of his girlfriend. The film defines the mental statis and mind racing of many vietnam veterans of the turbulant 60s and early 70s who can side with him. He is spent and he knows it so he just dont give a damm anymore hes out for his last dash. The 70 dodge chalenger he drives simblizes its last hurrahh as well as the fast car from the factory was winding down with 1970 being the last year for cars to get faster. After that year they started cutting back in the energy crisis to follow. The dodge speaks of its mopar domination being the best of the speedy cars with the hemi supercharger and pistal grip 4 speed shifter. Although some may argue the car is the star thats ok as well. It looks good, sounds good, and owns the road, well for a little while. He is driving from denver to san francisco and meets some more depressed people along the way including cops, want a be [...] robbers, a desert burned out old man, hippi cult jesus freaks, a hippi biker, blind disjocky, and the best for the guys a naked blond riding a bike who ask him for sex but in his chronic depression turns her down. He is popping pills to stay awake and does not appear to have any water in the desert as his life is unquenched and very unsatisfied. Best is the europian vergion when he picks up a girl who desires and wants him but its only a temporary feel good, its only a dream then back to his nightmare his falling apart life. They block the road with 2 bulldozers but he could have went around them. Its like they gave him a choice and the car and him are in a flash like his life and the 60s history. This movie defines the period best and is like no other and never will be like another 
 A light, fun romp with an interesting and moderately amusing cast of characters.  Sick Puppy provides the reader with a fast, action packed story that details the events of one man's obsession to save the state of Florida (specifically one tiny island) from the ravages of progress.  The story is chock full of semi-memorable characters each with his/her own hugely conspicuous character flaw.  The result is an ensemble cast of real-ish yet quirky characters who propel the story in a number of different directions.  And each direction provides opportunities to explore additional related story lines and to meet yet more unusual characters.  Ultimately all of the stories loose ends and character relationships are tied up nicely and satisfyingly as the story winds down.  The only negative about this book is that it often provided giggles instead of laughs.  It was funny to be sure, but rarely did it provide the laugh out loud moment it appeared to be leading up to.  In most situations, the circumstances and characters had the potential for big laughs but the author never seemed to be able to pull the trigger.     If you enjoy odd characters with equally odd lives and a story that provides a fun and funny twist with each turn of the page then Sick Puppy should be on your To Be Read list.  
 Some years ago I saw that a theater that played "revivals" was showing Leni Riefenstahl's OLYMPIA.  I had heard of the famed cinematographer-- whose life circumstances placed her talent in the middle of 1930's Germany. The film chronicles the famous Olympic games where Jesse Owens triumped on the world stage and Adolf Hitler dominated the political stage.  The film is long-- many many hours.  I decided to invest the six buck price of admission and just stay "for a while" to get an impression of Riefenstahls work--  I was mesmorized!  I couldn't leave and stayed for the whole thing (4, 5, 6 hours-- whatever it is).  When I saw OLYMPIA available on Amazon while looking for another film I grabbed it.  And, again-- (through the wonders of technology) I sat completely fascinated, entertained, transported by hours and hours of this film and found myself repeating sections more than fast forwarding.  It is truly a classic.  Anyone who loves film, the Olympics, history-- should see this film and have it in their collection. It is stylized, artful, beautiful, humorous-- (the equestrian sequences of people falling off horses is a riot). But I guess the adjective that comes most to mind is beauty-- the images, angles, light are magical and exciting.  At times the beauty of a still standing scupted object-- at times ballet, at times the raw excitement of athleticism and competition.  Over the years my love of film has led to the project of founding and running Scandinavian Film Festival L.A.  I know film makers, and curators, and heads of film institutes and have seen hundreds and hundreds of films-- I would recommend this film to any and all.  It deserves the name classic--   
 This is a must-have for anyone trying to write fantasy.  The book is an easy, entertaining read.  Kudos to all who contribute 
 Hardy classified THE WOODLANDERS with his Novels of Character and Ingenuity, which category included his very best novels (TESS, THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE, THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE). This 1887 novel is so bizarre, however, that you might feel it belongs more properly with his Romances and Fantasies. In the secluded rustic community of Little Hintock all manner of things are a-brewing: simple Marty South has a thing for cider-merchant Giles Winterbourne, who has been promised for years to marry well-educated Grace Melbury, but Grace's father marries her off instead to philandering Edred Fitzpiers, who has a thing for local wealthy widow Felice Charmond. In this circle of desire all manner of things can go wrong--and, this being Hardy, of course they do. Some of his wildest plot contrivances (including two bizarre scenes wherein the Widow Charmond must convey crucial information to Grace, and Fitzpiers even more crucial information to Grace's father) occur without the redeeming Shakespearean scope of a novel like THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE which allows you to overlook the wackiness. Still, even if this is lesser Hardy, it's still Hardy, so the novel has such poetically gorgeous evocations of landscape and character as to make everything worthwhile in the end 
 This book has a lot of great pictures and does a good job of providing some history on theatres that were once important parts of the landscape and are now mostly forgotten.  If you are looking for a history of the large movie palaces, there are many other books you should look at, but if you want to see a history of small town theatres with some great artwork, this is a book you need.  
 It sounds cliched but this probably isn't the best place to start with John Barnes.  He seems to excel at smaller novels, probably because he can present the idea, write an interesting situation around it and throw in some characters and jumble the plot around and everything just works out fine because he keeps it nice and simple.  When he shoots for the more complex stuff though, he doesn't make out as well.  Case in point, this here novel . . . itself a sequel to the excellent A Million Open Doors, this makes a valiant attempt to deepen and further the scenario given in that book, and for the most part succeeds.  Barnes has to be given credit for ambition, because what he attempts here is to give a in depth look at manufactured cultures and deep seated hatreds and tries to find solutions.  However his ambition tends to outstrip him here, unfortunately.  He brings back the Giraut and Margaret from the first book, now married and when the book starts their marriage is beginning to fall apart.  Again, he gets credit for broaching the subject in SF, a place generally not associated with such things . . . but he tends to beat the subject to death.  In the beginning of the book every scene they have together turns into childish bickering and Margaret is even worse . . . I don't remember her that clearly from the first book but I don't remember her being this annoying, she acts completely unreasonable, starts fights for no reason, all while a confused Giraut basically stands back and wonders, "What did I do?" . . . which is the same question the reader has.  Instead of making the reader sympathetic to their marriage, you're left wondering halfway through the book why he just doesn't give her the heave-ho (her "revelation" is blatantly to anyone even remotely paying attention and when it's revealed you want to shout to Giraut "What are you, blind?" especially since hints are dropped like every other page).  So that drags the book down a little simply because the main characters act immature but Barnes' depiction of two cultures who think they are the Universe's gift to everything is absolutely fascinating, his world building skills are in full effect and the conflicts are detailed realistically . . . it does look pretty hopeless.  It's so hopeless that Barnes nearly writes himself into a corner and winds up resorting to having the Maya create a quasi-mystical "prophet" (and that really comes out of nowhere) who preaches love and gets people to listen mostly because he's, uh, a quasi-mystical prophet.  However, unlike a lot of others who feel the ending is too downbeat, I felt it was completely realistic given the circumstances and about the only logical outcome, anything else would have required the book to be even longer (and nearly multi-generational) or devolving into a "deus ex machina" solution.  The way it turns out is sobering, but I give him credit for going with the not so happy ending (Scottish SF writer Iain Banks, also highly recommended, has a habit of doing the same thing), even if it does come off as rushed.  Still can't see why Giraut keeps Margaret around though.  Maybe another sequel will explain that one.  All told, it's entertaining, if not exactly cheerful reading and shouldn't be your first choice, go with one of his more compact works and if those thrill you, head here next.  Just don't prepare to be as delighted, even if you have to give him a lot of credit for trying 
 This is the best fantasy book that I have ever read, and possibly one of  the best books overall.  Anyone who is a fantasy reader should definately  pick this one up.  It kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the  end, where I immediately ran out to pick up "Days of Air and  Darkness" to find out how this chapter in the Deverry saga ended.   Full of action, intrige, and emotion, this book is sure to give anyone a  good read.  I am about to order the rest of the series to see what else has  gone on 
 Robert McCloskey, author of the classic "Make Way for Ducklings" is one of the greatest American children's authors. Blueberries for Sal is a great introduction to this author for the younger listener who might not have the patience or understanding for "Ducklings" or "One Morning in Maine," another beautiful McCloskey book. My two-and-a-half year old just adores this story and could hear it over and over. Here, little Sal (who is much older in "Maine") goes with her mother to pick blueberries to can for the winter and finds herself all mixed with a bear mother and child who have come to gorge themselves on blueberries. Sal's and Little Bear's frustration at being expected to keep up with their busy mothers rings true with toddlers and they adore the hilarious mother-child mix-up that ensues. Every child should read this one, if only so that children learn that people used to can their own food! 
 As a former food scientist, I found Marion Nestle's previous book - Food Politics - so right on the mark and honest.  Rare indeed in the world of agenda-driven food writing.  Her fearless approach to give you the real scoop on what is going on in the food industry made me buy this book - What to Eat - immediately.  I was not disappointed.  Undaunted by the attacks on her by the sugar industry after Food Politics was published, Ms. Nestle is here again to tell you things you should know about exactly what you are eating.  Her only agenda is educating the public and clearing up the intentional misconceptions people have about food and nutrition that are caused by the cozy relationship between the USDA and the food sellers.  In the highly confusing world of conflicting nutrition advice, Ms. Nestle calmly takes your hand and guides you through the minefield of today's supermarket, while explaining clearly how to properly interpret the studies thrown at us every day.  If you can only buy one book you really trust to navigate the modern world of food choices, this is the one. 
 Bob's book, The Novel Writers Toolkit, is a must for all writers. We use it as a teaching tool at the Maui Writers Retreat and Conference. Bob is an excellent teacher and knows his writing craft. He is also very dedicated to his students. We are fortunate to have a teacher at the Retreat who really cares about other writers and is willing to share his knowledge. He's also a very likeable fellow!  Check out his book, I think you'll love it!  Shannon Tullius 
 I have read this collection of three stories about 5 times and The stories just seem to get richer with each read. There are parts I forget or somehow overlooked that are real gems during the next reading of the story. The prose is very fine although told in a "Manly" roughness that only slightly covers an amazing level of sensitivity to the people and the setting. There are very few books that are better 
 I directed McDonagh's "The Lonesome West" for the Station Theatre, Urbana, IL, in January 2000.  (See 8am.com for reviews and links.)  What an exhilarating ride!  The new play -- like all of McDonagh's maddeningly vicious, hilarious efforts -- would be equally frustrating to stage, particularly the need for dead cats, live cats (covered with shoe polish), and other acts to drive directors mad.  ("The Lonesome West" required dozens of Catholic religious figurines to be smashed nightly, not to mention an exploding oven and on-stage rain.)  Certainly his staging challenges make these plays riveting to see, but they are equally rich in the reading.  Be prepared to laugh... and then shocked at yourself for laughing 
 The first time I read this book I was amazed and excited, and entering middle age. Seneca's thoughts on the human condition seemed like they could have been written today. Except for some dated Roman references, here is a  man trying to define how to live, in what we today would call "the  secular society." The series of letters reads like a personal  guidebook to ethics. It still speaks to us across the centuries. Seneca was  priveleged, ego centric, and all too aware of the fleeting nature of life.  He was also a tutor of Nero, a dramatist, philosopher, slave owner, etc.  But his essay-like letters - by turns glib and medatative - reveal a man  struggling to make sense of a world of power, wealth and abundance,  oestensibly ruled by reason, suffused with uncertainty and enveloped in  paganism. He was also no doubt polishing his image for future generations.  Nonetheless, he talks of god and spirituality, and the early Christians  were said to have valued his wisdom. I've read this two or three times.  Each time I've given it away to a friend. Once you read it, you'll go back  to it again and again. His maxims are famous. His commonsense advice still  rings true 
 The failure of this album boggles the mind.  Personally, I think it's fantastic.  Maybe people were hoping for a re-hash of Pocket Full of Kryptonite or something.  Well, that's obviously not what this album is.  A  lot has changed since those days, some for the better, some for the worse,  but in the end, the Spin Doctors remain a great band with a great sound.   The title song which opens the album has a lot of soul to it, and it's  unusual sound shows that the Doctors aren't afraid to try something new.   The real highlights are She Used to Be Mine (the single they  released----very funky and catchy----it should have been a hit), She's Not  You (the SD's first slow, sad, love-song.  It's beautifully written and  played, and conveys a lot of feeling), To Make Me Blue (a charged,  energetic song with great guitars), and Sister Sisyphus (a funk song that  reminiscent of some of their earlier work).  If Wishes Were Horses is also  worth mentioning.  Someone criticized it for it's goofy rhyming, but I  think that person misunderstood the song.  The lyrics are SUPPOSED  to be a  bit goofy.  It's the way the song is----a bit silly, sometimes almost  nonsensical, and just plain fun.  Also, don't forget the SD's version of  That's the Way I Like It (not listed on the album cover).  It's another  really fun song to listen to.  Actually, all of the songs are good, except  for Dogs on a Doe (#3), which was sort of lame and seemed out of place on  this album.  All in all, You've Got to Believe is something is a energetic,  funky, fun, rock album that is a refreshing answer to the SD's second CD,  the somewhat tired Turn it Upside Down.  It is yet another example of a  great work that has gone unappreciated.  The people who decided not to buy  it are missing out on something great 
 Wow... this book is unbelievable. I really liked it. It was so easy to read. Written on a teenage level. It is bad. It is just hrd to belieave what this kid Chappie aka Bone does. His adolescent life is crazy and hectic. I dont know how anybody could survive that. it was really interesting and it made me feel really bad for Chappie. His life is so messed up. It is also interesting. This is one of these books that keeps you reading because you desperately want to see what happens next. It is amazing and everybody should read i 
 The short novel Night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter, but because Elie Wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character.  Generally considered autobiographical, the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only God, but his humanity as the Nazi machine ravages Europe.  The novel itself deserves 10 stars.    However, the original translation deserves -1.  Wiesel's skill as an author is blurred by a clumsy translation.  The worst part is when the translator chose the lighthearted "siesta" as a description of Wiesel's first sleep in the labor camp.  There is a much better translation out today by Marion Wiesel, and its worth the extra few dollars.  This book is more than worth reading; buy the better translation, and you'll understand why Wiesel deserved not just the Nobel Peace Prize, but also the Literature Prize 
  Hyder is a most exceptional teenager.  He speaks English, Dari and Pashtu, and spends his summer vacations helping his father rebuild Afganistan. That he will meet his college language requirement by studying French... as though the world is crying for French translators... is only one anomaly of his eventful young life.  Hyder describes the dangerous, grinding work of rebuilding Afganistan. I hope Young (and Senior)Akbar can keep enthusiasm because their country needs them and they are in a unique position to serve.   I believe there is more consensus in the US for Afgan assistance than almost any issue out there, but Hyder doesn't encounter much reconstruction. Everytime we see the US, it's a military presence, and the encounters are less than desireable.  Failures on the micro level - Soldiers give a village a pipe so that they can build a water supply - Karsai's US bodyguards contradict him in front of others - Hyder's dad, governor of a province, close personal friend of Karsai, father of American citizens, has to be searched to enter a US military base.     On the macro level is the fate of Abdul Wali. It's unclear why he's presumed to have information or to be guilty of something. But, Adbul Wali, father of 15 children, (29 years old?) can't tell us why or how he died in US custody, setting back credibility for the US and Karsai. We meet people who lose loved ones in what is commonly called "collateral damage" or "friendly fire".  We drive with Hyder through roadless places and climb surreptitiously into Pakistan.  He recounts the nuances of the first post Taliban Loya Jirga (missling the big point the female reps).  We get insight into how a tiny country manages an international media, the appointment processes, how UN workers will accept triage in its voting registration process if local officials let them, the legacy of the comminist era, warlords and notables.  We learn how opportunitsts like Malik Zarin play the US troops like a fiddle... just call your enemies Taliban!  Afganistan only makes headlines when there is an explosion.   Where is our tax money going? What do we have to show for the post-Taliban dollars and human lives that have been spent? HOW do we support Karsai, his cabinet and his governors?  In this book, the only Americans are in the military or with the press. WHAT are they doing over there?  This book should be required reading for any soldier or official in Afganistan or Iraq and be highly recommended for anyone even thinking about nation building anywhere in the world.  
 This book makes learning grammar fun.  My daughter purchased it for a middle school student that she was tutoring to make learning grammar seem more interesting and fun 
 Marriner, a great Mozart conductor, leads the AMSF in these masterpieces. All of the recordings are wonderful with well-judged tempos. The string section of the orchestra distinguish themselves. Philips has warm sound and good liner notes. The Serenata Notturna and Posthorn serenades were love at first hearing for me, and these recordings are the perfect place to look. I don't like all of the Haffner serenade, but some of the movements are gorgeous. For the ambitious collectors, Marriner's earlier Eine Kleine Nachtmusik on EMI is even better than this one 
 I'm surprised by how many bad reviews this book received.  I am generally fairly picky about my romance novels, rarely finding any that inspire me to look for others by the same author.  However, I enjoyed this one so much that I eagerly looked for the two sequels in the trilogy.  Perhaps if I'd been more concerned with historical accuracy, I would have been disappointed with her "modern" heroines, however I found it rather refreshing to read about a heroine who was spunky rather than passive.  The hero was just dark and cynical enough that his transformation at the end was fully rewarding.  My only complain comes from looking at the book as part of a trilogy.  While I greatly enjoyed all of them, the plot similarites between the three was a little disappointing. I can't explain much without ruining any plot twists, but MacLean does seem to lack a bit in creativity.  Overall, I would say I was quite charmed and pleasently surprised by this new author.  The story was far fetched at times, but this didn't stop it from being a very sweet read 
 When Christine de Pizan wrote The Book of The City of Ladies, her intention was to defend women from attacks brought on by a popular novel called The Romance of the Rose. In TBOTCOL she defends a woman's right to education, soverienty, and justice. She brings up points such as why women are not responsible for rape, why women are equals in intellect to men, and why women are also warriors. To illustrate her point she uses for examples great women of Christian and Classical History and her own conversations with Reason, Justice, and Rectitude. Mind you, this was written some 90 years before Columbus landed in the Americas, but her message still rings true today. The translation is wonderful and accessible 
 Dr. Clarke has again crushed myths of the Atlantic Slave Trade. The number one myth is "Afrikans are just as much to blame for selling slaves as Europeans". If ANYONE has ever said this to you and you didn't tell them that was a pile of buffalo poo poo, than you need this book! If you agreed with that statement you need this book. Dr. Clarke breaks down our ways back before the trade. And the BIG differences between European & Arab slavery to Afrikan slavery. TUA NTR Dr. Clarke!!! In which 99% of the people don't know how Afrikan slave system worked. And yes where are our memorials? And the true nature of the Atlantic Slave traders is exposed in detail. Also what did Afrikans do when they found out what was REALLY going on? That answer reveals our nature and how beautiful, strong and weak we are. This books hits EVERY corner about the Slave Trade. And crushes alot of myths. Again Dr. Clarke provide a slamming bibliography. That is a library listing by itself! Every child should read this book when starting to learn our history in America. And the strategies used by both sides. I could go on & on, this book is just everything about the subject in one book 
 This is definitely an advanced book on practice.  To learn meditation out of this book is not recommended --- the author lived in the 13th century.  Reading this book gives insights, realizations, and wonderful ideas on the practice of meditation to those who have a grounding in the process.  
 In my search for a great dip book, I found it in this one. I did a lot of searching and browsing and came upon this book. The recipes are easy to make and delicious. I also like the little tidbits at the beginning of eat recipe, along with recommended dippers. 
 I preferred the series to the movie because I like the actors ( Gary Graham, Eric Pierpoint) in the series better. However anyone thinking about buying this & did not watch the series originally should be warned that it is NOT complete since the final episode ends with a "cliffhanger" that is not resolved until the 1st movie. Now if they'll just make the 5 movies in a DVD box set, then it would be complete. I had no problem with the 2 sided disks except a little bit of audio that I barely noticed 
 Ordinarily I would never have picked up a book to read that I knew was unfinished. However, I happened to see Andrew Davies' magnificent film version of WIVES AND DAUGHTERS recently and loved it so much that I went right out, bought the book and devoured it in just a couple of days. It is superb!!  Set in England in the early 1800's, the story centers around the life of Molly Gibson, a quiet, steady and sensible young woman who lives with her widowed physician father in the town of Hollingford. The two share a close bond until Mr. Gibson decides to remarry. While his new wife, Hyacinth, is not exactly a wicked stepmother, her attitude and parental abilities leave a lot to be desired. She brings along to the marriage her own teenage daughter, Cynthia, a beautiful and vivacious young woman with whom Molly immediately becomes best friends. The story follows along the everyday lives of the Gibsons as well as the local Hollingford townspeople, focusing especially on the efforts of Mrs. Gibson to marry her daughters off to eligible men. Two young gentlemen in particular figure high in this regard, Osbourne and Roger Hamley, the two sons of a local squire.   This book was serialized ( as were many books of the same era) in a popular magazine of the time and while the novel is unfinished it only lacks the final chapter. By then, it is very obvious to the reader what the outcome will be and that knowledge is strengthened by a final word provided at the end from Mrs. Gaskell's editor. He was in touch with the author right up until the event of her untimely death and he knew what she had planned for the final installment of the book. He lays those facts out for the reader so you really do get the full story, even though Mrs. Gaskell did not have the opportunity to write out the very ending in her own words.  If you're looking for a big thick wonderful saga to lose yourself in for a few days don't hesitate to pick up WIVES AND DAUGHTERS. Mrs. Gaskell does not enjoy the same notoriety as other more famous women authors such as Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters but she certainly deserves it. This story is beautifully written and an absolute joy to read! Highly recommended 
 This book is principally an examination and explanation of how the West has seen the philosophies, religions and cultures of the Far East - chiefly of China and India.  To this interest in the East Clarke gives the name Orientalism.  That word since 1985 has carried the connotation that Edward Said gave to it in his book of that name.  Though that work concerned itself chiefly with the Arab Middle East, other scholars have applied Said's characterization to the western study of cultures further East.  That school of thought saw Orientalism as permeated with condescending, exploitative and colonialist attitudes, and scarcely allowed any other factors to play a role.  Clarke admits that colonial attitudes were one aspect of Orientalism, but his study demonstrates that there were many others.  True, students of Orientalism, like students of all  other subjects, cannot help having agendas, and agendas are liable to lead to distortions. So the West's interpretations of the Orient (the word `hermeneutic' turns up with rather tiresome frequency in this text) generally fulfil some need felt by the West; but this is often not at all a need to exploit the East, but rather to gain through Oriental studies a new and enriching perspective on Western culture and frequently to provide a remedy for what are perceived to be its flaws or discontents.   Clarke argues, along with other scholars whom he cites, that in the West the Renaissance and the Reformation ushered in a philosophical restlessness and uncertainty which made Europeans be more inquisitive and open to other ways of thinking. This uncertainty was generated from within European culture,  whereas in Asia it was only when Western technology and power irrupted into the area that the interest of Asians in European culture began, in response to a challenge from outside rather than from within their own culture.  Clarke acknowledges this interest, but devotes only a small part of the book to the impact of Western thought on Asia.  He documents how in the 18th century the philosophes set up their rosy view of Confucian China in opposition to the religious and social criticisms they made of their own society; how, when this interest faded, it was replaced in the 19th century by the interest of the Romantics in Indian thought. We learn of Anquetil Duperron (1723 to 1805) who first translated the Upanishads (into French) and of William Jones (1746 to 1794), who showed that most European languages have an affinity with Sanskrit, which suggested that many of the peoples of Europe came originally from Asia.  German nationalists, resenting French cultural hegemony, preferred the idea that their culture was rooted in the Aryan languages (and later, by a perversion of the word, in the Aryan race).  Philosophically also, the most profound impact of Indian thought was on a line of German philosophers: Hegel, Schelling, Schlegel and Schopenhauer saw an affinity between the monism of the Absolute and that of Brahman, between their own metaphysical ideas that the world as we know it through our senses is not the real world and the Indian notion that we see the world only through the veil of maya.  Both Confucianism and Buddhism were seen by  many Europeans as a system of ethics which was independent of a belief in God, and was therefore espoused by many western thinkers in reaction  to the claims that religion was the essential basis of ethics.  Towards the end of the 19th century and into the twentieth, at the very time when the West's cultural imperialism emphasized by Edward Said was at its height, there was also the countervailing current that the West's cultural hegemony was increasingly questioned in the West itself; and the interest in Eastern ideas became a broad stream with wide diffusion.  Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 to 1882) and Henry David Thoreau (1817 to 1862) popularized Eastern thought in America on a scale that earlier thinkers had not been able to achieve.  Edwin Arnold's poem The Light of Asia (1879), disseminated the Buddhist message and sold nearly a million copies.  The Theosophical Society, founded by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Alcott in 1875, had over 45,000 members in 1920.  It was strongly infused with oriental ideas, and  even played a part in the revival of Hindu and Buddhist self-awareness and self-respect in Asia itself. Some Western actually thought that western civilization, with its frenetic materialism and its spiritual life eroded by rationalism, was worn out and needed to draw on Eastern thought to renew itself.  Eastern influences have moved out of the academic and literary world to permeate the very life-style of many westerners.    So Zen and Tibetan Buddhism have found many followers in the West; there are now many practitioners of t'ai chi, yoga and  transcendental meditation;  the young have gone on the hippy trail to visited ashrams in India.  From this point onwards, about half way through the book,  Clarke produces so many examples of the interaction between East and  West - on literature, on the arts, on religion, on psychotherapy, on holistic medicine, on ecological thinking, on non-violence, even on the philosophy of modern physics (though, curiously, only marginally on the mainstreams of western academic philosophy) - that a short review like this cannot do justice to them.  There was even a strand in fascism which claimed an Oriental heritage. Clarke's range is truly encyclopaedic, and in this second half of the book that there will be found much detailed material and many names that are likely to be unfamiliar to the educated non-specialist.  The mainly narrative chapters are followed by two final superb reflective ones.  In the first of these Clarke reflects on the philosophical traps into which Orientalism can fall and sometimes has fallen, but his defence of the value of Orientalism is eloquent and persuasive. In the second (more difficult) one he shows how deconstructive Post-Modernism  challenges Orientalism but can also find an ally in it 
 Having walked those streets and stayed in those types of builings recently - this movie made me think about what life was like in Budapest during those times. Schindler's list was a great movie but Wallenberg has somehow been missed by Hollywood so what we have here is a very good and unsensationalized account of a true hero. The whole story was gripping. I consider myself a student of history and truly appreciate this form realistic film making 
 I bought this book when my daughter was a one, she is now twenty-four.  This book brought us our family such joy.  Now that my children are grown, 24, 27, and 29 and the oldest is married. This book is still one of the key elements of celebration in our home.  We are on on our thrid book and this holiday season I will be purchacing three more to send home with my children.  
 This is a very good book. it teaches u how to make ice cream in several differenet ways. some of them were so good i ate at least 10 of them. this book is also good 'cause its cheap 
 I've had my eye on this for a long time, but couldn't justify over one and half thousand dollars for it.  But great news - Amazon is now selling "factory reconditioned" machines for a thousand less than the original price, and I just received mine..  It was immaculate, shipped in an original KitchenAid box with a new manual, an unopened and sealed DVD, and replacement seals.  The only apparent difference is that manual has the 2 year warranty crossed out - replaced with a 6 month hassle free warranty.  The machine looks like it is built like a tank, and my 4 year old pro-line waffle baker is still going perfectly, so it's up to you, but I can't see the benefit of buying the full price model versus the reconditioned one.  So search for "kitchenaid factory-reconditioned frozen dessert maker" and enjoy the opportunity while it lasts.. 
 If you enjoyed Ballet Shoes, as I did, you may be interested to know that on the 1950's Noel Streatfield wrote another book called 'The Painted Garden' in which some English children have to move to America. In this story of their adventures, they meet the grown up Fossil sisters. However, to get the most from this book you should have read both Ballet Shoes and Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'The Secret Garden' first. 'The Painted Garden' is not available from Amazon in the USA, but is available from Amazon in the UK.

 This is a wonderful book if, like me, you want to explore the various modern interpretations of Mary Magdalene. The author begins by showing why the portrayal that has come down to us through the centuries of a "repentant prostitute," is not substantiated by either Biblical or historical scholarship. She then goes on to explain the various theories and possibilities to help as construct a more accurate picture of Magdalene. She does this in a scholarly way--but her writing avoids the jargon and unnecessarily long words of some other scholarly books on religion. In other words, you're not likely to fall asleep reading it. In fact, it's an eye-opener. Schaberg brings together and explains a number of different theories about Magdalene and about the events surrounding the Crucifixion. I personally didn't feel the quotes from Virginia Woolf were necessary, but I appreciate her attempt to make the material even more meaningful by using them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to unravel the Magdalene mystery.  
 No profound thoughts here!  I just loved it, including and maybe especially, the binky fly-a-way party!  I have the audio book and can't imagine a better reader than Blair Brown!  Oh, Anne Tyler!  Thank you! 
 My professor used  this book for a numerical methods course, and the computer programs within were helpful, but I wouldnt use this book for an undergrad course. There are no hand-worked examples in the book, which might make this book inappropriate for a first course in the subject 
 Well, it was 103 degrees last night in Baltimore, but I had the car windows open, air off, singing Dixieland-style "Santa Clause is Coming to Town" with Barry.  OK, I'm nuts, but whaddoicare!  There are only 11 songs here, but they are super, high-power big band arrangements.  I love Christmas songs anyway, so much peace and love.  Why only at Christmas?  These are lively arrangements of the old favorites, that make you think of the family around the tree.  But, oh my, "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm"  really rocks!  I LOVE that arrangement!  I blast that bad boy on the car radio at 60 mph and sing, LOUD!  Revs me up for work for hours.  There are also 2 absolutely beautiful songs I never heard before, "River" and "A Gift of Love," the latter written by Barry.  A beautiful collection of songs from 2002 and a treat for any Manilownian.  So hey, get outside the box and listen to it all year long.  By the way, it's great to hear somebody still say, and sing, the word "Christmas". 
 Published in 1886, THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE was an instant sensation and had a tremendous impact on later generations; it would not be an exaggeration to say that there have been hundreds of stage and film productions drawn either directly or indirectly from the original Robert Louis Stevenson story.  Readers who come to the story from these adaptations, however, will very likely be surprised: few of them do more than borrow Stevenson's central concept.  Unlike the numerous stage and film adaptations, Dr. Jekyll is not a young or remarkably handsome man, nor the book does not contain any of the romantic subplots to which its adaptations are prone.  At approximately one hundred pages, the story is very direct and extremely well suited to Stevenson's very precise style, which is very clean yet extremely evocative and very readable.  That said, modern readers are unlikely to be shocked by the book.  For one thing, the story is too well known; for another, it contains very little of the graphic horror typical of current horror stories.  But more than anything else, DR. JEKYLL is very distinctly a novel that draws from the Victorian era, and much of its impact was due to that society's remarkable hypocrisy; it was a world in which appearances were everything and a double life "acceptable" as long as you were not caught at it.  The same concept arises in two other novels from the same era, Bram Stoker's DRACULA and Oscar Wilde's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, albeit in distinctly different forms.  But whereas the Stoker and Wilde novels transcend their era, Stevenson's tale does not, and with the passing of Victorian attitudes the work has lost a great deal of its power to shock.  Even so, Stevenson does touch a nerve with his chemically-induced transformation; then as now, drug abuse was a scourge, and in addition to this the work is somewhat similar to Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN in the sense that it anticipates a host of ethical concerns that have become more and more pressing with the passage of time.  Although it has not held up as well as the other titles named, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE is nonetheless unavoidable for any one who has an interest in gothic or horror literature because it had--and continues to have--such a tremendous influence on later works.  Stevenson's prose is elegant, it is "an easy read," and I think most contemporary readers will enjoy it if they make the effort to see it within the context of its era.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 This book is a very nice introduction if you already have some notions of QFT. It can happily supplement Lowell Brown's book for instance. Its main characteristics is conciseness, it goes straight to the point, in the minimum expenditure of time and effort, without sacrifying mathematical correctness. Unfortunately some important topics are almost absent from the book, such as Ward identities, or infrared divergences. But the book remains self-contained despite this 
 I read "Ellen Foster" for the first time about eight years ago, but I wanted to tackle it again before reading Kaye Gibbons' sequel. This is an excellent story narrated by Ellen, an 11-year-old girl who has had a very difficult life. Her mother died and her alcoholic father was abusive and neglectful, which resulted in Ellen being shipped off to a variety of foster homes. Ultimately, spunky and determined Ellen decides to take matters into her own hands and seek out a safe haven for herself.  "Ellen Foster" is set in the American South and it tackles the issues of racial prejudice and self-awareness. Throughout the book, Ellen demonstrates the racial biases that have been instilled in her by her community when she refers to her "colored friend," Starletta. However, by the end of the story, Ellen has learned a lot about the things that really matter in life and she realizes that the only way to judge a person is to study their actions and their character, not the color of their skin.  One of the best things about this book is its tone...Gibbons does an excellent job of telling this story in the words of a young girl who grew up in the Southern states. The writing contains numerous colloquialisms, slang terminology, and humor, which make the novel even more enjoyable.  This is a great book and a pretty quick read...I hope "The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster" is equally impressive 
 Dead prez is a constant reminder of what hip-hop is now and what it could have been. Social injustice, racism, and other social issues are all over all of dead prez's stuff.

 Every teacher and student should read this book. Especially those who are interested in reading and writing. It is a great study on the views and teachings of those who reside in our destructive culture. Its a short quick read, that will make you question even more the teachings of our culture.  Warning: This book will make you want to drop out of school and persue what ever it is you want to persue. It will also make you want to be a writer.  Derrick Jensen is one of the mose important writers of our time, and this is just another one of his masterpieces... A++ 
 When these towels arrived at my home, I was surprised by how big and soft they were. Most kitchen towels I have had have been rather small and weren't very absorbent. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how nice these towels really are. 
 It is what I call one of the sick day movies or snow day movies, because it is a movie that requires you to be still and watch it.  I love the great costumes and actors, Landau as Rufio has always been a favorite.  Its one of those movies that while you cannot take as historical in every way, you can take for what it truly is and that is a love story that is so great that it has survived more than two thousand years.  I have seen every version of Cleopatra, I love that she was a woman who was in control of her destiny when most women were pawns in a man's game.  Elizabeth Taylor for so many reasons is an actress that I love.  Rex Harrison as Julius and even Richard's Marc Antony was great.    My favorite scene is the one that I referenced and if you are a true fan of this movie you will know which one I mean.  Oh, I also love the character Apollodorus, through the end when he admits his love for Cleopatra 
 I don't know how I would survive without this book.  I keep it right on my coffee table and consult it almost daily as new questions arise with my baby.  It is very thorough and it is easy to find what you are looking for.  Every new mother needs this book 
 If you have ever visited one of their excellent restaurants, Shunju in Tokyo, you know what I mean. Not only their simple, yet very creative Japanese food, this book introduces you the essence of what makes their food special. If you want to learn and appreciate the sprit of Japanese food beyound Sushi and Tempura, this is the book for you. The photographs are beautiful, and cooking methods are very easy to follow. I highly recommend this book for any food lover 
 My wife and I recently picked up this cookbook and were amazed at the number of excellent recipes.  Most cookbooks I have bought recently have a fraction of the number of recipes that are in "The Family Kitchen" by Debra Ponzek.  We especially love the easy directions and stories behind each recipe. Each recipe lists tasks the children can perform which is a great way to keep my kids (wife, grandparents) busy.  Buy this book for the excellent selection of recipes and especially the traditional chocolate cake recipe; IT IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT  !!!     
 I just finished reading Friedman's book and feel it is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the rapid changes effecting our world 
 I purchased this product for my 3 yr old.  He loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise.  It did not come with instructions, so we're having to self teach ourselves the features.  Surprisingly, I can't get the vibration feature to work with his Nascar game and this is a Nascar race wheel.  The vibration works for his SpongeBob game?? 
 This is our favorite flavor to use to make hamburger jerky.  Our grandson will not eat hamburgers but eats this and loves it.  Yes, he knows it's made of hamburger but he doesn't care. It's hard to find in the stores sometimes.  Walmart thinks it's a seasonal item, really that's what the clerks told us.  Be aware that Nesco has changed the look of the box recently so look for a different pic on it. It's great that Amazon is carrying this product. We LOVE this mix. Makes great jerky 
 Whenever I need a baking recipe at home, this is the book I usually get it from.  Here is where one will find shortbread, pancakes, biscuits, devils' food cake, apple pie, and muffins.  I use it more often than the rest of my baking books put together.  If there is only one baking book on your bookshelf, this is one to have.  The author understands what the average home baker is and is not capable of.  She also seems to understand that the best recipes are those that have the fewest ingredients. All things considered, it is the baking book I recommend the most often. I find it to be reliable and useful.  In recent years, there has been a plethora of snazzy dessert books.  They have beautiful, glossy pages, top notch food styling, a famous name, and a smiling face on the cover.  Problem is that the recipes are, at heart, ordinary recipes; they also feature sophisticated techniques and skillful decorations. Worse, they are often poorly edited, and many have not gone through a test kitchen. If you are a professional or advanced amateur pastry chef, they are a treasure trove; for the rest of us, they are useless.  The Fanny Farmer Baking Book is entirely different: you will find several hundred classic, easy to do recipes that will become regulars in your home kitchen for years.  I was impressed by both the quantity and quality of the recipes.    My main problem with this book is the poor organization.  Some of the chapters are 150 pages long, but the table of contents merely lists the chapter title, and there is no other detail.  The Pie chapter, for example, has the following sections: Types, Crusts and Toppings, Cooling and Storage, Freezing, Ingredients, Equipment, Dough, Rolling and Shaping, Storing, Basic Master Recipe, more than two dozen crusts and doughs, puff pastry, Toppings, and recipes for pies with: fresh fruit, preserved fruit,  deep dish, classics, sweet cheese, cream, chiffon, custard, breakfast, translucent custard, candy, mincemeat, turnovers, dumplings, not to mention a whole section devoted to tarts.  Yet, by looking at the scanty table of contents, you would never know this.  Likewise the cake chapter: it is thoughtfully organized by cake type, but you would never know this by looking at either the table of contents or chapter head. More than once I have found myself puzzling over the confusing index, and then having to flip through more than 100 pages of text to get the information or recipe I need.  Each chapter starts with a master recipe that explains all the tools and steps in excruciating detail that takes several pages; all the of the rest of the recipes in the chapter use that master recipe as the basic technique.  Of course, you will never find them unless you take the time and patience to physically leaf through the whole chapter.  The last part of the bread chapter features several detailed, reliable recipes for puff pastry and danish.    It has the following chapters: General Information, Pies and Tarts, Cookies, Cakes, Yeast Bread, Quick Bread, Crackers.    There are a few losers (Curry Refrigerator Cookies, Rosewater-Almond Pound Cake, Linzer Torte where the jam is like leather, a one bowl Lemon Pudding Cake that requires two bowls; chocolate cakes using cocoa powder that do not taste all that chocolaty). I object to the name of this otherwise wonderful book.  Fannie Farmer never wrote a baking book, and her name does not belong in the title.  The author is wrong about her Danish recipe being better than a commercial bakery, and also about storing Irish Soda Bread for 8 hours before eating. In general, however, I have remarkably few quibbles with the information presented.  
 Fabulous book and just what I was looking for.  Althought still a beginner, my instructor has been exposing us to the spiritual aspects of yoga.  I was looking for more information and have found it in Judith's book.  Written in a very straight forward and loving manner, she provides an excellent format for any person to begin to integrate their personal spiritual beliefs with their yoga practice and everyday life.  I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting more out of their practice than a no pain no gain attitude 
 I needed some circus music to promote a fundraiser our Lion's club was having (a circus).  I got the CD on time and it sounded great.  I could not find this type of music anywhere else. Thanks 
 This is an excellent book for all treasure hunters and people who like to read some good history. It tells of how a man from Arkansas cracks the secret treasure code of a secret Southern society. The Knight of the Gold Circle. At the end of the Civil War certain powerful men in the South were going to save up big for a second war. Their saving were in Gold and buried in depositorys across the South. This books in an interesting read. 
 After recently reading and reviewing Nancy Werlin's THE RULES OF SURVIVAL, I went in search of some of her other books. I discovered DOUBLE HELIX, and it didn't disappoint me.  Eli Samuels, salutatorian of his graduating class, has decided to postpone college for a year. His father is not pleased. But Eli is struggling to decide just exactly where he is headed in life. Complicating matters are his relationship with his girlfriend and his mother's illness, Huntington's disease.  Eli and his father have been struggling with Ava's illness for many years, but the end is near. She is confined to a nursing home and not even aware of their visits. Eli's future is uncertain because Huntington's disease is hereditary. His mother may have passed him the gene which carries the disease. A simple blood test holds the answer, but Eli is not ready to know the truth.  Dr. Quincy Wyatt, a famous scientific researcher, offers Eli a job at Wyatt Transgenics. It involves caring for research animals and helping in the lab. The more Eli learns about Dr. Wyatt and the work of his company, the more he begins to question what he knows about his own life.  Using clever twists and turns, Nancy Werlin has created a real nail-biter that makes this book hard to put down.  Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka "Readingjunky 
 I got this book, not knowing how useful the information would be to me. I never used herbs before, but now I know how to take care of myself without antibiotics or drugs. I actually lost 23 pounds by following the author's advice/guidelines! Who knew herbs were so useful and they work too! This book is a must have for men and women 
 I have recommended this book to several of my expecting friends, and each of them have equally loved it.  I needed the laughter during my lonely pregnancy, and this book provided 100%.    I was really surprised reading some of the negative reviews given in this forum.  Although, I know not everyone will have the same opinion, I was taken back by one review.  I left the following comment with respect to it:  "Being a "Playmate" is strictly a label Kelliann Festa has chosen to use against the author. I find it quite offensive to even bring it into context, because the author was already candid about it as well as her LAW background. So, she has looks and brains, too! Face it, the author has a humorous point of view on pregnancy that many people appreciate...regardless of her past! Geesh!"   
 This is now one of my favourite books! It was great. I liked how suspenseful it was, even if the story got a bit slow between the important parts. Bram Stoker does a great job at descriptions with lots of nice details. It was pretty creepy. It didn't think it would be, but it was.  Something else I liked was how the women in the book weren't all...flimsy. It's a nice change how Mina actually plays a big part in the story and she's a strong character. Great book! Love it! I definately reccomend it 
 This is some of the most fun I've had watching a movie.  I took it as a blind recommendation and it has become one of my favorite comedies in years.    Using Shakespeare's Macbeth as his source, former actor Billy Morrissette makes (I believe) his feature film debut as an actor with this brilliantly dark (I know, I'm oxymoronic) comedy.    Set in the depressed town of Scotland, Pennsylvania circa 1973, Morrissette turns Shakespeare's original story about a power hungry wife pushing her too contemplative husband into a bloody post-regicide reign into a tale of an over ambitious wife pushing her dullard husband into murder to take over a fast food joint.  Morrissette had obvious fun playing with the characters names and using them to even propel the story.  There is of course our anti-hero/heroine Joe "Mac" and his wife Pat - the McBeth's, both of whom work for Duncan, the owner of (what else) a donut shop.  Through shrewd manipulation Pat pushes.  There's also Lt. McDuff (Christopher Walken seemingly having more fun than he has in anything I can recall him in); Banquo - becomes Banco, and Shakespeare's witches/weird sisters become an unholy trio of drugged out hippies (deliciously played by Andy Dick, Amy Smart and Tim Levitch.    Acting honors go all the way around but James LeGros and Maura Tierney get special mention as the unholy couple.  LeGros captures the perfect 70's dullard, small time dreams, clueless and nearly almost ruining everything.  He's a delight to watch.  Ms. Tierney - an actress who singlehandedly kept me from ever watching E.R. nearly shocked the life out of me by actually proving to be an amazing actress.  If for no other reason (but thank God there are plenty of 'em) the movie would be worth watching for Tierney's most delicious, crazed performance of the film.  Her transparent subtlety is almost menacing and her greedy ambition is mouthwateringly contagious - you want her to get away with everything.    I can't recommend this movie enough!  Hilarious and disturbing Scotland, Pa. is a joy! 
    The tract 3(Roasting on an open fire), tract 10(The White Christmas-by Michael Boton) and 15 (Sleigh ride- by Debby Gibson) were my favorites. It was pretty ggod, actually

 I've have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and good sized hand towels. So many times the bath towels are huge and the hand towels too small. These are good sized and hang on the rod beautifully.  The colors of the towels are also beautiful. I'm buying more for our guest bathroom.  Thank goodness I searched on Amazon. I don't believe these wonderful Martex New Splendor items are sold anywhere else 
 The basic controversy about this book is that it shows cartoonish characters in sexual positions--funny ones on innertubes, swings, etc. Some parents think that it's wrong for kids to know how sex happens. Some think that the pictures offer a great opportunity--perhaps for the parent to have a discussion about healthy, responsible sex.  This book is for the mom who is looking for a way to tell her kids how the sperm gets into the mommy. Yes, I'm one of those parents because I believe that only with the right information will my kids have the wisdom to make good decisions. After all, when they need to make this decision, I probably won't be there, will I?  This is for the parent that believes that having the discussion about sex early and often will encourage the child to continue to come to the parent for sound advice.  This book was a delightful way to make a potentially uncomfortable discussion comfortable. Although the pictures don't get into many details, they allow parents to broaden the discussion. Parents can use the pictures to talk about how it's possible to keep the sperm from getting to the egg; why we might want to do that; when it's a good time to have sex and when it isn't such a great idea; that with this knowledge we have control over what happens.  I love the fact that this book shows that sex is fun. Sex IS fun. That's an important, healthy message too. In the end, I'd rather that my kids hear this from me. They hear it from movies, their friends, and television as it is, so I like the fact that this book allows me to offer my tempering opinion on the subject.  This is a great book for moms who want to raise kids who grow up feeling that sex is a natural, good part of life. The mom who buys this book wants to say that sex is not dirty; sex is not shameful. This book is for the mom who wants her kids to have the basic knowledge they need to act responsibly 
 I'll take The Emerald Tablets of Thoth The Atlantean by Doreal. This book is seriously power packed.  If you've ever been out there.

 I liked the text to sit back and get a better idea what I had bought at my own speed. I started out with a Nikon 35mm for my work. The change to Digital Photography D70 was a trip made easier by this book

 The production quality of the disks is excellent; you can hear people breathe out on certain sounds.  There are at least half a dozen different speakers, each with their own enunciation quirks and conversational speed.    Although very little English is provided and these disks are not intended to stand alone, I was able to guess 90% of the content of the first disk based on my memory of high school French and my contact with Spanish speakers over the years.  The very short dialogues present enough context that it is easy to guess what is going on, and the lessons build slowly in complexity.   Phrases useful for survival are emphasized--gambits for the hotel reservation desk, the restaurant, the telephone.  This course is exactly what it is billed to be: colloquial.  While it is clear that I could never master grammar without written material, the time spent listening to this disk has been worthwhile (I have only tried the first of the two in the set).  At times when I am desperate to see a word written out, I have been able to find it using the internet, on sites such as http://www.travlang.com.  For a tourist who only has time to study while commuting, I think this is a great study program 
 A well-researched look at aviation that reminded me of the novels of Nevil Shute. My favorite chapter was Friday Norton QA 11:50am. A perfect description of the working methods of a certain veteran TV newsman who just retired at age 88. Of course there are plot holes. The heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards. But as the jeopardy increases, the guards aren't there. No followup mention. What happened to them? Some vulgarity in language. But all in all, a great fun read. 
 If you are breaking down the walls of a dogma-ridden religious indoctrination and want a guide and traveling companion as you explore the terrain outside the boundaries, you may find Concepts a useful tool for your journey. Carleton's friendly, personal writing style, and his use of anecdotes from his own life to illustrate points he is crafting, makes reading fairly easy for such a heady and comprehensive topic. Although I didn't always agree with the author's assumptions or conclusions, I found many of his arguments thought provoking. He obviously loves his subject and has given it a great deal of thought. If your touchstone is science, and you like reading that is weighted toward the intellectual, you may find many useful jewels in this wide-ranging exploration 
 if not the best computer-related book I've read. The author's unassuming and eloquent discourse makes reading the book a very interesting proposition. The manner in which the topics are covered are absolutely great and very intuitive. The books is absolutely well structured and well supported. It was surely a surprise to find a computer-programming book where the author was candid and unambiguous. As a programmer coming from Java I found this book to be quite helpful and straight forward. The chapter on pointers and references does a superb job at getting the reader to understand the concept and to be able to apply it. The appendices are also great with lots of handy information. This is one of the few computer books that I actually dare to recommend buying without any qualms 
 I have been type 1 for 20 years and on a pump for 36 days now!  This book was very informative. I could relate to much of the material since I have been diabetic for so long. Since going on a pump, I could relate easily to her pump related advice. A excellant read for anyone new to a pump or considering it. Just because I have been diabetic for 20 years insures me of nothing. Pump therapy is very different compared to anything else. Informative books such as this one are essential to improving and educating each one of us. I strongly recommend this book 
 William Byrnes' book is obviously one of only a few books touching all aspects of arts management today. Readers will learn how arts organizations and arts management evolved, the theories and processes behind strategic planning and decision-making, and how to integrate various management theories with practical applications to this type of organization. Of course, not all of Byrnes' examples lets copy into other cultural markets, but there are a lot of general basics for arts managers and administrators worldwide. We can really advise to buy this publication 
 Grant And Sherman: The Friendship That Won The Civil War will prove an eye-opener to many, describing the relationship of two of the most important figures of the Civil War - who happened to also be friends. Grant and Sherman shared many common experiences despite their differences: they were prewar failures, they each struggled to join the war effort, and they each collaborated even while under fire on the battlefield, giving orders and learning from their decisions - and each other. Until now little has been written about this friendship, and about their common ties: Charles Bracelen Flood has written about the war before but here excels in presenting the depth of an unusual friendship which not only influenced but eventually won the Civil War. A 'must' for any who would understand Civil War connections. 
 All I can say is FANTASTIC!!!  A must for everyone's book collection 
 Great book about a great show. The pictures of the cast both from the show and behind the scenes are worth the price of the book alone 
          The negative reviews of this book, even if they cavil over other aspects, seem to be primarily hostile to the concept of using drugs to treat animal behavior problems (especially dogs since neurotic ones can present the most trouble for their human companions). This has long been a dead issue in human illness and only those far outside the mainstream would consider behavioral treatment alone for human anxiety disorders, depression or certain neuroses such as obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias. Anxiolytics, tricyclics and SSRI's have long proven their value in treatment and have brought better lives to millions.     It is more difficult to determine if pharmacologic treatments are effective if the patient cannot communicate verbally but, given the fact that neurotransmitters are the same in human and dog brains, there is reason to believe that they may be. It is important that this area be explored using the scientific method to the extent possible and the results released in popular form in order to inform the public as to success or failure of these drugs, so valuable in other contexts. This book makes some effort in that direction and it is hopefully only a first step. It is time that those of us who value animal companions were given something more than quasi-mystical preaching from the animal training industry when the issue is serious behavioral problems. Most of us would not deny ourselves the best treatment available and we should help the animals that we love in the same way if drugs are shown effective. 
 WOW! When I found this book on amazon I thought 'must buy' and so I bought it. Simply because it looked hot, and because I adored By Arrangement. When I read LoaTN, I discovered that the book was even hotter than I'd dared hope for. Ian was, to be blunt, all man. And I'm talking MAN! He was sexy, proud, sexy, strong, sexy, tender, sexy, filled with a gorgeous and admirable love for Reyna and, yep, sexy. He possessed all qualities a great hero should have, and then some. And he played his part from the second Reyna looked at him. Reyna was also incredible. I hate it when the heroine is too stupid to take a breath and walk at the same time. Thank God, and Madeline Hunter, that Reyna was not like Barbie, even if she was blond, thin and very much like the first breath of dawn. Reyna was smart and she had guts! I absolutely loved reading about how she teased Ian, and then froze (or melted ;) )when he tried to seduce her. Yet she tried to stick to what she wanted, and while reading the book I almost cheered 'Go Reyna, go Reyna!'But, don't get me wrong. I cheered 'Go Ian' more than a few times. I loved every scene with him in it, but SPOILER when he rescues her from Reginald, I just felt this surge of devotion and sweet love for him. Ian and Reyna were made for each other. That's something we all knew from the start. I mean: it was never likely that Reginald or perhaps Elizabeth would ever interfere with the action.  I loved reading how they got to really know each other (and not just physically :P )and how they both changed for the other. There are so much I liked about this book. Reading about Christiana, David, Morvan and Anna again was GREAT, and all the characters were so convincing. And also, Madeline Hunter has done some great historical research. From warfare down to the thinnest shift. I think, or, all right, I know, that what I liked a lot was Ian's personality. I enjoyed that he was a bit arrogant and full of himself. That's what made him pursue Reyna with such vigor. He was so certain of his own sexuality (I mean, just look at the title), that he had no trouble helping Reyna with hers. Okey,I'll stop talking about Ian now. I just want you, yes YOU, to buy this book. It's only a couple of dollars and that's like nothing when you think of the experience that awaits you when you read it. I just know that I loved, oh LOVED, this book and I find myself opening it at a random page to read about l'amour when I want to read something good. You know, this book actually kept me up for one night, which isn't so cool when you're a student, but- Why are you still reading? Buy it! 
 I found this read to be just great.It gives you a brief history of the begining of the company and brings you right through the culture of the biker and the attraction of the Harley Davidson.A true motorcyclist will be totally engrossed. 
 This book will guide you to learn basic concept relating to advertising on the internet. And it was very useful for me to understand the internet ad 
 just a wonderful book.  i had a thing for suzuki-roshi before reading this book, so there is my bias.  just a wonderful expresseion of soto zen in america 
 Bernard-henri Levy is a French hero and intellectual.  How many phiolospher can there possible be who would write a book called war, evil and the end the history?  Unfortunately I do not read French and therefore cannot judge the quality of the translation of this book from the original text but I have heard Mr Levy spoke on TV in English with an excellent command of the language.  I suppose he approved of this translation of his original text.  If you are not intimately famililar with recent French,German,Amercian philosopher/writer/phychologist (I am not) you will lack the proper foundation to enjoy this book.  Randomly selected from this book, he quoted Michel Focault, Nitzche, Jung, Kant, Proust and Fukuyama with great frequentcy and ease and most times without much introduction and explaination.  For example , to expalin the End oF History as part of the title of the book, he stated: "Secondly, Benjamin. The Benjamin. Once again, of the These on the Philosphy of History.  And the portrait, in "Thesis IX," of the one he calls "the chronicler" whose characteristic is that he "narrates events without distiction between the great the the small" (nothing, from the viwpoint of the chronicler, "nothing of all that has ever happpened" can or should be considered "of no use to History")...A philsophical logic: an effect no less mechanical, of the deconstrcution, following Franz Rosenzweig, of the concept of universal Histroy and the great signifying scenes summoned up-to say that History as such, does not exit, is to admit that there is no longer, anywhere, an authority or a judement upon which one can determine the meaning that should be accorded events"  (Page 287) (What does "accorded" events mean? Does the author mean recorded events?)   Some very provocative ideas and persuasive also, but who the heck is Benjamin and Franz Rosenzweig?  Either the author nor the translator provided any backgroud or introduction to these writers and their thoughts.  This book are full of examples of such event: beautiful ideas supported by famous and not so-famous writers of Philophopy and literature but with the writing style sometimes can make comprehension a little tought.  (Translation problems or his style?  Lots of sentences are not even sentences at all.)   Despite my minor complaints regarding his style, this book gave me a better understanding how to percieve the world in this "WAR ON TERROR" kind of enviornment.  He stated that war is just like birth, sex, sin and taxes--all unavoidable facts of life-war will be always with us and always be with us despite technological progress and the unfortunately invention of nuclear weapons.  Mr Levy has personaly met some of these people who were waging wars around the world:Afganstain, Bosnia, Sudan, Iraq, and just from these interviews that he mangaged to get were well worth reading the book. 
 Edgar Leoni does a fine job with this book.  Rather than engaging in superfluous speculation and spiritualization, Leoni simply translates the quatrains directly from French/Latin into English, and then compares the predicted events with possible matches to history.  For predictions which haven't yet occurred, he gives an intelligent, straight-forward conclusion on its meaning, and does not hesitate to admit that some of the quatrains are simply to vague and obscure to pin down.  This is also one of the few Nostradamus books to include all of the quatrains, as well as the preface and Epistle to King Henry II, in the correct chronological order.  The index is very complete and easy to use.  The only drawback is that Leoni wrote this book in 1960- if only he know what the rest of the 20th century would bring 
 Just see this movie, and see the work of a master movie director! Makes holliwood look bad. Remember; Baran means rain, you need to know this to understand the ending 
 Truely speaking, this is a very hilarious episode. Must see for every one 
 This particular disc has a wide variety of influenences.  One can detect middle eastern influences, what sounds like some Morrocan influences, and there is one song that could be mistaken for Bulgarian Chant.  And through each song, the gorgeous blend of voice and minimalist instrumentation makes for an unmuddled and gorgeously clear package 
 This really is Rice at her best.  I really liked the tale of the body thief; it starts with lestat trying to kill himself by exposing to the sun. Fourtunately for us he didn't succeed.  This book follows the relationship between lestat and david talbot and the struggle with this body thief. Really good ending 
 Together with Heavy D, there was this legendary duo that put Mount Vernon on the map, Pete Rock & CL Smooth debuted in the summer of '91 with their EP named All Souled Out, at this time Rock where known as Marley Marl's pal on the radio show In Control on WBLS. This was about to change drastically, and in record time this man became New Yorks most wanted producer. No one had bigger influence on the eastcoastsound in the early 90's as Pete Rock, and together with CL Smooth, he went in front as we like to call the gold age of hip-hop. Mecca and the Soul Brother is an essential record.   What you first recognize about Pete Rock's sound, is of course the horns. Plenty of his beats either have trumpet or saxophone (Check out "Act Like You Know", "Wig Out" and "If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right") This album is filled with soul- and jazzsamples and he even borrowed drums from James Brown. Compared with others heroes from that time period, like DJ Premier and Large Professor, I think that Rock's sound where warmer and more soulful, maybe that's why they called him "The Soul Brother".  As a rapper CL Smooth were the perfect partner for him, with an exceptional comfortable voice and flow, he was technically tight, with storytelling as his strong side. He called himself for "The Mecca", and punchlines and humor wasn't really his thing. Rock actually tried rappin' on the song "Soul Brother #1" ( Grand Puba wrote his lyrics) Their classic song, with a big C, "They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)" is also to be found here. An outstanding song, and for those who don't know, this song where dedicated to Trouble T-Roy, one of Heavy D's dancers, who died in a tragic accident in 1990. Other highlights are "Straighten It Out", "On and On" and "Can't Front On Me". Most of the in total 16 tracks, where a pleasure for my ear and this album is a time journey back to 1992. This record is timeless. Why? "No gimmicks", as Lord Finesse says. This is music with soul, period. Don't sleep on Money Earnin' Mount Vernons coolest duo. 
 I had been searching for a good paper airplane book for a long time looking for plans that involved only paper and folding - no scissors, tape, glue, paper clips, or anything extra.  While travelling for work in Arizona several years ago I found this book at a Barnes & Noble - it's the best paper airplane book I have ever run across.  Some of the folds can be challenging but the author's use of flip-through animation in the corners of the book help tremendously.  I've built and flown every plane in the book and they all perform incredibly - especially "The Plane".  Buy this book and you'll be amazed by the looks and performance of your paper airplanes 
 This movie asks the question: "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?" David (Jerry O'Connell) finds himself under increasing pressure to take the final plunge with his long time girlfriend (Bridgitte Wilson) after his best buddy Tyler becomes engaged. This news wreacks havoc on David's life as he tries to find the answer to the question the movie asks.  This movie is funny, very funny at times and also at times quite stupid, but it is good quality entertainment nonetheless. Ryan Reynolds steals the show unsurprisingly, as Mike, a freind to David and Tyler who is trying to figure out his own problems where he fits in in the world. A scene where he wakes up in a strangers bed after a hugely intoxicating night is absolutely hillarious... I bought this movie because I am a fan of the young cast, especially Reynolds and also because it is directed by Walt Becker, the same guy who gave us Van Wilder. Fans of that movie will love this, as will all fans of Reynolds and Jerry O'Connell. Anyone else may find it to be 'not their kinda movie' 
 In today's world where we think we know so much, one truth is overlooked. Our basic design as humans is we all feel the need to be loved. As children, we show we are open searchers of how things work. Maria Simma is a simple woman in her life, living in an isolated site on an Austrian hillside, earning her meager income plucking feathers from birds as pillow stuffing. Yet, she prays alot, much as her mother showed her. In a world, where we are so unaware of the Spiritual seed planted in all of us, Maria prays alot. And, because of this and her simple wordly nature, Souls visit her to seek help. They all want to finally enter Heaven, but they need some special few deeds done in their favor. How this unfolds and is related in this heart-changing book are tales that change our outlook to life 
   I knew I had to have this book the moment I saw it online.  I have always been very healthconscious and want the same for my kids. With the epidemic of obesity and juvenile diabetes it is to give my child the very best chance to live a healthy life.This book does not disappoint in any way.He gives his own personal experiences in a commensense practical way that anyone can understand. Everything he states is well documented with footnotes to other studies,this makes his points less controversial. I strongly recommend this book to any parent.    
 Back in these days, books were published mainly for literary merit. They were published because they were good. And this is one of those books - a story that definitely stood the test of time and is deemed as a classic today. It mainly concerns a young man named Hazel Motes, a man questing for his own church - the church of christ without christ - and who blinds himself. I read it a few times and each time enjoyed it more and more, though I have yet to check out the movie. It is one of those books that stays with you for a really long time. I recommend it to anybody who wants to curl up for a few hours with a good, well-written story. 
  Winning by Losing" will motivate you to change your lifestyle and lose weight. In one section the author explains the science behind nutrition and proper diet. In another section Jillian Michaels educates the reader about exercising and working out. She explains her unique fitness philosophy with simple descriptions and straightforward illustrations of exercises and how to do them. However, maybe the most important and most motivating part of the book is the section called "Self" where Jilliana addresses the psychological aspects of weight loss. As one of other reviewers rightly pointed out, "she shows the ordinary person how to become extraordinary". It is a great book with a thorough, detailed plan for proper diet plan and exercising. 
 Michael Felger provides a mini-history of the New England Patriots through a series of chapters, ordered mostly chronologically, that details many of the woes, and a few of the highlights, of this historically inept team.  Being a Patriots fan, this was a very nostalgic book.  Unfortunately, many of the memories are bad ones.  While this is not an in-depth detailed team history, Felger hits all the key events.  The book is organized into a series of very readable chapters that cover many of the laughable and the few laudable stories in the team's history.  There is a very consistent theme that runs throughout the book.  The New England Patriots have historically been a comically bad team, primarily because of four interrelated aspects - cash strapped or inept ownership, poor organizational structure, poor coaching, and poor quarterbacks.  The recent success of the team, on the other hand, is a result of the opposite - excellent ownership, excellent organizational structure, excellent coaching, and a good quarterback.    The first couple of chapters in the book cover the team's founding and early history as the Sullivans struggled to field competitive teams.  It's a wonder the team didn't fold within the first few years of its existence.  William Sullivan bought the Patriots franchise in 1959, joining the new American Football League, which competed, unevenly, with the well-established National Football League.  From its inception the organization was very cash strapped, which at times lead to tragi-comic episodes of penny pinching.  One story related in the book is how the team was told not to get under the covers at a hotel where they were resting before a game because it would cost extra money.  Moreover, they played in poor stadiums and eventually their home stadium was one of the more miserly in the league.  Sullivan isn't viewed as necessarily a terrible owner, he just never had the cash to compete evenly with other teams.  In fact, under the Sullivans, the team eventually became one of the better teams in the NFL.  Unfortunately, Sullivan's son Pat, through a terrible investment, ran the family's business into the ground, forcing the family to sell the Patriots.  The team went through some very lousy owners until it was eventually bought by current owner Robert Kraft, who has resurrected the franchise into a model sports organization.  The book moves quickly to what may have been the best Patriots team ever - even better than the Super Bowl winning teams - the 1976 New England Patriots.  This team certainly featured some of the best individual players in team history, including Hall of Fame guard John Hannah, Sam "Bam" Cunningham at tailback, Leon Gray (T), Russ Francis (TE), Hall of Fame cornerback Michael Haynes, Steve Nelson (LB), Ray "Sugar Bear" Hamilton (DE), and of course QB Steve Grogan.  This is the team that should have won the Super Bowl but for an egregiously bad roughing the passer penalty on Ray Hamilton in their first round playoff game against the Oakland Raiders during the 1977 playoffs.  This game and that penalty will live in infamy for New England fans.  We got our payback in 2001.  There are also a lot of players profiled in the book.  Entire chapters are devoted to Darryl Stingley, who was tragically paralyzed in a pre-season game on a hit by Jack Tatum in 1978, and John Hannah, considered by some to be the best offensive lineman in NFL history.  Of course throughout the book we meet numerous players from Gino Cappelletti in the 1960's to Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots long-time quarterback now with the Buffalo Bills.  A chapter toward the end of the book is devoted to the primary quarterbacks through New England's history: Jim Plunkett, Steve Grogan, Tony Eason, and Drew Bledsoe.  Later chapters discuss the revitalized New England Patriots of the 1980's.  This is a team that underachieved when it had good talent and overachieved when it reached Super Bowl XX as a Wild Card team after the 1985 season.  Unfortunately, they went on to be crushed by the Chicago Bears in that Super Bowl in a painful game to watch for Patriots fans.  The team eventually imploded - accusations of drug use tore apart the locker room and coach Raymond Berry soon departed, the Sullivan's eventually sold the team and it went through a period of horrible owners, coaches, and mismanagement.  On top of that, there were several incidents of poor behavior by the players, topped off by the sexual harassment of Lisa Olson, a Boston Herald sports reporter, in 1990.  This is a period of time when I was embarrassed to be a New England Patriots fan.   And finally there is a chapter on the Kraft Era - which shows how Kraft bought the team and struggled a bit to learn how to be an owner.  The first few years of ownership were a learning period that eventually led to the hiring of Bill Belichick and the establishment of a solid organization that gives the coaches and players the best chance to win.  It took some time for Kraft to find his legs, but he did it.  And the reward: a two-time Super Bowl champion team as of this writing and a successful structure that should allow the Patriots to be a top-tier competitive team for years to come.  There are two drawbacks to this book.  First, it basically stops after the 1996 season and treats the Super Bowl winning teams in a postscript.  Felger could have taken more time to round out the story through at least the first Super Bowl winning team in 2002 (the 2001 season).  Secondly, there really isn't anything completely new here.  Most Patriots fans will be already aware of nearly all the stories and events described in this book.  Nevertheless, there are personal touches with commentary and perspectives from players throughout the team's history and it's well organized and written.  Overall I would highly recommend this book for Patriots fans.  Very avid football fans would probably find it interesting.  It's a fast read.  Casual football fans I doubt would find anything compelling here.  Disclaimer: I am a diehard New England Patriots fan. 
 This is an excellent book.  Mary Wollstonecraft proves herself to be an extremely wise, intelligent and insightful woman.  Although the position of woman in the society do not correspond exactly to the one described by  Wollstonecraft, there are definitely twentieth century contemporaries to  the methods used to subjugate woman 200 years ago 
 I use this stuff all the time. It's by far the best double-sided tape on the market. It's extremely thin AND extremely sticky. I use it to put fabric on the back of unfinished furniture when I don't want holes from tacks. I've also used it to make bamboo and fabric flags. Forget traditional office double-sided tape. Flash Tape is the way to go for ALL crafts 
 This is in my humble opinion THE best of the 3+3 union (I know how can I say that about any Isley Brothers joint) That sound that they smoothly rode through the 70'S on is fully matured right here. It's just loaded with beautiful hits check out LOVERS EVE and BROWN-EYED GIRL then you'll see what I mean. The WHOLE joint is just TIGHT absolutly NO weak songs here. I don't know maybe it holds a sentimental value because of where I was in my life at that time but BUY IT and see for yourself how high it ranks on Isley Brothers scale 
 I love this shoes but my daughter like them better, the shoes arrived timely but when I tried them on they were too small. My daughter kept them and they look gorgeous 
 I'm a business student and this book saved my team and my grade in marketing class.  We were given the assignment of managing an ad campaign for a fictional company, and we were sorely lacking for strategy until I found this book.  Filled with case studies from the real world and the collective wisdom of the Kellogg faculty, this book was the key to putting together our promotional plan which ended up getting the highest grade in the class and a school award 
 I read this whole book from start to finish on a series of flights that I took recently and I was totally taken with the story and the science behind it. I couldn't put it down and I haven't read a book in 10yrs! From a phenomenal underlying technological journey merges the principles of many scientific disciplines ranging from zoology, biology, acoustics, geophysics, chemistry, mechanics, electronics, mathematics, not to mention anthropology.    As a physicist, I loved the explanation of acoustic coupling and aliasing, a very impressive bridge, making connections between fundamental processes that are essential in tying together a very complex phenomenon.  There were tragic elements to the story that were horrific and left me in tears, but at the same time, a remarkable account of caring and human bonding. Congratulations to the author.  I can't wait for her next book!  
 A deeply moving story of love and family with real and flawed characters that made me want to cry and call my loved ones to say "I love you". This is a fantastically written novel with powerfully crafted characters that play an extraordinary role in this coming of age family story where the power of genetics can explain many things, yet not all, for we are more than DNA, or at least the latter is what I so strongly want to believe. A remarkable novel with real life people and tragic events that will make you want to weep. Superb. I absolutely recommend it. 
 I bought this book for my daughter and have noticed a change in her behavior.  She now does things that we ask her to do and tries to be nice to us instead of hostile.  Then when she requests a privilege and we waver, she says "But I babysat my brother and I folded the towels and I made a cake like you asked me too."  Of course who can argue with that logic?  I haven't read the book but I assume it is along the lines of "show your parents how mature you are and they will give you more freedom" 
 To almost anyone, Tiffany and Co. and Palm Beach would go hand and hand, analagous like Lalique and Monte Carlo.  The concept for this book is very interesting and the author fully realizes how to exploit the two to their most advantagious.  The text is highly informative and the images are crisp and beautifully presented.  I agree with one of the reviews that this is an expensive coffee table book, but frankly im sure those interested in this sort of thing, will not think twice about the price of admission.  Really a wonderful book on a very interesting subject, well done indeed 
 At last a real scholarly book about the Godess Hekate.  Mrs. Johnston has researched her subject in depth and has produced one of the best books on this special godess, and i have read almost everything that has been published about Hekate.  I recommend this book, along with the others Mrs. Johnston has writen or edited. She is a true scholar 
 No wonder this guy can write so well. He's probably seen it all.  This is a must have collection for all stephen king fans. Even if you wanted to own only on book by stephen king; this would be it. It's the perfect compilation of short stories.  Apt pupil - Powerfully driven to the point of parnoid danger. The Body - Gripping story of four friends who find out more about themselves on the road to life. Rita Hayworth and the shawshank redemption - It is undescribable to be able to put down in words just how good this one story is. The rare gem that we've all been searching for. It's almost like finding a peice of history and sharing it with the world. The narrative character, Red, is so rich with his words that he is one of the greatest narrators of all time. You''l just melt with compassion for andy defrense. He's the regular joe that is the main point of the story. You'll probably read this one over and over again. I know it's one of my favorites. The Breathing method - although shrouded in vague descriptions; it does have it's perks. It's another weird tale to tell your friends gatthered around the fire place on halloween night.  Enjoy 
 I started on the Dresden Files series late, but I'm making up time quite fast. I love his books and his style of writing. His sense of humor and Dresden's witty and stupid remarks are always a plus. Anyone who wishes to read something new and creative should pick up one of Jim Butcher's books 
 I am highschool student. all my life I have been made fun of by fellow student once I got into middle school it got worse people started asking me What Are You? and started trying to force me to pick a race no matter what I always replied I am mixed this book shows the courage and struggle us biracial and biculturel go througth everyday a truly wonderful book 
 I am 33 mom of 3 and at my wits end with Acne.  I had been to a dermatologist again (off and on throughout the years) and been put on topical medications which were not working.  I stumbled upon this and CANNOT BELIEVE that after 3 days my acne started clearing up.  It has now been 6 days and it is only getting better.  I went on the 3 day diet and am now incorporating his ideas into my regular lifestyle.  I think I have lost 3 pounds too, but to me the clear skin is the best!!  I have been taking a multivitamin, some extra Vitamin A and selenium drinking a lot of green tea, use flax seed on my yogurt and just started taking fish oil too and that has worked for me.  If you have acne and really want a solution, I say give it a try...just incorporate what you can into your life and see.  p.s. I love!! coffee but am going without except for maybe 1 cup a day 
 I first saw the Los Angeles River in TV shows and movies like Terminator 2 and have ever since been interested in learning more about this strange, concrete encased urban waterway.  Blake Gumprecht's book does a great job of providing the history of the Los Angeles River from its pristine condition two centuries ago into the modern era as a "Freeway for Water" in the book "The Los Angeles River."  The author balances his coverage of the river and fairly represents both sides of the struggle to restore it back to a more natural appearance versus the need to provide flood control protection with concrete fortifications.  The book is extremely well researched and documented.  Extensive maps and photos shed light on the topic and make the historical changes easier to follow.  My only wish is that a future edition will include color photos 
 I ordered this cheap little book thinking it would be like a basic introduction to color and having different colors to enhance or affect different frames of mind.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  There is a mountain of information in this little thing!  Not only does it cover basic color concepts, it goes into Chakra, Reiki, Pendulum, and more.  What a wonderful source book!  I will be reading this again, and using it for reference 
 From a perspective previous to some of our current stereoptypical thinking about native Americans. Rich in historical detail and (to me) surprising details about the Cherokee. I particularly enjoyed the Cherokee mythology. My thinking about native Americans is changed.  
 I used this flat iron and was amazed.  My hair is very thick and it usually takes me one hour to flat iron my whole head.  Well, I used this flat iron and was done in 1/2 hour.  I love this flat iron so much, I bought my friend one too 
 "Let Go" is Avril Lavigne's debut album.  (She was only about 18 years old at the time).  I would have to classify this as a rock album as opposed to punk rock (though there are touches of pop and metal).  Avril Lavigne's style is very casual and catchy, and most of these tracks are good, straight-forward, easy-to-sing-along-with songs.  The album features what is by far Avril Lavigne's most famous song, "Complicated," as well as the other singles "Sk8er Boi," "I'm With You," and "Losing Grip."  As a whole, it is a very listenable album with a nice variety of musical flavor.  I think that anyone who likes casual rock or pop rock music, especially young ladies, will probably like it 
 This is a wonderful, well-worn book in my personal library that I read many times growing up. Not only is this book full of moral truths, but it is also a fun glimpse into the magical world of life in the Swiss Alps.  I just recently re-read it as an adult and still love it 
 Shot in 1960s Paris, Omar Sharif, now in his seventies, plays an elderly Muslim shopkeeper who befriends the teenage Jewish boy Momo who has been bereft of any meaningful relationship with his father 
 With her large, expressive eyes and rather plain features, Dorothy Mc Guire is perfect for the mute servant girl in this superb gothic thriller. So is stylish noir director Robert Siodmak who really knows how to translate troubled inner worlds into complex camera effects. Together, they transform the hoary elements of a maniacal killer, a spooky old mansion, and a houseful of suspects, into a memorable movie experience.   I paricularly like the opening sequence where a 1900's audience sits watching an early feature length film, The Kiss. The rest of the audience sits stoically, not knowing what to make of the new-fangled experience. However, Mc Guire's simple servant girl sits enraptured, absolutely transfixed, her luminous eyes suffering along with the endangered heroine, whose predicament curiously foreshadows Mc Guire's own plight yet to come. I doubt that any actress has won over an audience any faster than during those few seconds.  Credit should also go to that terrific RKO tandem of art director Albert D'Agostino and set director Darrel Silvera, whose artistic eye helped lift that studio into the pantheon of 1940's black & white. Together, they manage to keep a single set, the old house, from becoming boring to look at, while perfectly complementing Siodmak's own gothic sensibilities.  Still, there is a downside. Poor Kent Smith plays the young doctor. Technically, he's a competent enough actor; however, his charisma factor registers somewhere between  dull gray and dried cement. Here his rather smarmy physician appears to have wandered over from the set of Young Doctor Kildare. Fortunately, his screen time is limited.   In compensation are the wonderfully daffy Elsa Lanchester as the cook, and Carleton the dog as Carleton the dog, perhaps the most beautifully ugly face in the history of canine thespians. Also, making an impressive appearance is an apparent forerunner of hurricane Katrina , howling and thundering for the entire ninety minutes in true gothic fashion.  Anyhow, this is a genuinely artistic suspenser from RKO's golden period, proving once again why Hollywood's eventual stampede to technicolor was not an unmixed blessing.   
 Craig Womak's "Red on Red" is a briliant analysis of the current state of Native Literature.  He gives the reader insights and guidance for understanding native writers, and a scholar can learn the much needed  literary foundations for learning to "read" native writers.   THEN, just to prove that even criticism is fun, he changes up in mid-stream  and offers extremely hilarious narratives, written from his own Creek  roots.  Very fun to read, and an engaging writer 
 Just went through a one week power outage in Buffalo and here's what helped:  1. Crank LED Flashlights are great. I had one from Gander Mountain with 3 leds and you could select   either one or three leds to light. I also used two Lightwave led flashlights, the 7 led model and the 3   led model. Both are great and lasted all week. My favorite was the Freeplay Indigo led lamp. Worked great   and I carried it everywhere. Candles are ok but you can't walk with them, they're dangerous, and they   melt faster than you think.  2. Get a led headlamp for hands-free, up-close work. I used a Princeton Headlamp but got the most use   from a PantherVision ballcap that has 2 leds embedded in the visor. Put it on in the morning and it was   there whenever I needed it.  3. Radios are a must. The Freeplay crank radios are great and a must. I also grabbed the "Safety Cross 6   in 1" crank radio/flashlight when I went somewhere - I wish it had AM but it's just FM. Two other great   radios to have are the GE Superadio and, even better, the Grundig S350. I like the Grundig best because   you can forget to leave it on and run out of batteries, a great feature. The GE Superradio sounds much   better and I used it when I needed a break from Emergency Radio to listen to real music. The GE uses 6 D   batteries and the Grundig uses 5 buy they last forever.  4. Check out the "Basepump". It's a sump pump that operates off your house's water pressure - no power   required. It can be your primary sump pump or added as a "power out backup". What a great product.  5. Didn't have a generator, would have been nice, not sure I'll get one. If you do, read the directions   and know them cold. Start the generator once every 3 months. Have an electrician rewire your box so that   you can shut your box off and power your entire house from the generator. If you are not moving for a   long time consider a natural gas backup generator. If you want something cheaper and portable everyone   raved about the newer Honda generators with the automatic cut back, low oil shutoff, etc. I think it's   the Honda EU3000is ?   6. We had trees down everywhere. I had a Fiskars axe (the lighter head) and a Fiskars hatchet: both   outstanding tools. Didn't have a chain saw but I do now, bought the smallest sthil model. You really   don't need much more than a 12-14" bar.  7. Keep some canned in your pantry. Fruit Cocktail, soup, beans, tough to eat them cold but they work 
 This is a very clearly written exposition of the major threats facing mankind in the present and near future. It provides sensible discussions of incredible dangers that most of us do not think about most of the time. It is also reasonable in understanding that the nuclear threat has not vanished with the fall of the Soviet Union but has rather transformed. It too presents a picture of possible survival through colonization of other worlds. And it proposes a whole set of possibilities of transformation of humanity into some other form of being which would make our cosmic survival more likely. Its focus however is in discussing the kinds of dangers human tampering with nature and environment bring to the future.  The  hopelessness which I personally felt in reading the work comes not only from the possibility that one of the ' doom scenarios' might be realized. It is rather from the strong feeling which Rees is not alone in presenting, that we human beings as we are, are only a temporary stage which will necessarily be transformed into some other more durable, more intelligent kind of ' thing.' I find that this approach undermines the central value of the 'human'as we know it. Human life,individual human beings, human relations in all their complexity, the human relation to the Divine seem to me to be more precious and holy,   than our ' survival ' as another ' form of being'. This book is frightening in its negative prospects but too does not console in the picture of the non- human human future, it gives.  
 I have been wearing Boxers for 2 years and i never stop wearing them. They are sexy looking. I use them for wearing underneath my pants, walking around the house in, and sleeping in. I sleep in boxers and a t-shirt. Those wimpy boys who don't wear boxers you better start wearing them. The way to look cool wearing them are going to a sleep over and sleep in them ok 
 As a child, Coolio was a B.G. LocC from Compton, CA.  Although Coolio ran with the Compton Loccs, Coolio had troubles fitting in with his school mates, and at the age of 17 Coolio got into the Crack-Cocaine game.  Although Coolio may not of been as sucessful as Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre or Snoop Doggy Dogg, Coolio's 1996 album Gangsta's Paradice is a West Coast Highlight.  Best hit defiently is the hit song Gangsta's Paradice, though another song that should of been a hit is Cruisin'.  Sumpin' New is another good hit by Coolio, and a good House Party song is Kinda High Kinda Drunk.  Coolio's best are 2, *3, 4, *5, 6, *7, *10, 12, 13, 16 & 17 
 From the time he was first sent out with Shlomo Carlebach by the then Lubavitch Rebbe  Rav Zalman has been a major Jewish outreach person. He has followed the dictates of his own heart and experience. And he has tried to make Judaism a living spiritual reality for many. There are those who say he went outside the fold in doing this, went far too far especially in his efforts at syncretic connection with other religious traditions. But there are others his followers who claim that in the words of Reb Shlomo he is the 'holiest of the holy'.  While recognizing his deep feeling for Jewish life and story, his deep readiness to feel the mystical presence of God, his hunger for life, real life in religion- I wonder if he does not make a bit too little of traditional Halachic practice, underplay the way for many observance is the key to the higher spirituality. Whatever one feels about it,  this work provides a clear and story- filled picture of Rav Zalman 's personal way of seeing his life as a Jew, and making it holy.  
 This book is an excellent  read for any artist (literary, visual, peforming, or otherwise), particularly those who are just beginning as much of the material may seem less than revolutionary to the "educated" artist. Richards' language is generally clear, and careful reading elucidates even the most convoluted of his passages. Overall an interesting book aside from a few chapters Richards spends chasing his own tail in an attempt to reconcile morality with desire 
 Kate Elliott continues to catch my interest after the first book in this series.  She provides a compelling cast of charactors and a fascinating world view 
 Is there a better album?  COME ON!  This is full of rebirth and set Dylan's sails back towards the Tracks 
 My kids really like listening to this book.  My husband and I can't stand the voice of Pooh Bear though.  I think they want him to sound dumb but it can get a little painful.  But since the kids love it so much I suffer through 
 Seriously...  anybody that rates this book anything other than 5 stars is a complete idiot.  He is a hero 
 From just the small description of this book, it has already captured my interest.  I have heard more than enough times how we very often pay more than we should for products whose price is based more on name than product.  Now we have someone who independently gives true-tested opinions of many things we may even already have in our homes.  With what we all can save, this alone pays for the price of Ms. Irons helpful books.  I can't wait to get included in the list of satisfied owners of her very affordable and useful books 
 I'm the very blessed mom of two daughers who became mine through international adoption, so this story was quite meaninful to me.  Reading about the journey of another family is both inspiring and comforting.  Sarah shares all the dimensions involved in the miracle of adoption in a beautiful way!  You'll love it 
 Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up 
 Nancy Kress' "Probability Moon" takes a little getting used to at the very beginning. Humans are traversing the stars through space tunnels they discovered, and they're finding humans scattered throughout the universe, apparently seeded by some unknown alien for an unknown purpose. They also found the Fallers, an alien race that wipes out human colonies anywhere they're found. All of this information is a little overwhelming at first and actually only background to the story at the heart of this book.  A team of scientists land on the planet World to study the people on the planet while a military team studies a manufactured moon orbiting World.  The overall plot was intriguing, but I was much more impressed by Kress' character development. She did an outstanding job creating the alien society on World and the science behind their evolution. The main characters are also interesting, well rounded people that I found fascinating to follow.   However, the science gets really deep toward the end of the book, and I found myself skipping sections that just didn't make sense to me. (Which is a little frustrating, because I wanted to know if it was true science or if she made it up for the book.) Plus, the ending (which I will not reveal) is less than satisfying. Oh, it makes sense with the way the book had gone up to that point, but I wanted more resolution. This ending just left the door wide open for the sequel 
 James Stewart wrote DisneyWar with the knowledge and support of Michael Eisner.  Eisner was initially reluctant to have an outsider see and write about the inner workings of Disney but apparently he overcame that reluctance.  Now he probably regrets it.  Not that it would have mattered in saving Eisner various high profile positions with the company.  Despite many early successes the first ten years the story of Disney -- especially since 1994 -- has been much more dramatic and truamatic than anything they have put on a screen.  As with all companies there are good decisions and there are bad decisions.  But it seems with Disney, since 1994, the bad outweighs the good.  EuroDisney has been a monumental bust.  Many of their productions have not done well.  The decision to buy Fox Family at far more than it was worth (I would love to see what Ruppert Murdoch's reaction was when Disney paid over $5 billion for that mistake) was another less than brilliant move.  The acquisition of ABC has been more troublesome than it was perhaps worth.  And on top of the Disney pyramid -- warts and all -- set Michael Eisner.  Stewart writes a scathing denunciation of the corporate Disney that most outsiders may hear only rumors and bits and pieces.  One had to figure that Eisner must have done something wrong to be ousted despite claims of great successes.  What did he and his entourage do wrong to earn the wrath of stockholders?  This book brings life to what could have been a dull study of corporate politics and in-fighting.  This book would make for an interesting movie -- one that I doubt Disney would produce 
 A Tale of Three Kings contains helpful information about how we can thrive in spite of being under the leadership of someone who abuses authority. Succinct and easy to read. Powerful. 
 This book is great for children at the elementary level.  It teaches about cooperation and how to get along with others 
 I have read this story so much the children I teach can read along with me 
 The 2 stories told in these books are just wonderful. My seven year old daughter couldn't get enough of the Doll Family and their wacky neighbors. The first book, The Doll People,  is full of adventure as the dolls try to find their missing aunt (also a doll, of course), escape a cat, keep family secrets, and encounter spiders. A wonderful story. The 2 main characters are very different, as one is a doll that belongs in a house that has been passed down through generations, and the other one is a new plastic family. Yet, they quickly become best friends willing to risk all to help each other. In the second book, The Meanest Doll in the World, the 2 best friend dolls have to deal with a meanie, and still stay friends, and stay true to their girl. Beautifully written, the complex plot enchanted not only my daughter, but my husband and myself. A must read for all! 
 I enjoyed the book because it had hundreds of animals, a great storyline and Chester's idea called for alot of teamwork 
 I loved it. Recently took a trip to New Orleans, and a side trip to New Iberia to see the area he so fondly writes about 
 My first impression upon completion of this classic World War I memoir is one of amazement. I am amazed that Mr. Junger-or anyone in those trenches-survived the hellish onslaught of trench warfare. In gruesome yet elegant detail, the author recounts his experiences as a front-line German soldier in his battles against the French and English. As the book proceeds, it seems that virtually everyone around Junger is killed or critically wounded. He is wounded himself on a regular basis, and between the constant sniping and merciless artillery bombardments, it is a wonder that anyone survived. There is no discussion of politics or even the reasons behind the war. It is simply the story of a front-line soldier doing his duty. Junger writes about his experiences in war as an almost mystical event that at times transcends the physical senses and becomes almost spiritual. I personally found this fascinating. And while the details of the book are often gruesome, the author's writing is downright exquisite. So whatever you think of him, Mr. Junger certainly had a way with words, and this memoir is a masterpiece that deserves the title of "Classic."  Ernst Junger is somewhat of a controversial figure. His apparent glorification of war and his right-wing political views have led many to view him as a precursor to Naziism. And while the Nazi's certainly admired him, most accounts show that he did not return the favor. He did indeed go on to serve as an officer in the Wehrmacht under Hitler, but this was out of loyalty to his country, rather than loyalty to the Fuehrer. In fact, he seems to have indirectly opposed the Nazi's, as witnessed by such writings as `On the Marble Cliffs.' All in all, Ernst Junger was a fascinating man, and 'Storm of Steel' is a literary masterpiece that deserves its place in history 
 This book is an example of chick lit done correctly. Maxted does a fabulous job creating a main character who is completely zany, yet totally relatable. The book contained elements of surprise and at times I found myself laughing out loud. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in an enjoyable and entertaining read 
 The "Hard Way" was a wonderful adventure to listen to. The audio version was beautifully produced and the reading was the best I have listened to. Karl Arnd 
 i've red all the books of Harrison and this one is my fav. It's more than the movie it self. All those tough romantic scenes and madness of Tristan leaving to runaway from the real life to sea. They are just perfecly written by Harrison. I first saw this book on a movie (Road House by Patric Swayze) and the man was reading it at a country home... the best place to read it...         
   Reader,    This book will open your eyes, make you think but most important motivate you to take charge of your life. As a young man I can truly say Mr Kiyosaki has implanted a mindset of hope, hunger but most vital..education.                             Enjoy sir/ m'am 
 It soon becomes apparent when reading the first few chapters of this interesting book that in this tiny part of the publishing industry were an equally small number of people (mostly males, obviously) yet they were responsible for producing millions of trash paperbacks that sold in the Fifties, Sixties and early Seventies.  This book is a celebration of their endeavours.  Because of the very competitive arena in which these publishers worked, with twenty or more new titles each month the covers were the main selling point and the three hundred plus reproduced in this book show that you don't mess with a successful formulae.  They had to show a female (unless it was for the gay market) as provocatively posed as possible with a two or three word title to complete the package.  It has to be said though that the quality of these illustrations is pretty poor which only makes the work of one or two artists really stand out.  Robert Bonfils, in particular, consistently turned out quality art and sleaze artists like Stanton, Bilbrew and Bill Ward were made for this market.  No cover design could be too tacky for this publishing genre.  The bulk of the book are the cover reproductions (each with date, publisher, author and artist credits) with several short essays in the front.  The two about soft core publishing on the East and West coasts were interesting because they actually explain the background to the publishers and more importantly how the books were distributed through the network of adult book stores in most cities and towns.  The back has a useful list of publishers and authors pseudonyms.  I was slightly disappointed with the books production though, there is no real page design, paragraphs are excessively long and columns just fall short because no one bothered to make adjustments to the picture sizes to compensate.  Despite this 'Sin-a-rama' will probably be the only book to comprehensively cover the publishing world of paperback sleaze.  ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover. 
 Without a doubt, a beautiful book beginning to end. The entire book is filled with incredible true life photos, stories and poems of companionship, love and family. Emily has reached out with diversity, sincerity and humor and captured the soul of the human and animal bond. I am personally grateful to Emily for sharing her talent, time, and resources in creating this magnificent book. Whether for your own coffee table or a gift for someone else, Tails of Devotion is a must have! With the donation of Tails of Devotion to non-profit rescue groups, this also becomes a true gift to help those than cannot speak for themselves 
 While I am generally healthy my age, lack of exercise, and too much time bent over a computer were contributing to so much stiffness and achyness that something had to change.  I am 51 and know virtually nothing about yoga.  This book gives just enough of the whole picture of yoga (spiritual, physical, breath, mental training, relaxation) that I feel like they didn't leave things out for the sake of marketablity - but didn't put more in than I cared to study at this time.  Best of all - 2 days of the suggested beginners course - and without getting terribly strict with myself to do the positions well - and i have more relief than i would have ever guessed or hoped for.  Perfect for the beginner that is not in the habit of an exercise program 
 Julie Alvarez's ("How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent") newest novel "Finding Miracles" is the story of Milly Milagros Kaufman, a typical all-American, half-Jewish high schooler with a not-so-typical secret: Milly was adopted as an infant from a war-torn Latin American country, where her adopted parents were serving in the Peace Corps.  Milly has managed to successfully keep this info from her best friend Em, friends Jake and Dylan, and the community at large, because thinking about her sickly beginnings at an orphanage dredged up too many painful questions about why she was abandoned at the doorstep, who her birth parents may have been and if they "disappeared" during the dictatorship.  Milly is forced to confront her past when Pablo Bolívar joins her grade at high school. Pablo and his parents are refugees from Milly's home country (which is never named).  One of his uncles was murdered, one of his brothers is a prisoner, and the other a revolutionary. Pablo asks Milly to help him with English in exchange for practicing Spanish, and one day makes a comment that changes Milly's life: he tells her that her eyes look like those of the mountain village Los Luceros.  Also, Milly overhears an angry family discussion in which her unhappy grandmother Happy effectively writes her out of her will as she is not a "blood" relation.  Milly begins to slowly examine her feelings by confronting "The Box," a mahogany box containing her adoption papers, naturalization papers, two locks of hair (one light, one dark), a coin, and several photos, and in a brave speech running for a class office, tells the story of her adoption to the school at large. The second half of the novel chronicles Milly's journey to her homeland. When Milly's home country is freed from tyranny and democracy is slowly put into place, she takes up Mrs. Bolívar's invitation to visit, searching for traces of her shadowy past. Milly and Paco become more than just friends, bonded by the shared sadness of having lost loved ones in the war.   The novel does not have a "fairy tale" ending where everything works out perfectly, but the ending provided a satisfying conclusion to Milly's journey.  Realistically written and beautifully described, Alvarez captures a girl torn between cultures, languages, and her past, and how Milly, now Milagros, makes all the pieces fit. 
 I just couldn't bear to let a middle school kid give this book an "average customer review" of one star.  This book is a  side-splitter.  Absolutely hysterical.  My children were rolling on the  floor.  Also get Marshall's "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" and  "Red Riding Hood" for a set of some of the best retellings ever.   Marshall's wry sense of humor makes him a favorite in our home school 
 I've always known that Flannery O'Connor was an incredible writer, but I am amazed at her ability to fully explain her craft.  She is extremely witty and graceful.  She provides a glimpse into the strategy and  "mystery" of fiction writing.  Everyone who enjoys reading  fiction, or strives to create their own should purchase this book 
 I'll say this with every Pac album that I review: I'm not one of those people who consistantly ride his nuts like half the world does, and calls him the greatest lyricist in rap/hip hop music.   But Pac was very talented here in 1995 with his album "Me Against The World". Around this time he was 1. In trouble with the law, and aquitted of various charges; 2. Just signed to Deathrow Records; 3. Feeding into his beef with Bad Boy Records. But Pac himself would have an enjoyment here behind the mic while recording this album. Pac would show a little introspective side on many tracks. That would show especialy on the big hit song "Dear Mama" a song dedicated to his mother, as well as "Young ******".   Hence the opening paragraph that I made about me not saying he is the greatest lyricst, he would have a few that I liked. "It Ain't Easy" and "If I Die 2 Nite" are prime examples of Pac lyricism here on this album. Pac would also get a lot of heat off of his chest with my favorite song by him till this day "**** The World" and the soft sounding, but hard track "Lord Knows". The intensity of his voice in that song makes me like it, along with the back vocals of Shock G.  So here, Pac dropped an excellent LP here in '95. The Source took another listen and in 2002, awarded him the 5 mic rating (the origional this album received was 4). This album is a great addition to any one's hip hop collection. It is the satisfaction guranteed to give anyone the enjoyment that he or she desires. Word.  Lyrics: A+ Production: A Guest Appearances: A Musical Vibes: A Overall: A  Favorite Tracks: If I Die Tonight, Me Against The World, So Many Tears, Temptations, Young ******, Dear Mama, It Ain't Easy, Lord Knows, **** The World  Honorable Mention Track: Old School  Peace Everyone!! 
 And even then, you have a very good chance of appreciating the amount of insight that Dr. Oliver Sacks has into the minds and lives of his patients, and into life and the human condition in general. Sacks, both the author and the narrator in this book, has chosen some of his favorite, poignant, and exemplary cases from the many patients he has worked with in his home for those with neurological disorders (or, more romantically, a home for those who see the world in a completely different way.). Not only does he describe the disease and condition of the patient, he describes the life, the person, behind the disease. In some cases, he also updates the information he has with the specific patient, i.e., what the patient has gone on to do, or not to do, with their life.  Since this book is a reprint of the original version, a postscript after some of the stories describe similar patients, revelations that he has had, and the medical advances that have been made since the original writing. These also include incredible insight, as well as a sense of hindsight and fondness on the part of Sacks.   As both the writer and the narrator, Sacks exhibits both his impressive clinical knowledge and his personal feelings on each case: it is obvious in reading this book that he cared about and was interested in the well being (or, if well being was impossible, simply the being) of his patients. His writing makes each of these stories, for the most part, assessable to anyone, regardless of their previous knowledge on the subjects of psychology and neurology or attention span: these short stories are comprehendible and, for the most part, concise, and are written in such a way that the reader gets drawn into the story of the patient and feel, at least partially, invested in their health as well, and make you want to keep on reading to find out how, if at all, they were cured or treated.  Whether the story is comic or tragic, whether you want to do a little more general research on neurological disorders, or if you just want to feel lucky that your body and mind work to the capacity that they do, Dr. Sacks' book The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat will keep you both informed and entertained. You don't have to be crazy to read this book, but if you are, I'm sure Dr. Sacks would understand. 
 Upgraded from 32" Sony WEGA to the 5087W - what a difference!  Even my wife, who doesn't really care or pay attention to electronics, keeps telling me how much of an improvement this TV is.  We love watching DVDs and sports on it, as well as HDTV Cable broadcasts.  The color is vivid, the screen bright, and the sound is even very good.  My transaction with Amazon was good, though it took awhile to get to me with free shipping, the delivery folks were very accomodating, carefully unpacking the box, and helped me set the TV up.  I couldn't be more pleased with this Samsung 
 7 Card Stud by Roy West is a solid book for beginning players.  Not complete beginners, but beginners nonetheless.  The first 26 lessons are on 7 Card Stud in medium and lower limits, the next 12 are on general poker issues, and the last 4 are written by Tom McEvoy on Stud tournaments.  I found the book to be good for players that need to be told how to play, although not necessary why to play in a certain way.  West advice is to play tight and aggressive when you have the best of it.  But sometimes, his advice seems too much on the tight and conservative side.  Maybe this is good for the beginning player (to play too conservatively), since most players in the medium and lower limits have the exact opposite problem (they play too loose).  For most beginners who are too loose, they are going to benefit from this book.  If they follow the West's advice to be tight, they will likely improve their results.    
 This immunology textbook has been what many bioloy students are waiting for.  Among other well-known texts, this book is the thinest.  However, the materails contained are so comprehensive that it can be used as a regular  textbook.  There are not many illustrations in this book as you usually see  in a typical immunology book but these group of authors have done a nice  job describing many difficult topics ( such as immunoglobulin gene  rearrangement, B and T cell maturation, complement, Hypersensitivity etc.)  easier and clearer by using simple language.  Moreover,this new edition has  been updated with very recent knowledge of immunology.  If you anyhow don't  like Kuby or Janeways' books, this book can be another excellent one 
 It is difficult to call a memoir from the Vietnam War enjoyable.  Perhaps engrossing or compelling are better words. But I simply could not put this book down.  Wolff's crystal clear writing style is wonderful. With very few words, he captures the feel, the emotions and, in many cases, the morality of the incidents he recounts.  In a short 220 pages, the author follows his almost accidental path from deck hand on a boat to army enlistee to paratrooper to officer to military advisor and back to civilian.  The incidents he describes are entertaining.  Some are laugh out loud funny. Some are sad. But all serve to either deliver lessons he learned or to describe the absurdities of war and/or the characters one encounters along the way.  This very personal retrospective on Vietnam contains a wealth of both entertainment and wisdom.  I recommend it highly to anyone interested in the personal side of war, and particularly to any man who wore a uniform during the 1960's.           
 i very much enjoyed reading this book.ansay is a beautiful writer although there are a few times where it seems she is trying too hard,and it doesn't flow as well.they probably just stand out in contrast to the rest of the prose,however.the people and places she talks about really come alive. i can relate to a lot of the catholic upbringing,though her experience of it was more intense than mine.the conclusions she comes to at the end of the book are not for the philosophically naive,and are reminiscent of much of eastern philosophy. however,i think there are more chapters to follow,and i hope someday she will write another installment as her life unfolds further 
 This photography book is simply stunning.  From the many shots of male models, actors, and just everyday joes...this book rocks.  The price tag is hefty but is very worth it.  The price alone was worth it for those pictures of Brad Pitt and Antonio Sabato Jr.!  Mr. Pierson definitely knows what's attractive to the eye and who his core audience is:)  The photo's of the male models are also fantastic.  I personally know the cover model and all I can say is, Congratulations Lenny! You deserve all the attention!  You won't be disappointed 
 In Book 6 of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, the author allows his characters to really come into their own. The addition of a new member to the crew at Tlokweng Speedy Motors/No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is of great benefit to the narrative. The book starts off with a mystery and has a bit more of a "Murder She Wrote" type feel to it than the other books in the series. The return of a figure from Mma Ramotswe's past brings about a deeper sense of introspection from her character. Fans of Mma Makutsi will be happy to know that her storyline finally develops. This is definitely the best of the six novels and Smith seems to grow more and more as a writer with each novel in the series 
   In 1985, three teenagers are murdered in Washington D.C. Each of the victims have names that form palindromes - Otto, Ava and Eve. At the scene are T. C. Cook, hard-boiled Detective Sargeant and two near-rookies, Gus Ramone and Dan "Doc" Holiday. The Palindrome murders are never solved despite the obsession and skills of Cook. Flash forward to 2005. Gus Ramone is married now and has two mixed-race children. Dan Holiday left the police force under a cloud. T. C. Cook, long retired, has been forgotten by nearly all, along with the Palindrome murders.    But Asa Johnson, 14, is found dead with a bullet through his brain. No gun. No witnesses. Could the Palindrome murderer be back after a 20 year absence?    The hunt for the murderer of Asa Johnson is the leitmotif for this compelling, if sometimes very quirky,police procedural.    Gus Ramone is the central character. No superman, Ramone is career cop. Not burned out, but not an over-acheiver either. Ramone, of Italian/Hispanic ancestry has a black wife, Regina, and two kids: Diego, 14, and Alana, 7. Gus loves his wife and children dearly. His love for them and the problems of bringing a mixed-race male through the storms of adolescence form the second leg of the story.    Holiday and Ramone have a "history." Holiday is convinced he was a great cop and would have become a legenday cop if it weren't for the straight-laced Ramone in the Internal Affairs Division. Holiday discovers the body of the teenage Asa Johnson and phones the police anonymously. Holiday then teams up with the real legend, T. C. Cook to prove that the Palindrome murderer is back - and to capture him. This is the third leg of the story.    The fourth leg is an unsparing tale of the black criminal subculture. This is not for the overly sensitive.    These four themes support some of those most masterful storytelling I've seen in a long time. Pelecanos has the workaday world of the police down pat. No superheroics: just hard work, persistence and some specially skilled people like Bo Greene, who is able to talk murderers into confessing.    Ramone has a special interest in the murder of Asa Johnson, not because it is his case - which it is not - but because Asa was a friend of his son. Ramone's work on the case leads down some dark paths, which also brings Pelecanos into some very strange and frankly hypocritical sermonizing. Saying anything more than that would be a spoiler and I won't do that. Concurrent with Ramone's investigation, is the work of Holiday and Cook. Ramone and Holiday seem to bewalking down the road to a showdown.    Despite the unwelcome and unnecessary excursions into cultural politics, "The Night Gardener" is a terrific police procedural and a social commentary as well. Well worth reading.  Jerr 
 I purchased this book after finding out that I had leaky gut syndrome - the information provided is good, recommended treatments is the standard throughout the alternative world for this problem.   The down side is that no cases studies or persoanl experiences are available 
 This movie would have to be one of the most overrated film adaptations of any of Stephen King's books. What you have are 4 losers who go in search of a dead body so that they can get onto the televison nightly news and become "Celebrities". This shows you how sensitive these four kids are. Then to show their delicate sensibilities each one takes his turn at bawling his eyes out. This movie stars the late River Phoenix who was a very Health Conscious guy. He didn't smoke or eat meat but he did like heroin which led to his demise. Sadly both Stephen King and the director of this trash Rob Reiner have confused the experience of adoloescent with a "Sensitivity Training Workshop". And by the way how come everybody in the audience expels blueberry pies? Did they all have the same thing for lunch as the guys in the Pie Eating Contest?I give this movie 5 stars because the Oregon Vistas are quite nice 
 Films of faith this is a terrific set and I have really made a great investment here.Each of the movies are very clear and sharp.The shoes of the fisherman is extremely good in the widescreen format and the sound is terrific in 5.1 Dolby surround.It was the first time that I had seen the shoes of the fisherman as it was intended in widescreen,and apreciated it so much, having seen it before on video in the pan and scan format.WB.has done it again,well done.Well done amazon for having stocked such great classic as this set i 
 Outstanding quality, consistency and accuracy!  At the end of the day that is all you can ask from a blood pressure cuff (sphygmomanometer).  A few things to bear in mind:  In consecutive readings done at the same time, you will see a trend from higher to lower blood pressure as you "learn" to lower your own pressure.  Also, your blood pressure at home will be lower than that you obtain at your doctor's office until you learn to overcome the anxiety normally associated with the doctor's office.  This is normal and is one of the main reasons to obtain a home blood pressure monitor.  Also, your pressure will fluctuate from day to day and even during a blood pressure monitoring session.  So don't automatically assume that the gauge is not giving accurate readings!  Trust me, it is.  This monitor has been extensively tested against measurements obtained at the doctor's office and has been determined to be as accurate a method of determining blood pressure as you would obtain at the doctor's office - actually, more accurate since the anxiety factor is eliminated.    So if you are looking for the best home blood monitor device on the market look no further.  Just made sure and trust it!  I heartily endorse this product 
 I was very impressed with how quickly my order was filled. I live three states away and my order came within 24 hrs! Thank you 
 We bought the book and look at the teaching methodolgies in details. There are 4 key points which we find it very revelant in today's schools. Suitable for Grade1-6. We welcome readers of this book to share their thoughts with us 
 I was so pleased to discover this in a comic bookstore in downtown Manhattan.  Its a fairly short but sweet graphic novel detailing a night in the life of a pro wrestler out to protect his family from some gruesome freaks straight out of the Hills Have Eyes.  If you're as much a fan as I am of Rob Zombie's films or his music for that matter you have got to pick up a copy of this asap.  I only wish there were more.  *Supposedly rumor has it this may wind up being made into a movie as well as his other collaboration with Steve Niles -- The four part Bigfoot series.  Rob Zombie is awesome 
 M. Owen Lee is perhaps best known to opera lovers through his appearances on the Texaco Opera broadcasts, some of which have formed the core of two of his previous books. In his latest book, Father Lee demonstrates the personally committed criticism which is characteristic of his radio  lectures.  This is no mere apologia for Wagner. The author is painfully  aware of Wagner's human failings, not merely the oft-discussed  anti-Semitism, and he is troubled by the fact that the music of such a  monster could move him so deeply. This book gives us a wonderful insight  into the author's soul as he grapples with this question. I especially  enjoyed the discussion of "Tannheuser" in the final chapter. (A  few years ago I wrote to him about his love of Wagner, and he cared enough  to write me a detailed letter in response--another sign of his genuine  commitment to the subject). This book tells us not only about Wagner but  also about the author himself, who has a unique capability of engaging the  reader in a genuine dialogue 
 If you enjoyed the movie (havent laughed so much in ages), the soundtrack is a must have! Full of funny, raunchy songs. Let's Go Sexin'! Eager Beaver Baby! Tony's Got Hot Nuts! Need I say more? Loads of fun. Great party music, but not for the kiddies 
      In a word, WOW.  This book is ranked in the top five greatest books that I've ever read.  Clancy uses incredibly specific and intricate descriptions of the nautical military to create a real life atmosphere that the reader can relate to.  Real military events were used to shape the plot of the story, and Amazon.com even states that Clancy was rumored to have been debriefed by the White House during the production of this novel.            Clancy also creates an easy way for the reader to understand the complexity of the characters.  He uses events from his own life to shape the personality of Jack Ryan, the main character.  With character traits that were founded on the experiences of a real-life person, the reader is able to relate to Jack Ryan as if he was a member of reality.            Finally, the theme presented in this book can teach the everyday consumer a very valuable lesson - never jump to conclusions.  As Jack Ryan's actions are carried out during the story, he constantly gives a base for this moral to grow off of.  By reading and learning the depths of Jack Ryan's personality,  we as a society can learn to live by this theme, and greatly enhance our everyday lives 
 If you want to serve a perfect dish of spaghetti or noodles, I highly recommend this kitchen tool. It will keep the pasta untangled and aids greatly in transferring the pasta from pot to serving dish. The pasta won't break, meaning the pasta stays attractive. This is absolutely one of my favorite kitchen gadgets 
 My two-year-old daughter loves this book. Her preschool recommended it, and when I first saw it, I thought she might be frightened by it.  Not the case.  She loves reading it at night before bed, and she talks about it during the day.  It teaches a great concept:  Mommy comes back.  It's and easy read with repetition (which kids love), and the illustrations are different than most children's books.  She loves looking at the "owl babies" and especially loves the drawings of the Mother Owl.  I highly recommend this book for your toddler and/or preschooler!  
 My son has outgrown this title and now is excited about "My Fantastic Field Trip To The Planets,"  a new DVD that really explores the planets in a narrative adventure format.  However, my baby girl now watches "Baby Galileo" and absolutely loooooves it!  
 Deep Purple's Machine Head is essential for any fan of hard rock music.  Highlights: The whole thing.  Buy it; enjoy 
 I collect this work in different formats. This particular book is very good. I recommend everyone reading the Rubaiyat at least once in their lifetime. It is an excellent poetic examination of Man's purpose and Man's relation with God. One can appreciate the Rubaiyat only for its beautiful poetic images or explore it over and over for its deeper philosophical nuances. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is ever a delight no matter how you prefer it.  
 I am crazy about Splenda.  I mix equal parts Splenda And Brown sugar for my hot cerael.  It saves money and calories.  Asparteem   ( Nutrasweet)gives me loose bowels.  Splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories 
 Considering that three of the four of the novellas were made into major motion pictures, the pictures do capture the essence of the original text.  I saw the film, "The Shawshank Redemption" before having read the novel, and I couldn't believe that such a story line could fit into so few pages!  King touches upon many tastes in this novel.  I think that "Apt Pupil" tends to be the most "horrific", and suprisingly, is my least favorite.  As an animal lover, I object to some of the actions in this story, but it didn't stop me from reading or loving the story.    If you're not a typical King fan, this book my change your mind, at least for the length of the novel.  His "narrator" theme is always someone involved in the story, and not your omniscent or first person, either.    Give it a try, it is highly recommended. 
 Theodore Sizer has cranked out a cottage industry's worth of books all focused on illuminating the absurdity of the current school system and offering a well-reasoned model for redesigning those schools to achieve the  purposes for which they are funded.  He is the voice of the "Coalition  of Essential Schools"  model for reform.  Each book uses a fictitious  "Horace" for dramatic dialogue, following "Horace's  Compromise" which communicated Sizer's research findings in 1982.  His  very readable style, primarily narrative rich with anecdotes of the many  schools he personally visited, established him as a popular and credible  author.  You don't have to have a graduate degree in education to  understand him or to feel as if you, too, could be instrumental in change  after you have red his books.  One innovation I like is the inclusion of  literature in the arts--a clear challenge to the College Board's  traditional division of disciplines, and the plea to liberate schools from  curriculum a mile wide and an inch deep:  "less is more".  A good  companion author is John Goodlad 
 HIGHLY ADVISABLE FOR ANESTHETIST PREPARING FOR THEIR BOARD EXA 
 I love McEwan's writing enough to forgive him for the few faults this novel almost conceals.  At its best, the prose evokes Fitzgerald's effortless beauty.  At worst, it feels showy, or show-offy:  18 pages to describe a squash match?  No need.  We GET it.  Ian knows squash, Ian knows fine wine and food, Ian knows Neurosurgery, Ian knows Blues.  The problem is that the novel Hangs too long, or too deeply on each of these subjects.  Ok, so the book is only about one day in this guy's life, one 24 hours of his hyper-consciousness, and as a result it HAS to go deep.  Still, I felt at times like McEwan was showing off, not just showing 
   This book is really great.  At first, I put off reading it because of the title and the bright blue and yellow cover. I'd read other similar titles and didn't feel like I got much out of them, or they presented lengthy exercises and didn't offer much real-life advice.   I just thought it might be too much psycho bable for me, but I was soon presently suprised when I actually began reading Stephen Pollan's book.   This book is really amazing.  It offers information anyone can understand and adapt in their daily life.  Yeah, there is no ONE thing to make your life 100% better in one split second, but did you really think any similar books or this book would offer some magical tip to instantly make your life better??  If they did, it certainly would be short-lived.  Instead, this book offers real life tips, amazing quotes, and actual representations of how you can put these thoughts and activities into action.      The quotes throughout the pages are probably worth the price of the book itself.  I love all of them, and am planning to go back through and select a couple for other uses.     This book is really great though.  I've read several other titles, and none were so straight forward, easy to understand, and easily applied as the techniques and ideas in this book.  I think many people would be able to benefit this book whether you are unhappy in your life or if you've just hit a snag working towards the goals in your life.  This book will inspire you, put you back on track, and show you how to find the happiness that was already inside of you to begin with.  Definitely a good read!  It's also really up-tp-date with information as of 2006. 
 The only complaint that I can think of is the non-chalant disrespect for religion, at least to some degree.  I otherwise enjoy what the author has to say about the current state of our nation 
 Kitty City:  A Feline Book of Hours caught my attention because of the author's name, Judy Chicago.  I have always admired her work in the world of fine arts.  This book is a wonderful surprise.  It is beautifully illustrated and truly influenced by the illuminated Book of Hours treasured during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The pleasing illustrations are enhanced by the use of gold and vellum.   To my delight, the reader is allowed a very intimate look at the life of the artist with her husband and their feline family. The day-to-day joys as well as life's harsh reality in the loss of a loved one.  Kitty City makes a great gift for anyone that has ever loved an animal or is interested in feline history and feline facts of life. Little known tidbits about cats and their place in the world add to the uniqueness of this book.       
 "Out of the Box" will open your heart to the unconscious world of people's deep motives, a 'secret garden' that is invisible to almost everyone.  But this garden is "hidden in plain view!"  The authors guide you to readily see through the facade of casual social interaction into people's souls.  "Out of the Box" has been a gift of multiple breakthroughs: * in my understanding of people generally * in my ability to reach and make a difference for the people I care about * in my self-development as a business coach and husband.  The writing is deep and rich, replete with wisdom.  The book is all substance with zero fluff.  The authors have chosen their words very carefully to convey precise messages clearly.  "Out of the Box" is more than deep: It is also breezy and entertaining.  It is an easy read because of its many stories of deep encounters with real people.  It brings peoples' deep motives alive in your heart as well as your mind.  The authors appeal to your heart for deep transformation.  Any experienced coach knows how key this is.  Many teachers teach this, but "Out of the Box" demonstrates how to do it.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to know people deeply, and especially for those who care to help people become the "Captains of their Souls."  You will be better able to guide someone you care about past their submerged "rocks in the water" to safe harbor in the land of their dreams. 
 You know, if you want to be the best, you need to learn from the best. George & Donald are the pinnacles of success in the real estate business. George Ross presents how things work with him & Donald in the business world, from his perspective. I highly recommend it. I have far more respect for George now after reading this book 
 An excellent gift for a gay male friend 
 My first grade students love this book!  It is equally valued by my gifted and also struggling students.  The children use it in a story writing center to help when they need to spell a word, or get ideas.  This book is arranged by themes rather than alphabetically, for example, there is a 2 page spread of food words.  This helps the students who are not ready to look up words alphabetically.  The pictures are bright and clear.  The book is sturdy enough to survive being handled daily by several students.  Easily 5 stars! 
 This book is basically a transcript of a series of lectures Professor Feynman gave at UCLA and in New Zealand.  The lectures were given at the University of Auckland in New Zealand because Feynman wanted to "try out" the lectures on people far from home to see if they would work. [...] The book  QED attempts successfully to give the reader an idea of how light works at a fundamental level and is actually very weird and untuitive due to our inherited and evolved senses and perception.  Feynman preps the reader to anticipate these very strange unintuitive scientific findings and goes on to explain them very well 
 With a colorful name like this you would think he would be better known for his role in WWII.  Vinegar Joe Stilwell was slated to be the Commander of Allied forces in the North African campaign.  Unfortunately for Vinegar Joe that was not to be and the job ended up going to Eisenhower.  Due to Vinegar Joe's Chinese language ability he ended up working in China with Chiang Kae-shek.  Vinegar Joe led the allied efforts in China, Burma, Northern India, and Thailand.  He was the ranking officer onboard the Missouri when Japan surrendered.  As far as military books go this one is a bit dry at times.  It is lacking when it comes to campaign maps.  It is also a little tough to follow at times. That being said it is a very good book for a scarcely covered topic.  It shows the tenacity of Japanese fighters and the extreme lengths they went to in their campaigns.  It even goes into the politics and corruption that caused China to fall to Communist forces.  Also shows how politicians sacrificed their Generals when they were no longer useful.  All in all this is a very good book for anyone interested in military history, strategy, and politics. 
 Being a huge fan of the first book DUNE I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this book as much as I did. Everything familar to the DUNE universe has changed with time, as things always do, yet enough of the familiar remains to tie in the new characters into overall storyline. I found the charaters in "Heretics" to be every bit as deep and complex as those found in the original DUNE, and I thoroghly enjoyed getting to know them as much as I did those of the old Empire, especially Dar. The story has a great pace and the book was a blast to read 
 This book is great for anyone who is interested in fantasy or Lord of the Rings but doesn't want to take the time in effort to read them.It is also good as a prelude to the series altough I'd recommend the Silmarillion too.It is a short little book about a sensible and yet adventurous Hobbit who goes on an adventure with Gandalf the wizard and a group of dwarves to find a lost treasure guarded by a dragon in a far away land.There are many references to the Lord of the Rings books such as the finding of the Ring and Gollum,Mirkwood and the wood elves(Legolas' kin),and Sauron(the Necromancer).It is a fun book that you can probably finish in a week without too much effort.Not deep like the Lord of the Rings,but fun,active,and adventurous so it's great for kids as well as adults.I was disappointed with the ending,however,because it did seem rather anti-climactic 
 I just finished Winged Victory last night. It really tells two stories in tandem, one is telling the day to day life of a squadron as they fly combat missions in Camels over the western front and the other is the account of the mental anguish the main character endures as the pressure of war and death become more and more unbearable. At its core the book is a tragedy with the theme being the hopelessness of war and how it destroys the living as well as the dead.  As far as the flying and combat,  the book is really good. Yeats goes into detail about the Camel and what it was like to fly it. Most all of the novel is describing combat over the front; bombing, strafing and dogfighting. There is no shortage of action and it is all told well by a man who saw it all. Yeats loved to fly but hated to kill and sadly that is what these machines were all about. 
 This is one of my all time favorites in the acton adventure category.  It really is a must see about submarines.  It is just really a stimulating movie.  It is so much better than a bond movie and I love bond 
 It is little wonder why the leaders at Toyota give Henry Ford the credit for leading them to the promised land of LEAN and TPS. He was way ahead of his time and in some respects his vision is still way ahead of our time. What an amazing personality, mind, and story 
 You might have to be a serious TOOL fan to really appreciate this cd as it is not the typical stuff they put out.  There are two long songs dedicated to Maynard's mother who passed away in '03 that refer to her very religious beliefs and his frustration with it.  He sings the lyrics softly and there are only a few intense guitar rifs that get your head banging.  But the content of the lyrics are very meaningful and that is something that I've always loved about TOOL.  The rest of the songs are more their usual style.  Yah!  In my opinion the entire cd is INCREDIBLE.  They only get better with age.  They continue to grow as humans and reflect that in their music.  If you follow Maynard at all and are aware of his struggle with his Mom's religious beliefs the two songs dedicated to his Mom may really hit you.  I couldn't listen to "10,000 days" (the song) without bawling for the first couple of months I listened to it.  And I listened to it over and over...   As usual, the lyrics will get you thinking and the music will get you moving.  Gotta love TOOL!!! 
 This book is an excellent supplement for teaching employee training and development as a course. I'd recommend combining it with Noe's text (Employee Training and Development) for a college or graduate level course on this subject. The book is also a good stand-alone reference for teaching aspects of active training to a firm's curriculum development staff 
 Frontier Living illuminates all aspects of daily life on the American frontier, from the log cabin to the ranchero. Black and white illustrations by the author provide embellishments to text which describe frontier daily life; from tools and clothing to food. A recommended pick for students of early American frontier days 
 Away From Home: American Indian Boarding School Experiences is a magnificent collection of writings, poems, photographs, and paintings and illustrations that document American Indian boarding school experiences in the U. S. between 1879-2000. It was collected as a part of a display on exhibit at the Heard Museum until 2005. From the beautiful but sad painting on the cover (Untitled oil on canvas by Angel de Cora, Winnebago) to the dozens of historical photographs within of different aspects of the various Native American boarding school histories, to the poignant letters, poems, and memories of the many contributors, Away From Home is a revelation of repressed racial memories that underlines the need for dialogue specifically with Native voices in order to accept responsibility as well as to encompass and "enrich our view of America's past, present and future (Page 135, Brenda Child)." Away From Home presents a rich assortment of written and pictured memories from such boarding schools as Carlisle Indian School of Pennsylvania, Sherman Indian School, Riverside, California, and Flandreau Indian School, South Dakota. Both the many negative and some surprising positive aspects of boarding school existence are explored. The shattering impact on family and ethnic identification of the boarding school student is not avoided. The notion that perhaps an apology is owed to present day survivors' descendants is actually obliquely presented in a referent to the "Sorry Day" movement of Aboriginal people in Australia. At least the impact of exhibits and books such as Away From Home contain the impetus to a needed dialogue that has yet to be fully heard. Away From Home is a rich collection, filled with many voices and bitter experiences that were braided into strengths. It is a treasure and a measure of the many colors of beauty in the human spirit 
 I came to Amazon to buy a copy of this book for a gift, and read some AWFUL reviews about it, and yet to MY view, there's no question that this is ABSOLUTELY the best book ever written about South Beach. OK, our main character Hugo is a bit "wise" for a 16-year-old, and his references, allusions, etc., are over the head of most kids his age today (or in '93 when this was written), but for quality of tone, an on-the-mark conceit about South Beach and characters that ring true for South Beach, no book written before or after this one comes close to capturing what the environment (and the people) are really like down here. And who says you have to "like the characters" to have a "good book"? Any of these reviewers ever read a guy named Shakespeare? I'll stick with Hugo. 
 I have read a number of the reviews of this book, and I feel that some of them give a bit of a mis-impression about what this book is about.  It is not about picking stocks, it is first and foremost an overview of various theories of behavioral finance/investment psychology.  In particular, it focuses on how human psychological foibles may preclude individuals (individually and in the aggregate) from acting in their own best interests.  The book no more supports efficient market theory than it supports technical analysis (e.g., the book takes shots at both).  The book does a good job of reviewing various human psychological foibles and how they may affect stock market investing, including "anchoring effect," "availability error," "confirmation bias," "status quo bias," and "endowment effect." I found the overview of these issues to be quite useful, and since reading the book 5 months ago, have tried to review them periodically to (hopefully) minimize their effect on my own investment decision making.  Paulos does a great job of debunking the notion that a particular formula may lead to stock market success.  One quote stands out: "If you look hard enough, you can always find some seemingly effective rule that resulted in large gains over a certain time frame or within a certain sector."    In sum, Paulos' conclusion is that humans are overly-fixated on short-term results, and that people do not have a set of fixed preferences upon which they cooly and rationally base their investment decisions.  Rather, because of the prevalence of fads, fashions, imitative behavior, etc., humans often act irrationally.  His book provides a nice framework for investors to analyze their own decision-making process to (hopefully) improve their results.  There are a number of other books that readers might find interesting/helpful, including:  Belksy - "Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them" (more behavioral finance discussion) Dreman - "Contrarian Investment Strategies: the Next Generation" (author uses behavioral finance theories, including those referenced by Paulos, to improve returns) Whitman - "Value Investing" and "The Aggressive Conservative Investor" (author supports a fundamental analysis that avoids a focus on short-term earnings 
 I used my new Black & Decker Cordless scrubber for the first time yesterday.  I was thrilled with the results!  I have severe arthiritis in both thumb joints.  This scrubber did a fantastic job in my very neglected  calcified showerstall.  We have very hard water, and the scrubber got into the tightest places along the shower door and frame.  I simply sprayed my cleaner and limeaway product on the walls, left for 20 minutes, and then scrubbed away!  It was sparkling clean, with no need to scrub a second time.  My thumbs felt great, and we thank you 
 LOVE IT!!!  Every young girl, teenage girl, and woman should read this book! 
 A good read.  Mallaby writes well; provides well-balanced multiple perspectives about James Wolfensohn, before and during his tenure at World Bank.  I found the case studies on Bosnia and Uganda particularly interesting.  They illuminated so many facets of how Wolfensohn and the World Bank evolved their development perspectives and policies, and were part of broader context of multiple nations as shareholders.  Also provides interesting history of Bank's various presidents and their relationship to US political sponsors.  The book is definitely not a hagiography, nor a hatchet job.  To this outside spectator it is both plausible in its balance and persuasive in its insights 
 For Sci-Fi enthusiasts, this is a must. Based on Harry Harrison's "Make room ! Make room !", the movie shows an apocalyptic (..but indeed possible..) situation in year 2020. Don't miss it ! 
 Great reprint of this great classic science fiction / fantasy series.  Much appreciated.  Looking forward to purchasing the remainder of the series when they are published 
 Annie Wilkes is off the chain. You all know that this book is about  Paul Sheldon who gets into a car accident because he was all buzzed up with don pariogone. Then this psychotic biach (Annie) takes Paul and "nurses" him if thats what you wanna call it.Then she dause stuff to him that you need to find out by reading this amazingly written book. If you've seen the movie then you stillhave to read this book it's that good 
 After spending considerable time researching true universal remote controls I chose the MX-800 which was a great choice for a home theater. The PC-connectivity (works great with Virtual PC or Boot Camp for OS X with a serial/USB adapter) for programming the remote, the ability to rename the LCD buttons, move programmed buttons around, sophisticated macro abilities and the MX-800's excellent learning from other remotes abilities set it apart from other universal remotes. This is the one to get if you want great performance and a reasonable price. Price is relative, of course, but the MX-800 is comparable with the high-end home theater remote systems, not your $50 "universal remote" money-wasters that never really work "universally". Real universal remotes like the MX-800 really do work with any device. Don't be fooled into buying battery-eating touch-screen remotes; you want the ability to flip through channels and other settings by touch, not by looking at a touch-screen whenever you want the volume up or change channels. The approach of the Home Theater Master remotes is ease of use through the buttons (all of which are programmable) and they've designed an LCD display that makes sense for real day-to-day use instead of a screen with impressive-looking but useless graphics to impress your guests. You'll be happier in the long run with a remote that is easy to use and does the job superbly than you will be that one time wow-ing your Uncle Billy with the big remote that's hard to use 
 I really liked this book. It was a sweet story. And I liked that the main charecter wasnt some beatiful girl like in a lot of stories out today 
 When I first read that Romaine Patterson and others had done the number with the angels at Laramie, it sounded like just another  passive gay event and not nearly confrontational enough. After having read and seen THE LARAMIE PROJECT and having read Ms. Patterson's account of what happened, I see that I was wrong and that this little bit of theatre did work. Anyone who could shut down Fred Phelps and his crowd is to be commended. The phrase that comes to mind about him is the banality of evil.  This book is certainly worth reading and needed to be done. Ms. Patterson was one of Matthew Shephard's closest friends, and his life and death captured the hearts of America, at least for a short time. I don't expect these kinds of narratives to be well-written; this one is. Ms. Patterson, in addition to discussing her friendship with Matthew Shepard and his effect on her life, also writes about growing up in rural Wyoming, as a teenager coming out as a lesbian with the accompanying problems and the deaths of both her brother from AIDS and her father from cancer.  Everyone who knows Ms. Patterson, including Judy Shepard who bears witness in her foreword, seems to think that the writer is above all else honest. I'm not sure that she isn't too honest. For example, she tells us that on two separate occasions she took a thousand dollars, one for an interview and the other for the sale of a photograph of Matthew. Additionally it appears that she was at times used by the media. Her account of being wired and going to the infamous fence with reporters in order that they could record her reactions has circus written all over it. On the other hand, she was what, 20, 21, and was emotionally fragile from a lot of events: Matthew's death, the death of her brother, her relationship with her girl friend. In short, let's not crucify her for trying to tell the truth.  I did not learn a great deal about the life of Matthew Shepard from this book. His parents may be the ones to write the definitive story of his life if it needs to be written. On the other hand, it really doesn't matter who he was or whether or not he was depressed or used drugs or was HIV positive. What matters is that he was a decent young man who didn't deserve what happened to him. In a strange way, Matthew became everyone's kid brother and many of us were traumatized in a way we did not expect by his death. After all, homophobia is not a new evil. Anita Bryant is now ancient history, but Matthew's death-- and do I have a right to call him by his first name?-- went to the very soul of America-- and the whole world as well. Of course for the most part legislators did not rush to state capitols to pass hate crimes legislation. As Ms. Patterson writes, the citizens of Laramie would like to forget about this case and get on with their lives. Of course, this sort of violence toward gay people or anyone who is different from the perpetrators will happen again, not necessarily in Wyoming, but around the world.   
 One VanDamme's earlier and better movies, good action and storyline. The fighting styles from all over the world are awesome just to know the different techniques that different martial artists' use. 
 Ingersoll wrote of a Republican party that still remembered the meaning of republic, before it became the haven of the religious right.  A man who could have been President easily, but chose personal integrity over political ambition.  The great agnostic was never an atheist, he may have lived the best Christian life of the 19th Century.  This book makes you want to weep when we think of all the great men that are overlooked because their truth was unpopular, while we glorify the Andrew Jackson and omit his Indian Removal Act from high school history books 
 I have had a basic understanding of electricity and electronics since I was a kid.  This book took me to a whole new level of understanding in a thorough and easy-to-understand format.  The information has helped me to better understand the electrical system on my sailboat.  I highly recommend this book to any do-it-yourselfer as well as anyone who just wants a better understanding of what is going on with the electrical system on your boat 
 I absolutely Love all of Nicholas Sparks' books. I have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you. Exciting/Compelling You can't go wrong here.  And I always preorder his new ones..... I'm addicted 
 I have enjoyed this CD every since it's release. My favorites are "For You I Sing This Song," "Funny(How Things Change)," "Changes," "Sweetest Things" & of course "Good  Lover." I just recently found it on CD and just have not been able to  take it out of my CD Changer. Sarah Webb is an excellent vocalist and one  of my all-time favorites. I have yet to check out other releases by this  group! This CD has made me really want to purchase everything they've ever  done! It's truly has not recieved the praise it so well deserves. I would  love to see this group live also! I enjoyed Track 7 (CD Bonus Track) called  "Instantly." Has a live jazz club feel to it! Which was  excellent 
 This soundtrack is very good.  They are so explosive, tense and of course, it does match the total excitement for this movie.  For example, I like several tracks including track 1, 4, 7, 18, 19 and 20.  They are simply a bomb.  So, it is a good CD overall. 
 Chandace Savage's COWGIRLS will become a classic in Western Literature. In  her three divisions: Real Cowboy Girls, Living Legends, and Rhinestone  Cowgirls, Savage passes through the realities and myths of cowgirldom.   From the brutal work of the lonesome ranches and cattle trails through the  grace of the rodeo arena, and the beauty of the silver screen she shows the  contribution of the cowgirl to the women of the modern west. But it is a  west far greater than even the western ranch community and its celluloid  imitators, it is a west of the soul influencing the strength, courage and  leadership of women today 
 I put off watching this movie for some time.  I've had a hard time accepting the fact that the Charlotte Church so many of us fell in love with, seemingly one of the last remaining bastions of wholesomeness and all-around purity in this world, has caught a virulent case of Britney-itis (and has actually sunk even lower than Britney in a fair number of ways) and is seemingly lost to us forever.  I'm really quite saddened by the whole situation.  Nevertheless, I can still adore the girl Charlotte Church used to be, and, happily, there are traces of that girl immortalized forever in this film.  I was actually quite surprised by I'll Be There; Charlotte's no Jodie Foster, but she's a far better actress than I expected her to be, and this really and truly is a good movie.  It doesn't take us anywhere we've haven't been before, but it's a fun ride.  Charlotte plays Olivia Edmonds, a teenaged girl who finds out that her father is actually famed aging rock star Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson), just after he makes headlines for driving his motorcycle out a second story window of his home.  Olivia's mother never told her the truth about her father because the relationship was short-lived (Kerr never even knew he had a daughter) and she resents the fact that her own still-rocking father was never there for her growing up.  She wants Olivia to join her hairdressing business and stay away from musicians at all costs.  We all know Charlotte has the best singing voice in the whole bloody kingdom, but her mother does not realize just how talented her daughter Olivia really is.  Anyway, Olivia and Kerr slowly develop a relationship with one another, helped immeasurably by Kerr's decision to stop drinking - but dear old Mum wants nothing to do with the man she's obviously still in love with.  Everything comes to a head when Olivia's talent is made manifest, and you can probably fill in the rest yourself.  As I said, I'll Be There doesn't break any new ground, but it's a feel-good movie that succeeds extremely well.  Craig Ferguson makes it all work and injects a lot of comedy into everything he does.  As writer, director, and star, this really is Ferguson's baby and should have enjoyed more success than it achieved.  It even supplies the somewhat disconcerting sight of the Buffyverse's Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) playing a smarmy music agent - earrings and all.  Of course, you also have the added attraction of several Charlotte Church songs (even if they do represent her early foray into pop).  All told, I'll Be There is a surprisingly entertaining, heart-warming motion picture - and those are few and far between these days 
 As a major fan of Snow Patrol, (even before this year, yes) I was very interested in this album because it is the one no one talks about. After purchasing it, I kind of figured out why. It isn't bad... that's certainly not the word for it. Its dreamy soundscape and ethereal vocals are anything but bad. It's just... nothing truly special. To me, a lot of these songs sound the same and if I play the cd in my car (on auto repeat) I never realize when it finishes and starts again. There are a few small gems, "Olive Grove Facing the Sea" and the title track, but when compared to other Snow Patrol greats, they're something I keep in reserve for a rainy day. For anyone well-versed in Snow Patrol, if you're going to compare albums (and you really shouldn't) it would be most like Songs for Polar Bears. Anyway, I wouldn't put it on the top of your wishlist, but if you're looking for some new music and haven't figured out what to get yet... this wouldn't be a bad choice 
 The problem with some of these collections is that many of us who read magazines have already read those articles that appear in these end of year collections. The piece about Marilyn Manson was also in the Jonathan Lethem music collection too. It's good that Eggers has included some stuff for McSweeneys.net, comic books, and other non-mainstream sources. Those are usually the better ones anyway. I like Marc Bolan too

 Funny thing to mention here is that the stated region block (region 1) isn't really present. I took the shot to order this and unlock my DVD player if I had to (I live in Amsterdam, region 2) but I didn't have to!! This DVD is region free! Thanks Amazon, but in future it would be nice to provide correct region-information. I bet that a lot European (and perhaps Australian, Russian and so on) customers cancel their order because of the region code not corresponding with their country region.  Regard 
 People who say this is the last great queen album are "liars" don't believe them kids. The 1991 album Innuendo is one of their best ever. "The game" is also a solid album full of fun pop tunes that are radio friendly. In the states the game had two songs that went to #1, but I always felt this album should have had more top 40 hits. The solid songs "need your lovin tonight" and freddie mercury's "play the game" should have been bigger hits. Another gem is the ballad "save me" which was written by brian may. All in all, a solid Queen album, maybe not on the level of a night at the opera or sheer heart attack but still great 
 I love this book! It's cool. It'll make great gifts. 
  This is really a must have reference for anyone who uses mathematics. Both students and working engineers or mathematicians will find this book useful when need access to tables and formulas.   And this reference is not only valuable for its coverage, but also for how well is the information organized. 
 William T. Vollman is one of the bravest writers in United States still working. He is not afraid of dealing with controversial issues, and he does so not be in the media, but because he has an urge to talk about lives that are forgotten, lives that the average citizen doesn't bother to learn about -- in other words, low lives. His collection of stories "The Rainbow Stories" goes deep into those lives with beauty and delicacy.   Set in various landscapes, like San Francisco, India and ancient Babylon, the book depicts the lives of people that are easily called outlaws, like skinheads, prostitutes, HIV-positive people and so on. What Vollman does with beauty for these creatures is to show that above all they are human beings -- no matter how much we don't agree with their choices. He doesn't take sides, but sympathize with them. The writer illuminates some dark corners of their souls, so that we can understand our very owns.   In his stories that deal with neo-nazis, for instance, Vollman paints a very conscious painting, exposing them as people that live, love, have a job and so on. The same happens in the most beautiful story of this book, called "Ladies and Red Lights", in which the writer tackles the lives of prostitutes, cops and their costumers. Vollman brings himself as a character and narrator in most tales, what gives him a closer approach to this universe.  He did extensively research, living with people who ended up being his characters, a listening to their stories. In the end, this device makes "The Rainbow Stories" some sort of literature verit?. This book certainly isn't for everyone -- some disturbing images and ideas may upset some readers --, but those who are open-minded enough to dive in this colorful world won't regret the trip. 
 Having known of the photo reputation of the late Galen Rowell, we ordered this book and were very pleased to again be reminded of his reputation for excellence 
 We've only had this CrockPot for a few weeks, and used it a handful of times.  It cooks great, but emits a smell of hot plastic when cooking.  There is no visible piece of packaging or wrapping material stuck anywhere and we can't figure out the odor source, but we're hopeful that eventually the smell will go away.  Otherwise, it's A-OK 
 We (Bobby & me) bought this product to use in the weight room at school where there has never been electricity for the past 34 years.  It sounded so great with the new Ipod Nano, that it attracted a crowd.  Great sound coming out of the weight room.   Where is the old crappy boom box?  What do you mean, there's no electricity?  Now we have electricity, which we don't really need.  It sounds so good, that even the grumpy people don't listen to AM radio anymore.  The power did come in handy to charge up the battery.  It just stopped working  one day when the batteries were low.  Boom, no sound....  It would have received 5 stars if the surface didn't scratch so easy.  It loses that new car shine rather quickly.  It seems to enjoy playing "swamp thing" the bestest.  The new Nano didn't fit (great sadness), but Sonic Impact sent a new 2nd generation Nano adapter, which arrived in two days (no sadness, no cost...) 
 Having spent 12 days in St. Petersburg. The information given in this series is very good. The video footage places such as Peterhoff or of one of Caterines Palaces was nice, but they could have done more. Peterhoff is a very large place. But in a historical context the information is good and accurate as far as I can tell 
 Kurt Weill On Stage, a scholarly study published in 2002 by Foster Hirsch, is an outstanding overview of the theatrical career of one of the most talented and ambitious composers writing for the stage in the 20th century.  Hirsch has access to the excellent materials of the Weill-Lenya Research Center and the support of the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music; he supplements the vast array of correspondence and interviews available to him with interviews and accounts of the creation of the works from participants and spectators. He writes compellingly about Weill's gifts as musical dramatist and collaborator. The book is utterly inspiring to anyone (like me) who has ambitions to write for the musical stage. 
 It has always been a pleasure to read anything written by Carol Rushman. She explains well about every aspect and talks with lot of conviction. She doesn't miss out giving examples when needed. She explains right reasoning for an event with proper logic and great accuracy.  In chapter of Stationing and Retrograde Planets she writes "My daughter and I went to have our hair cut on the day Venus went retrograde and we both cried all the way home because we got such bad haircuts. We each had wanted a trim but we both went home with very short hair" She would not miss out making a note of minor or major event in her life.  Examples are very casual and yet not mundane but in line with what she is talking about.  I recommend this book to all who have deep interest in astrology.   Bhavesh N. Pattn 
 1 of the best music DVD's that i have a film about her life, and times,and the music is great patsy and charlie were real people a real film about patsy cline and her life and times "and thats what i love about the south" 
 Joan Grant's book Winged Pharaoh takes us into the possible reality of the First Dynasty and the dream training of a king's daughter who becomes co-ruler of Egypt. As she explains in a memoir (Far Memory), the book came to Joan through "far memory" of a possible past life.  The most fascinating element in Joan Grant's visionary narrative is the description of a dream school that operates within the temple of Anubis. At the age of twelve, Sekeeta becomes a full-time student at the dream school, taking up residence in the temple of Anubis. Every morning she records her dreams and takes the wax tablets to her dream teacher, a priest of Anubis. Some days she must also carry out assignments he gave her inside a dream. Frequently, in her dream travels, she encounters people who have died and are confused about their condition. At this point we come fully alive to the intimate connection between dreaming and dying well, and the reason why Anubis is such an appropriate patron of dream travel. As every school child knows, Anubis is a guardian of the Otherworld, who watches over tombs and mummies and guides souls of the departed to the Hall of Osiris. As psychopomp, or guide of souls, he is also the patron of journeys beyond the body.  As Sekeeta's training in the dream school deepens, she takes on more and more work as a psychomp. One of the most movingly realized scenes in the book is one in which Sekeeta helps a grieving widow to enter the dreamspace and achieve a loving reunion with her deceased husband. This episode is a wonderful glimpse of what compassionate psychopomp work is all about. It seems entirely plausible to me that advanced spirits in ancient Egypt did it this way. I know that gifted dreamers are doing the work in very similar ways today, because many have shared comparable experiences with me during training in our contemporary dream school. As entertainment, Winged Pharaoh is wonderful fun. But when you read it as an active dreamer, you'll find that it suggests a whole curriculum of study and practice.   
 This is a wonderful book, great for cooking from, great for reading through at random. Not just recipes for food that looks like it will taste super, it's also full of interesting and useful information about ingredients, cooking techniques, and so on.  Lots of books claim "No cook should be without this!" This book is right up on the necessary scale with the old Joy of Cooking 
 This is an amazing book. Even if you don't believe in Astrology you have to at the least read the two pages it has about your birthday... and you will become a believer.  After reading the pages about my birthdate, I decided to either read to friends or lend them the book so they can read it on their own. I also kept track of everyone's evaluation of how close their profile accurately described who they are (or who they thought they were)... So far, 22 people have commented. Of the 22, One thought it was off by 50%; one thought it was 65% to 70% accurate; three thought it was 70% to 75% accurate; five thought it was 75% to 80% accurate; seven thought it was 80% to 85% accurate; four thought it was 85% to 90% accurate; one thought it described her to a tee (lets call that 90% to 95% instead of a 95% to 100%)....  Except for the last woman whom I read to. She kept interupting me during... and she became very defensive & argumentative after. Trying justify what she does and why... This is despite the fact that I told her I didn't think her profile was that bad at all. Needless to say, and although we were supposed to go out on a date (we met through mutual friends) she has stopped returning my phone calls or emails since the night I read to her. If you ask me, the book and my survey, had just received single 95% to 100% rating of accuracy that it was lacking... Carla didn't have to say a word to submit her rating... Her reaction said it all.  At the least, this is one of the greatest conversational pieces I have ever come across. The single most qualified book to ever make it to my coffee table. Enjoy.. 
 This book was easy to read and very helpful in communication skills 
 I've been shopping on Amazon for years and this is the first review I've ever left for a purchase I made; that's how impressed I was with this book.  I also collect versions of the classic story and I agree with the other reviewer that this is positively one of the best, ever.  A majority of the pages have beautiful illustrations that wrap into the text or take the entire page, the binding and cover is understated yet perfect for this book.  This is the unabridged version, the original text of the author.  If you were to own just one copy of A Christmas Carol, this would be it 
 I first read Barrie's tale of the boy who refuses to grow up when I was 16 (after watching Disney's movie), and I absolutely loved it. It is in every way better than any film ever made which it inspired (although Disney's version is fun to watch and the recent 2003 version is very good and most faithful to the story).    This review, however, is only to comment upon the illustrations. There are various illustrated Peter Pans; but this one is the very best. Trina Hyman's delicate, gorgeous drawings capture the characters to perfection. Peter is particularly good, looking suitably wild and beautiful, and Tinker Bell is a lovely fairy. In so many other illustrated books the characters are either over-dressed or simply grotesque, but Hyman's version of the characters are simply perfect (MUCH better than the Disney version of them!)    If you buy any illustrated Peter Pan, but this one 
 It's "girly" enough but it's on the spicy side. I love it. It lasts so long but doesn't stay in your clothes. I always get comments and men seem to love it, it's very uplifting..... 
 Didion just nails it: a fast, exhilirating yet non-trashy read about the trashy world that is Los Angeles (models, actors, badly aging people, everyone here is from somewhere else).  I read this book three years ago.  But its images of people driving around on the ten lane freeways here continues to haunt me.  Still amazingly current and relevant today - means it's a true classic.  Not everyone can write both prose and fiction equally well.  Didion can 
 I grew up with this book and album.  I still know many of the songs and stories by heart.  The lessons in this book helped give me a confidence and attitude that my mom couldn't give me, being raised in the 50's with strict gender roles.    As for the reviewer who says this book robbed her of being dinstinctly feminine, I suspect there are other issues at play there.  This book does not promote androgeny, but individuality and discourages typecasting based on gender.  I am still distinctly feminine, I wear dresses and makeup and heels.  But I don't think that because I enjoy looking like a woman, I should be treated as a lesser class.  This book helped me to understand the difference 
 I disagree with the above review written by Mo Ramchandani and strangely enough, I took a look at 2 Days and noticed that the film was produced by an individual with the same name.  Either this is an amazing coincidence or this person has some sort of axe to grind with the film that apparently he himself is at least partially responsible for.  Either way, it's a good film.  It's a shame there isn't some sort of vetting process to prevent strange characters like this Mo Ramchandani from using this forum to file his own petty grievances. 
 Well, I must tell you, I totally adore this knife! It is my best friend in the kitchen and I use it pretty much for every kind of food except bread cutting. I could not afford to buy the whole set and decided that if I could have one knife that cuts just about everything I would be a happy gal. I am totally satisfied with this knife and recommend it highly 
 I first read this book three years ago and it still stands as one of the best books I have ever read on real estate investing. If you have read any amount of REI books you know that this area of publishing it is flooded with 'motivational' books that are full of fluff and short on details (Rich Dad series comes to mind). Suzanne P. Thomas's book delivers the real info that you are looking for. She offers pro insights on cashflow, down payment, selecting a property, different loans to consider, marketing, finding the best tenants, day-to-day details, etc. The focus is on single family rentals, but the info can be applied to most real estate investing situations. If you are a beginner investor this is the book you want to start with. 
 This really works, and you feel good and not hungry while following the diet and the suggestions.  This is not a temporary diet, but a change in life style.  It is the antithesis  of the current low fat, high carb diet that most Americans are told to eat.  My bad cholesterol  went down significantly after being on this diet for three months 
 This book is great for encouraging students to ask questions and infer meaning!  Try it out in the classroom 
 Just finished Miss Loneleyhearts, a wonderful 1930s parable of the American Dream gone wrong. Written in 1933 during the Great Depression, it is a gritty look at the hopelessness of the average person looking for meaning in a materialistic world. Although West is the son of Jewish immigrants, he writes convincingly of the Christian answer to hopelessness, faith in God. Wonderful characters portrayed in a Noir-ish style reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler deal with the big question of the Meaning of Life yet find no easy answers.  The Day of the Locust is much more fully realized than Miss Lonelyhearts. If Miss Lonelyhearts is a parable, The Day of the Locust is a novel. Characters and plot are more developed and West spends more time developing the setting, which is a bleak mid-century Hollywood.  Tod Hackett is a Yale graduate who has been hired to work for a Hollywood studio as a set and costume designer. He falls in love with Faye Greener, a woman who seems incapable of love, but knows how to use her beauty. Sadly, she lacks the talent to achieve her goal as an actress. Tod is just one of the men drawn to Faye's charm. There is a fast-talking midget, a slow talking cowboy, a Mexican who raises fighting roosters, and a lonely retired motel clerk. The novel is more about the dark side of the Hollywood of dreams. West uses his characters to paint a bleak and lonely view of a city of lost angels driven by hope 
 J. Paul Getty lays a clear map for guiding yourself to richness. Early on, Getty asserts that being "rich" is not a number, but truly a state of mind.  In his view, there is no magic potion, mantra or affirmation that will garner you more goodies. If you want money, get out and work for it. If you want to be rich you must work for yourself. And once you hire people, even though you bear all responsibility for what happens, encourage your competent employees to think and act as if they are running their own company.   Getty got rich because he understood the fundamentals of economics, thanks to his parents. Getty reasoned that the whole point of economic growth is to enhance your own life, as well as the lives of those around you.  Wealth and wealth seeking is made to seem loathsome in some altruistic circles. Yet, within the pages of "How To Be Rich", you find a man who consistently laid his ego aside and sweated alongside oil-workers. As his standard of living rose, so did that standard of living of numerous other people around him.  It may appear as if Getty encourages trickle-down economics. Getty worked fast and hard so as to turn any trickle into a gushing spring. If things didn't go his way, Getty maintained a "calm", and thus more productive demeanor, and found solutions. He admits to his screw-ups and delineates characteristics that promote success. In short, Getty delivers a worthwhile read for any aspiring person.  
 Lay Catholics are expected to live out their primary calling in the secular world, while simultaneously being faithful to Catholic teaching and participating in the inner life of their faith communities. This set of priorities has to be balanced, and a lot of ink has been spent on this "theology of the laity." Wolfteich offers a fascinating new approach to the issues, by examining how some Catholic public figures have balanced the private and public selves--notably, John F. Kennedy, Mario Cuomo and Cesar Chavez. Wolfteich concludes that the easy division between a private religious self and a pluralistic public self, made famous by Kennedy, is not theologically satisfactory. Chavez is a better example of someone who successfully blended social commitments and religious faith. Wolfteich also offers a lot of food for thought on more narrowly theological questions about the place of the laity in the Catholic church today. Her book shows once again the value of "hybrid" scholarship, as opposed to the narrowly enclosed vision that often afflicts both Catholic and Protestant theology. Theology, ethics, and social and political thought are beautifully blended here 
 	This volume stands out as one of, if not the, best book in English on film noir, a movement previously largely defined mostly through stylistic analysis and psychoanalytic interpretation.  It  differs from traditional approaches, offering background which the other books fail to include.  By relying on historical sources and context, Biesen indicates noir's rise with the social and most particularly production circumstances brought about by World War II.  None of this has been treated before, in any detail, and many of her points are original (such as the impact of realism on film noir).  Demonstrating how actual wartime life and daily constraints led to the genre will be one of the ways this book will be important for historians of all types for this era and its culture.  The book is simultaneously accessible yet sophisticated, vital and engaging, and is written to attract the widest possible audience.     	The primary research mines lodes of information too often overlooked in film studies, demonstrating the manner in which such sources as censorship and studio publicity may enhance a critical and theoretical examination.  Biesen demonstrates a familiarity with the films and supporting documentation which are the source of the book's assertions.  Unlike so many studies marked by excessive theoretical speculation and cursory historical research, this book combines a wide range of examples with a determination to remain rooted in the evidence they offer. 	Biesen merges close interpretation of individual films, production history, censorship records, publicity, critical response, audience reception, the star system, industry history, and genre analysis.  Most studies use only two or three of these possibilities, and the author is to be commended for the depth and breadth of research.  	Endemic of this exhaustive research is the usage of reviews beyond Variety and the New York Times, the indexed, reprinted journals which are as far as most studies go--although neither offer representative reviews.  Few scholars have mined such treasures as the film pressbooks, especially with such fruitful results.   	So too, Biesen's arguments have been carefully thought through; for instance, I was pleased to see the connections between noir and the espionage genre made, similar genres whose relation is too often overlooked.  The role of female executives in producing noir was surprising.  The linkage between realism and noir was a brilliant insight, and a case convincingly made by the author, one which will profoundly change conceptions of the genre.  The relevance of HUAC in ending noir was also enlightening. 	I was relieved to see, too, that the author knows to interpret documents, not simply taking them at face value.  For instance, noting when filmmakers blithely disregarded censorship instructions will change conceptions of the role of censors. 	I strongly and without reservation recommend this book 
 This is a superb and easy-to-use handbook, which provides subject access to bibliographies, indexes, and professional reference materials. This is a valuable guide for anyone developing children's and young adult literature  collections.  As a graduate student, I often use this excellent reference  guide for research. I highly recommend this professional resource 
 This C.D is quite the surprise coming from Moby! Used to his weird but funky tunes on c.d's like 18 and Play? This Album definitly is quite different from the other. Its more hardcore, it's more jamming and it's more rumble in the bronx. two thumbs up my man, prop 
 This has to be his best CD. Not to long, not too short, unbelieveably funny! The comedian is live, uncensored, at his raunchy best. We miss you, Sam. RIP 
 Deaver really makes the reader stay interested in "The Devil's Teardrop".  I found it arduous to put down.  The serial killer, "The Digger" knew how to remain unseen.  Leaving only a note for the FBI, their only clue, they call upon the help of Parker Kincaid 
 I bought this computer for my just turned 5 year old.  While he thinks it is really cool, it is a bit hard for him.  Of the 26 games, he can play 6.  I am happy that it is a toy he can grow with and it can teach him a lot.  The graphics are great but I do wish the volume could be turned down one more setting.  I do wish there was a setting that they could just type letters to learn the keypad.  All in all, a good investment.  
 You won't be disappointed.  While Mark S Townend was incorrect, John Williams did not do Band of Brothers, Michael Kamen did 
 The book is fabulous, and it was delivered very promptly. Couldn't ask for more 
 I've read at least 20 books from the black lace series and this was by far my favorite. It has a bit of everything from romantic courtship to submission. The book was a lesson in culture as well as eroticism!  Excellent 
 This book was my follow up read to "If Grace is True," and I couldn't have chosen a better read.  While I enjoyed "If Grace Is True," by page 124 I was searching for something else.  My review is under the name "llewdis" and it expresses my views very well.[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0062517058/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/104-7881007-0259964?%5Fencoding=UTF8&customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&n=507846]   This book on the other hand has been as exercise in logic.  I hate to admit that I was a philosophy major. Many Christians seem to dismiss this pursuit as frivilous or unecessary, but this book enabled me to center myself once again.  It is balanced, and well written.  I would encourage all people of the Christian faith to read this book.  It is a teatise that shoud be read by all those who are interested in this debate.  Secondly, this book reenforced a core belief of mine that was fostered by an author Wendell Barry.  I also enjoyed and was persuaded by a book by the author of "Better Off" that espouse a vision of the world centered around personal interaction and intimate community that I feel is  so lacking in the world around me.   I would recommend this book to anyone who has struggled with this topic, even though we may ultimately disagree.  I have no interest in persuading you the reader (that is the authors job!), I would simply encourage you to seek!  llewdis 
 This one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even Booth has a heart...well, more so than we already know.  The ending got me, I got misty over it.  Enjoy with someone you love 
 Nearing the age of seventy, when "the mind wakes to find itself looking blankly into the void of death," Adams wrote for his closest friends his version of the earth-shattering events they had experienced. He had 100 copies printed in luxurious editions and, in early 1907, sent them to such dignitaries as Theodore Roosevelt, William and Henry James, Charles Gaskell, and Henry Cabot Lodge. This private account was not released commercially until after Adams's death, in 1918, when it became a best-seller and won the Pulitzer Prize.  Many scholars and critics, as well as Adams himself, view "The Education of Henry Adams" as a sequel to his earlier book, "Mont Sant Michel and Chartres" (also privately printed). Indeed, the posthumous edition of the later work opens with an Editor's Preface (signed by Lodge, but presumptuously written by Adams himself) in which the author proposes subtitles for each volume: respectively, "A Study of Twentieth-Century Multiplicity" and "A Study of Thirteenth-Century Unity." While the two works are certainly linked thematically, they are not companion works in the traditional sense: "Mont Sant Michel" is a personal examination of medieval institutional and cultural history, while the "Education" is Adams's reckoning of his own involvement in international diplomatic affairs and intellectual circles. In other words, one can safely and profitably read one book without reading the other.  So what is this difficult-to-categorize book about? Reduced to its simplest level, it recounts how an "eighteenth-century American boy" grew up during the nineteenth century, only to be intimidated and awed by the chaos of the twentieth. The unity of earlier ages, when everything revolved around God and Church, had been exploded into limitless possibilities by the discoveries of science and the advent of democracy, and Adams realized that "the child born in 1900 would then be born into a new world which would be not a unity but a multiple."  This somewhat obvious yet essential theme aside, the joy of this book for many readers is Adams's sardonic wit and his penchant for aphorisms; the number of quotable quotes is both delightful and exhausting. A notorious name-dropper, he knows everyone, and offers an insider's account of the most important events of the nineteenth century, volunteering his views on international diplomacy, monetary policy, evolutionary biology, and other matters.   Adams portrays the journey of his life as an ongoing attempt at educating himself, yet he disdainfully learned that formal education was useless and that his dabbling had brought him to a dead end. "Religion, politics, statistics, travel had thus far led to nothing.... Accidental education could go no further, for one's mind was already littered and stuffed beyond hope with the millions of chance images stored away without order in the memory. One might as well try to educate a gravel-pit."  Of course, Adams's self-effacing protests of ignorance are often little more than a pose. His sense of innate blueblood superiority can be grating--a stance exaggerated by his writing about himself in the third person. He repeatedly (and backhandedly) reminds the reader how, as stupid as he might be, he is in good company: "Adams knew only that he would have felt himself on a more equal footing with them had he been less ignorant." "Lincoln, Seward, Sumner, and the rest, could give no help to the young man seeking education; they knew less than he." "Ridiculous as he knew himself about to be in his new role, he was less ridiculous than his betters." One of the most unintentionally satisfying sections of this book, then, is when Adams finds himself among true aristocrats in England--and they dismiss him as a social inferior.  As even Adams's biographer Ernest Samuels and Adams specialist John Carlos Rowe both acknowledge, the "Education" is an extraordinarily challenging work. Writing for his friends, Adams assumed a familiarity with arcane historical details about such affairs as American-Confederate-British diplomatic machinations during the Civil War, the Gold Scandal of 1869, and John Hay's role in developing China's Open Door Policy. Even the annotations provided by standard commercial editions may not be enough for many readers to flesh out what Adams is talking about.   If there ever was a book that requires a study aid, this is it. Assuming you can overcome the common predisposition against such guides, you will discover that CliffNotes provides, in a useful narrative form, the necessary historical and biographical background--although it is certainly no substitute for the wit and wisdom of the work itself. And, for those who finish reading the book and want to fill in the gaps, the more scholarly "New Essays on The Education of Henry Adams" (edited by Rowe) offers additional valuable insights with a minimum of jargon. 
 Excelente libro, la verdad no entiendo a la gente que hace críticas tan duras. Este es un libro que simplemente expone el método de un trader bastante exito. En realidad yo he probado el método, y como cualquier otro método no es infalible, pero realmente funciona bastante bien. Lo que realmente sucede es que para uno ser un trader exitoso necesita tener visión para ver las oportunidades en un chart. Los libros son solo herramientas. Es uno quien hace negocios.  Este libro precisamente es una grandiosa herramienta la cual es explicada de forma bastante simple para poder ser entendida por traders de todos los niveles. Les aseguro que quien haga el esfuerzo de probar el método de Raghee, antes de criticarlo de forma tan dura, se dárá cuenta de lo valiosa que es esta información. Llevo casi dos años dedicado al mercado FOREX y realmente esta es una de las herramientas más valiosas que he encontrado. Mi consejo es que simplemente no se dejen llevar por la apariencia simplista del libro y exploten todo lo que allí se encuentra 
 Loan officer Tony Evans puts his years of experience to the printed page in Manufactured Home Financing, a straightforward guide to getting the best possible deal in financing one's manufactured home. Individual chapters address the advantages of manufactured housing, how to interact with dealers and salespeople, the ins and outs of financing loans, what to do after the loan closes, important forms and documents to be aware of, and much more. An excellent resource offering insight into a little-known, government-sponsored program meant to help middle-income people achieve the dream of owning a nice home. 
 This is a great update and companion to the classic, The Rise of Anthropological Theory. Harris builds on the arguments he first laid out in the previous work. Harris's cultural materialist critiques of other anthropological research strategies have stood the test of time and only need to be updated to include some of the newer trends that arose in the intervening thirty years.   In the first part of the book Harris clarifies some of the theoretical and epistemological principles underlying cultural materialism. He defines culture, discusses the emics/etics debate, discusses holism and individualism and defends science. The second part stands out as the strongest part of the book. He thoroughly critiques sociobiology and biological reductionism. His critique is scathing and pointed yet wide ranging. An interesting note is how some evolutionary biologists seem to agree with his critiques of those who would, at first glance, seem to be their comrades.  The third part of the book is mostly a short explaination of the heart of cultural materialism that answers some questions left from his previous works. The end of this section is a much too short critique of postmodernism. Seeing as how this is the title one would have hoped Harris would have written more. The fourth part discusses some more "recent" cultural topics. In a chapter inappropriately titled Origins of Capitalism Harris explores an excellent cultural materialist explaination of the rise of feudalism in Europe and Japan which was, as he says, the basis for the rise of capitalism. The last chapter wonderfully explains the collapse of the Soviet Union and Stalinist style communism.  All in all this is an excellent update to some of Dr. Harris's earlier books. As with all Marvin Harris's books it includes a wonderful bibliography and index. It is a shame that he did not live long enough to do a complete rewrite and update of The Rise of Anthropological Theory 
 	Darren Staloff offers a compelling and insightful study on the influence of  Enlightenment thought on Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. Staloff starts with an introduction on the Enlightenment, followed by a lengthy chapter on each of his three subjects in question, with a little more emphasis on Jefferson. Staloff asserts that the influence of the Enlightenment was most evidenced and put into practice in this country during the period of the framing of our government, and especially through the thoughts and actions of these three prominent founders.  	As Staloff mentioned, the Enlightenment was the combination of a diverse set of ideas and beliefs espoused by a host of philosophes, including Newton, Locke, Hume, Voltaire, Rousseau and so many others who helped define this new mode of thinking. They were believers in science and railed against `enthusiasm', defined as political and especially religious zeal. They believed in the importance of education, reason, commerce, and in most cases a more republican form of government. Staloff discusses this much better than I can. In essence, these philosophes and their writings contributed fodder to the three founders he discusses in their attempts to help frame our government and setting forth the direction they wanted the country to take.  	Hamilton was a most accomplished man in life, championing the American cause during its struggle against Great Britain, serving in the continental army as an aid to General Washington, primary author of many of the essays in the Federalist Papers supporting the Constitution, serving as Secretary of Treasury during the Washington Presidency, and symbolizing the primary voice for a stronger central government. Hamilton was never beloved, nor is he today. He had character traits that don't usually win admiration, but the power of his mind and his influence could not and cannot be denied. He was a controversial figure in his time and remains so. But as Staloff confirms, it was Hamilton's vision of America, with its emphasis on a stronger central government and increased wealth and power though industry and commerce that became the eventual reality. Hamilton really understood the essence of realpolitik.  	John Adams was without doubt one of the most dedicated men to the cause of American independence. Adams was a principled man who did not always take popular positions, but he took them because he believed it right, such as defending the British soldiers in the Boston Massacre incident. He worked tirelessly in his diplomatic positions, especially in securing loans from the Dutch. Adams also had a profound belief, as the others did, in the value of education as being the best safeguard to protect liberty. Through the crafting of the Constitution to its eventual implementation, Adams was a renowned constitutional theorist and contributed greatly to the concept of a system of checks and balances.  Adams was not without his own faults. He could be excessively vain and easy to anger. Some criticized him for being monarchial and disdainful of the people. Adams, through his broad knowledge of history, developed a keen awareness of human nature, thus wanting a system of checks and balances in government.  	Staloff's last chapter is dedicated to the political life of a true Renaissance man, Thomas Jefferson. The gifted writer of the Declaration of Independence who, among other things, championed freedom of speech and religion as well as limited government, would also be the source of America's romantic vision. It was Jefferson, according to Staloff, who was the first to establish a vision for his country. In his case,  he believed in the superiority of the independent yeoman farmer and a fiscally responsible as well as restrained federal government. He helped create the party system and ably led his political faction to power.   	Jefferson was seemingly both radical and conservative depending on the issue. He abhorred slavery, yet became defensive when he felt his home state of Virginia and the rest of the South was being assaulted by the political and economic forces of the North. Jefferson saw the dangers of slavery and its threat to the Union, yet he became a forceful advocate for states' rights and did little to hinder the `peculiar institution'. He was more radical in his belief in the value and necessities of periodic revolutions as a means to stop the growth of oppressive and unchecked governments that threatened the liberties of the people. Regardless of what you thought of the man and the society he was part of, his brilliance and contributions, like those of Hamilton and Adams, were profuse and far-reaching.  	Staloff makes a good effort in showing the influence of the Enlightenment on these particular founders and the making of our nation. Its influence was undeniable, but it wasn't the only influence. Many of these men looked to the Greek and Roman models and the developments in the British state. Much has been written recently  on the founders and the early history of our republic and that's an understatement. His portraits of these three distinguished founders are well worth reading, even if there isn't a lot of new information. A solid, well thought out book 
 This book was given to me as a gift. I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it.  This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement.  I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read.  This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club. 
 I've had mine for several years now and I find it very dependable and useful. I initially had some startup problems that I, too, thought might be battery or switch related. However I discovered that a spritz of WD40 into the cutter blades has made this tool very dependable. As with all hair-cutting clippers and shavers, blade lubrication is needed. The other thing people should know is that while the blades cut in a rotary direction, the only way the hairs get into the cutter is through the slots. So this tool cuts on the way IN only, so just putting it in the area and leaving it there will be ineffective...you have to insert and reinsert to get uncut hairs into the slots. Knowing these two things should give you a good experience with this tool. The "pulling" and "tickling" that others report is also minimized by having the blades lubricated so that they cut cleanly rather than jam 
 The Castle of Otranto lacks dynamic characters and is sometimes choppy, but overall, it's a great read.  It's short, to the point, and has all the conventions of a great horror film.  This novel is the first Gothic novel and inspired countless novels and films of that genre.  Pick it up and see where it all began 
 The details have been gone over already in other reviews.  This is a top book for China.  I take it every time I go... left my first copy on some plane, and bought another.  Highly recommende 
 This is a great book for new pickling ideas, and the quantities are reasonable for trying new things out (you dont need bushels and buckets for most of them.  The blueberry preserves and pickles are great, peach chutney is wonderful, and the asparagus is now a family favorite.  The home made catsup is a bit of work, but worth it 
 I quickly devoured it and looked again at my many rocks collected over the years from many beaches.  Affirms my interest.  Makes me want an even more sciency one 
 MUY RECOMENDABLE recopilacion de una banda que demostro que la sencillez, la ingenuidad, la ignorancia y el resentimiento pueden llegar a ser ingredientes y justificativo de la explosiva e incoherente actitud de toda una generacion............  
 It has been some 30 years since I first helped build a 4 car garage and there have been many "working alone" projects, ranging from additions, to decks, to complete home remodels since. I'm completely remodeling a house now... Over those years I figured out many of the tips in the book myself. However, it would have been far more efficient to have had the book 30 years ago. The book somewhat makes up for not having a mentor... i.e., someone to "cause [you] to be taught Informed and Instructed in the Trade, Art and Mystery of a [builder]." (Paraphrased from an 18th century apprenticeship agreement). I'm about to order another copy for my brother.. 
 WOW!! I enjoyed this book.  I found this book to be straight forward, easy to follow-- I guess user friendly. Potty training is hard enough.  I didn't need something complicated and time consuming to read- which I found with other books.  I was able to read this book in segments and initiate plan of action.  Thank you for a book that works!! 
 I have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and I find it to be accurate, but it takes a while for it to give a reading. The first few times I used it, it took over a minute to tell me my pulse. However, the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster. So far, this is true, as within the last 3 days, I have received readings within 10 seconds consistently. Considering the price, it was a good purchase 
 Around a brutal and mysterious murder of a soldier, a young attorney will be sent to investigate this dark and bitter incident. A curious honor code seems to exist hovering the subordinates who will try to cover up all the clues with the only intention to preserve the moral and good costumes.  But slowly the truth will make its glamorous appearance despite the efforts, leading to a trail where the confrontation among these two men: Tom Cruise as the good guy in search of the truth and Jack Nicholson as the obsessed man who, behind all his exhibited intolerance and nasty behavior will not be able to avoid -thanks to an admirable tricky game- to hide what was going on that horrid evening when the rules had to be broken in service of a distorted order, according the famous statement of The leopard `s Giovanni de Lampedusa: "Everything must change in order to remain unalterable"  If Dr. Strangelove was a demolishing advertence, genially narrated  about the miscarried conduct and deplorable evasion of the reality and transfer of guilty over imaginary events to justify his own fluids lacks; or in the case of "Apocalypse now" led us to the darkest corners of the febrile madness of a Colonel and all his command who lost the coordinates of  the real world, "A few good men" recreates once more with admirable efficacy and detailed description, the pernicious and eccentric state of mind of a General, to whom the moral codes are handled according his own convenience, being able to transform and dislocate them according his doubtful points of view, the well known rules of the game.   Powerful script, arresting camera angles and one of the most pyramidal performances of Jack Nicholson ever made of this film not only a cult movie, but a firm candidate among the ten best films of the Decade and obviously the masterpiece of Rob Reiner. 
 It never ends, luckily!!! I will never tire of Anne's wonderful, lively imagination. In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles! Anyways, more happens in this story than a change in appearance: Anne becomes the Avonlea schoolma'am, and loves her students like crazy, especially little Paul Irving, who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher. Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT 
 This classic is a must read.  It reminds us of our US history's darkest moments 
 Widely accepted as belonging to the upper-echelon of 20th century novels, The Heart of the Matter centers around the character of Major Henry Scobie. Scobie is an upstanding British policeman stationed somewhere in Africa (Sierra Leone?). There he resides with his wife Louise, a spoiled, soul-sucking dilettante. She proves to be a great foil for Scobie, who is revealed to be an insufferable milksop. It seems that the reason he is with Louise mostly has to do with his ardent Catholicism (see: masochism) and her uncanny ability to make his life abjectly miserable. Due mostly to his unflinching honesty in a world of corruption, Scobie has been passed over for a promotion that was deservedly his. Through a seemingly providential series of events, Scobie has his millstone of a wife shipped off and subsequently meets a young shipwreck survivor (think Lolita meets Heart of Darkness). For once in his cowardly life, Major Scobie allows himself to actually be happy and, for a brief period, finds solace in the arms of his new concubine. Alas, good things are not meant to last. Partly due to his own self-destructive tendencies and partly due to the machinations of the socially inept 'Wilson'(a sweaty poet/pervert who has designs on Louise), Scobie's world comes crashing down. He becomes indebted to Yusef, the Syrian black marketeer with a heart of gold, his wife suddenly decides to return, and he agonizes over cannabalizing his lord while not in a state of grace (see: transubstantiation). Greene introduces, unintentionally I think, his comic stylings into the latter part of the book. Scobie comes to regret the one honest thing he has done in his life and quickly destroys himself and everyone he holds dear. That is to say, he loses what little dignity he had and the reader can allow his/her self a quiet chuckle as his sorry excuse for a life comes crashing down. Laugh-out-loud funny 
 This is a great John Travolta comedy that was probably inspired by a true story in Pittsburgh Pennsyvania back in 1980,when a local popular television celebrity "Nick Perry" was allegedly involved in a televised lottery fix and had to serve prison time.Anyway,it's an interesting must see movie !!!! 
 I found the audio edition of this book with a sensitive reading by Stephen Mitchell to be an excellent companion for listening while driving. It is hard to believe you can find inspiration in the midst of a traffic jam but with the tape version of this book it is possible 
 This was such a good book.  All three in this trilogy are really good.  They just sweep you away to a place where family means a lot and friends are true.  I loved it  and highly recommend.  This trilogy is one of Nora Roberts best 
 its is convenient and compact and easy to use.  it is a procuect i have used for years without any complaints  
 Karier found a way to tie together the essential historical events and philosophical movements that have influenced American educational systems.  This academic text reads like a novel - Impossible to put down and every  page gripping.  He adeptly describes and integrates minor philosophies and  forgotten events with the major influences shaping the systems of public  and higher education in our country.  This book would be an excellent  choice for foundations courses in educational history and philosophy as  well as any course relating to education's role in American society.  All  chapters hold together well enough to be used as separate supplemental  readings, but once you read a few, you just can't stop!  I consider this  book an absolute MUST READ for any student of education 
 Great background on cocao. But most of all- Incredible recipes!  It's that simple. 
 A comparatively obscure work that came after Exterminator! and before Cities Of The Red Night. Very poetic and beautiful to read, continuing the ideas and characters of The Wild Boys from a different viewpoint: revolution through magic, body transference, lust and violence, and in this case sentimental reminiscence of an idealised boyhood. Although not as explosive as some of his more lauded works, this is nonetheless a treasure that has haunted me like a lost love 
 I bought this item as a gift for someone who had just come back from a cruise where every day he was treated to towel oragami animals. He loved the book 
 This is a very good book to read and reference and covers a lot. Although I don't use Sendmail anymore, I still reference it when I support a server that runs it and it coveres everything a book shoudl cover about a topic. It doesn't get all generalized and go off into basic installs and configures of other software and things just to waste more trees, it does it's job and does it well. It's *the* Sendmail book 
 This book is a great sampling of many wonderful classic children's books.  It allows you to see which ones your kids like and perhaps go out and buy the full-size version of that story.  The only problem is that the pictures are smaller. For example, in Good night Gorilla, there are multiple small pages per book page.  There's no corresponding "surprise" because you can see everything that is going to happen on one page, if that makes any sense.  Otherwise, my children love this book and read it almost every night 
 Cyborg is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The acting is bad even for a Van Damme film, the sets are terribly forced and the plot is simply pointless.  You will gain nothing from watching this movie.  Even the fight scenes aren't nearly as well choreographed as in Bloodsport or Kick-Boxer.  Plus it lacks an old Asian man to show our hero the way to defeat young and muscular Asian men (see Bloodsport, Kick-Boxer and The Quest).  So why did I give it five stars?  The truth about this movie is that no more than one minute into it you are hooked.  It is like a train wreck and you cannot turn away until the full hour and twenty-six minutes have passed.  It isn't even that you are entertained, but more like in a trance.  Part of your mind says, "why am I watching this?  Turn it off" while the other says, "OK that had to be the worst scene in the movie so the next will be better, right?"  Wrong.  The ending (I won't spoil it) is beyond corny and is the capstone on the movie.  It must be mentioned that in this movie, Jean Claude pretends he is Jesus.  Jesus Claude, unlike the other Jesus, found an almost miraculous way off his crucifix.  You simply have to see it to believe it.  Do not spend more than eight dollars on this movie, new 
 In 1777, Britain sent a fleet of 11 ships halfway around the world to an unknown land (only one British expedition had ever explored the location) to set up a convict colony.  This feat is unprecidented in history.   A Commonwealth of Thieves covers the story of this experiment, from Arthur Phillip's appointment as the first goveronor of the colony, to his departure in 1792. Keneally does not have any agenda. He evenly covers the events and the people giving what must be one of the best general acounts of this very interesting subject.  After all, Keneally is a great author. What alse could be expected of him?  As an Australian, I learnt about the founding of Sydney in school, but school being school, it was a very simplified and sensationalised version of events.  This book cleared up a lot of the misconceptions and filled in a lot of the gaps. I highly recomend it 
 The film is based in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. Nothing ever much happens and you could just drop dead of boredom. Then the 'Crites' land and start to eat everything that's not nailed down. Low to the ground, built for speed, darts that immobilise their prey laced over their heads, the tiny predators feast and get BIG. Someones on their tail, a couple of face changing bounty hunter aliens who are sent to kill them off, worlds have been consumed when they have go out of hand before. It comes down to a young boy who enlists their help and leads them to the critters - no one wants to believe him - silly them. This is the film Gremlins would have been if they hadn't made Gizmo look so cute - they bite! Classy film with snazzy monsters 
 Every time I've read this book, I'm continually amazed at how well it's done.  Gemmell has a definite formula (or formulas) from which he rarely strays.  I didn't know this the first time I read the book, but even now it doesn't detract from what may be some of his best work.  At no point does Gemmell falter in his plain-spoken, yet insightful writing style.  He delivers a world both with a complex and detailed history as well as chock full of shades of gray.  I'm inspired to write stories like this.  Waylander is one of my favorite characters of all time.  Complex, detailed, unexpected, and sort of realistic.  He reminds me of Jason Bourne in a fantasy setting.  It seems to me that after a lifetime of assassination, that one becomes both a stellar hunter, but also skilled in many areas required to survive.  Gemmell is a good writer and his Drenai series are generally very good compared to a lot of the stuff out there.  I reread the series once in a while and I'm thankful that he keeps putting out books in this universe.  I recommend this book (and the whole series, in fact) to all who call themselves fantasy fans 
 Ansel Adams was one of the best photographers, and reading this book has been an honor and has really advanced my knowledge of how to use the camera 
 While this is a remake of a classic, it does well, but doesn't really offer anything new to the story. [...]  Ryan shows he can do more than comedy and does it better than other comedic actors trying to cross over to drama.  Having him shirtless in pajamas bottoms doesn't hurt. I admit my libido impelled me to buy the DVD and I was happily surprised it worth a lot more than just Ryan as eye candy. I'd love to see Ryan replace Tom Cruise as an action hero star 
 A good handful of recipes that are simple and yummy.  A super fab book that I find myself constantly mentioning and recommending 
 Patterson organizes this history around the various US Presidents from 1974-2001.  The book primarily considers social and cultural issues in the context of their impact on these Presidents and how these latter developped policies accordingly.  As a result, it is primarily a political history and only tangentially a cultural or social history.  That said, the plumline running through the domestic agenda of all presidencies in this period was the cultural wars between progressives and conservatives.  The former camp were liberals, leftists, minorities, immigrants,women, gays, who emerged more powerful from the 60s revolution etc; in the conservative camp  were fundamentalists, corporate leaders, old-schoolers,  who viewed the 1950s as a Golden Age or felt threatened by the rising tide of feminism and multiculturalism.  This "Tale of Two Countries" is complicated by the Me Generation that emerged in the 1970s:  those people who, on the one hand, had abandoned traditional mores like their precursors in the 60s, yet also abandones the ideals of that period, prefering to pursue  bourgeois, consumeristic lifestyles.  It is also the tale of American foreign policy during the Cold War and the post-Soviet world.  The author does not examine the details of American foreign policy, only at how the influence they had on the political scene in America.  The book does not include a discussion of the Military-Industrial complex and its role in policy making.  In fact, very little mention is given to the role of lobbyists or the mediatization of politics.  We are also given almost no clue about intellectual life in America as such.  Perhaps that is in some ways appropriate.  American politics is rather devoid of intellectual content, being primarily pragmatic and populist.  If those traits have saved Americans from the dogma of many modern "isms", it also makes them more vulnerable to opportunistic jingoism, especially when combined with modern marketing techniques and the media.  In any case, it would be unfair to disparage "Restless Giant" due to its superficial treatment of some subjects or absence of discussion of others.  After all, one can only fit so much into a popular contemporary history of 400 pages.  The author remedies this by including a detailed bibliography, providing the interested reader with sources for further study.  Patterson is to be commended for attempting to be fair, providing several perspectives on a given issue.  Finally, as one who lived through all of the epochs covered in the book, it is entertaining/informative to look at the events of this book which are distant enough to allow some objectivity and near enough as to allow me to discern their direct impact on my life 
 My son first listened to this book on CD while we were staying in a hotel.  To our surprise, we were all hooked after the first CD- even my five year old.  It's a very good story and the narration is fantastic.  I highly recommend this CD set to anyone 
 From an original act of eleven (eleven!) Canadian brothers and sisters, the current core of nine siblings keeps the Leahy family tradition alive in music and song.  Featured is fiery fiddling virtuoso Donnell Leahy, with brothers Doug and Angus also on fiddle and sister Erin keeping pace and setting the tone with delightfully intricate keyboard accompaniments.  Most of the tunes are traditional, but the underpinnings are decidedly modern - jazzy piano with bass, guitar and trap set.  If you decide to get up and start dancing to this lively music, you might not be alone; Agnes Leahy adds to the percussion with her own step dancing, which the group regards as way of making music, not just something to be performed to music.  Cool!  I've always thought of dance that way, too.  There's strength in numbers, and this album proves it.  Leahy's love for their material is obvious, and their enthusiasm--multiplied ninefold--is infectious.  Listen to this album and you'll be grinning from ear to ear.  Truly a fun listening experience!  Leahy has since put out two other albums that I'm aware of: "Lakefield" and "In All Things."  I, for one, can't wait for more! 
 Modern phsyics gives us Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  For the lay reader, the plethora of popularizations out there can be daunting.  But, having read the lion's share of all of them myself, I'd recommend to you only a handful:  QM: Nick Herbert's "Quantum reality" Strings: Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe" Everything: Roger Penrose's "the Road to Reality"  Relativity: This book by Einstein!  Einstein's presentation is so clearly stated and concise.  His presentation of what he's thinking is so simple that you'll find you too can visualize just what he's explaining... at the end of the book, you'll find that it actually makes sense... not only that, it makes perfect sense and you'll understand just why the theory had to come about.  The beauty of relativity (as opposed to QM and Strings) is that it IS accessible to us mere mortals and it IS a sensible and beautiful theory, once you strip away everything else and just think about.  That's what Einstein brilliantly helps you to do here. 
 I had no experience with databases before I read this book. I didn't even understand the basic concepts. This book includes basic definitions, detailed database design, SQL statements, how to use Microsoft Access (creating tables, relationships, queries, forms and reports). If you have little or no experience with databases, you will definitely take advantage of this book. It's very easy to read 
 This book provides all the information you might need to create painted furniture yourself.  I recommend it as concise, interesting with colored pictures and explanations.  Good book for the topic 
 This is a wonderful bra. Yes it does run in a larger size but if you get your fit right its the best bra you could own. I have a very large chest and i have never found as good of support as this bra gives me. I would diffently buy this bra again and again and again 
 I have been a zen student for 17 years and I constantly get new insights into life when I listen to these CD's.(In a German accent) Of course then you have more stuff to drop(hee,hee,hee). I love Tolle's sence of humor most of all. Get all his stuff you can't go wrong. We loan it to all our friends. Start a movement for peace in your sphere of influence 
 This book does an excellent job of providing step-by-step instructions.  For a set of instructions, there is a sketch that shows what that sheet of fabric is supposed to look like.  Even though I don't sew, I am much more confident that I can imitate these instructions than books that give only text instructions along with a big picture of the finished product.  I like this much better than the ones intended to be inspiration that include only visuals of the finished products.  Another good book to consider is Do-It-Yourself Fabric Decor.  This book uses photographs to show the steps and also includes sections pillows and slipcovers.  Both books are excellent 
 Tom Scott is a versatile musician who played with dozens of bands and soloists but was rarely a headliner.  His talent, however, is evident in this jazz fusion CD from the 80's. Lots of keen riffs, instruments that really sing, and just plain fun. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! 
 This novel was teriffic. David Gemmell could stand a chance to win fantasy's best writer award!  Keeping in his tradition of heroic charicters and dark deeds this book kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  His ability to take a charicter, that under any other circumstances would be a villan and make him into the last hope hero is amazing.  If you are tired of knowing exactly what to expect in a fantasy book read this and feel refreshed 
 Action, dragons, all the things I enjoy plus a well done story. A good read for any fantasy reader.   If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it 
 I bought this camera last summer. I have taken enough pictures to put up a review now. I LOVE THIS CAMERA! Pure and simple, it has met and exceeded my expectations. The pictures it takes are very nice, sharp, focused, and crisp. It has so many features that you can play around with. I have probably only used half of them more than once. It has a very nice LCD display, or you can take pictures through the traditional peep hole. On the view screen it will always tell you, which mode you are in, gives you a nice centering square, and what picture you are on, etc. The zoom on it is awesome, although I haven't used that much to date. You can take close up shots of flowers, insects, etc., and it still get everything just right. Three of my favorite features though are: the option to take video clips, and the fact that you can shoot photographs in black and white or sepia color, which gives your pictures a real antique or historical feel depending on what you are going for. It will even let play around with shooting night picturs, or different landscapes near and far. When you print out the pictures off your computer, if you have any kind of decent printer you will be almost shocked how detailed and crisp the picture is. I would almost swear that it is better than film pictures. I couldn't stop looking at it, because I was so amazed! For a person like me that mainly takes normal snapshots most of the time, I don't know what else I could ask for in a camera! Moreover, you can't go wrong on the price. Is it a little more expensive than other cameras? Sure! However, for the features it has it is well worth it. It isn't exorbinent to begin with. By the way, for you people that like to shop around for the best price like me, I went to 3-4 different stores in my area that had cameras like this one, and the best price I found was here at Amazon. If you buy it, you will love it, end of story. 
 This is my favorite book ever.  I first encountered Rifles for Watie when my fifth grade teacher read it aloud to our class.  I read the book again several times while growing up.  As an adult I read the book every 5 years or so.  At the age of 40 it's still magic to me.  Please share the Civil War adventures of Jefferson Davis Bussey with your children 
 Heard the CD version of THE 11TH ELEMENT--written and read by Bob Scheinfeld.  Scheinfeld, whose grandfather used this principle to build Manpower from a simple idea into a Fortune 500 company, shows you how to tap into getting help whenever and wherever you need it . . . the key is to know where and how to access it.  Doing so will enable you to become successful, not only from a financial standpoint . . . but also with respect to making right decisions, securing cooperation from colleagues and employees, and achieving more in life with less stress.  Though the concept sounds abstract, it becomes clearer when you listen to the informative CDs . . . Scheinfeld used it to create millions of dollars for himself, then for select clients and proteges across multiple industries . . . in addition, he showed how it has been used to create such international successful stories as Nike, Starbucks and Virgin Atlantic.  There were many useful ideas I gained from listening to THE 11TH ELEMENT; among them:  * Avoid the suntan or sunburn effect. That happens when you get all pumped up, but then you go back to your office and there's no long term effect.  * You can get help on the Internet if you ask the right question.  * Always ask for help for everything you want. Otherwise, nothing will move in your world.  * Be specific in your requests.   * To cut through the noise, every time you need help, tap between your eyebrows three times.  * Watch THE TRUMAN SHOW [the movie) to see a version of how this principle works. 
        In this path breaking contribution to the logic of probability,Keynes showed how to adapt the work of George Boole for the purpose of estimating probabilities.Keynes is the first scholar in history to explicitly emphasize the importance of interval estimates in decision making.For Keynes there are only two types of probability estimates,point estimates and interval estimates.Unfortunately,Keynes decided to call interval estimates " non-numerical "probabilities.His reasoning is really quite obvious.A precise estimate of probability used a single numeral for the point estimate.Therefore,an imprecise estimate of probability used two numerals to denote an interval(set).Thus, an interval estimate is not based on a single numeral but two. These types of probabilities are thus " non-numerical "because you are not using a single numeral.In 1922 and 1926,Frank Ramsey reviewed Keynes's book based on his reading of chapters 1-4 plus 3 pages from Part II and 4 pages from Part V.Keynes's discussion of non-numerical probabilities takes place in chapters 5,10,15 and 17.Keynes then applies his new approach to induction and analogy in chapters 20 and 22,using his concept of " finite probability " ,which applies to both precise ,numerical probabilities and imprecise, non-numerical probabilities.All of Keynes's discoveries ,however,were ignored by the ignorant Ramsey.It is unfortunate that the editorial foreword to the 1973 Collected Writings of JMK edition of the TP, written by Richard Braithwaite ,simply repeats all of the errors made by Ramsey in his reviews.Consider Braithwaite's paraphrase of Ramsey's argument that " On Keynes's theory it is something of a mystery why the probability relations should be governed by the probability calculus."(p.xx,1973).The answer is quite simple. First,the " non numerical " interval estimates will not be governed by the probability calculus.Second,numerical probability calculations,such as the blue-green taxi cab problem of Tversky and Kahneman,will only satisfy the probability calculus if the weight of the evidence,w,is equal to 1,where w is defined as an element on the unit interval between 0 and 1 and measures the relative completeness of the available evidence upon which the probability estimates are to be calculated.(To this day(2006)one can regularly read about Keynes's " strange,mysterious,unfathomable,undefined " non-numerical probabilities in literally hundreds of economics and philosophy journal articles  and books that have been written about Keynes's approach to probability since the Ramsey reviews were first published 80 years ago.These reviews are still cited as " overwhelming " evidence that Keynes agreed that Ramsey's critique had  completely demolished the entire structure of his logical approach to probability.Nothing could be further from the truth.Ramsey's reviews were so poor that Keynes and Bertrand Russell attempted to downplay their relevance so as to save Ramsey from being embarrassed in the academic community.)Keynes then showed that interval estimates,because they frequently overlap,would very likely also,in many cases,be nonmeasurable,noncomparable and/or nonrankable if a decision maker used such order preserving operators like " greater than or equal to " or "less than or equal to ".While this is quite obvious to any reader of Part II of the TP,it went completely over Ramsey's head. Keynes's second major advance was to create his "conventional coefficient of weight and risk", c=p/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)] in sections 7 and 8 of chapter 26 . The goal of the decision maker is to Maximize cA,where A is some outcome.This decision rule solves most of the paradoxes and anomalies that plague subjective expected utility theory.A major accomplishment made by Keynes in chapter 26 of the TP was to specify that the weight of the evidence variable,w,was defined on the unit interval [0,1].It would be forty years before Daniel Ellsberg would define his practically identical variable,rho,on the unit interval between 0 and 1 also,where rho measured the degree of confidence in the decision maker's information base.Since these two measures are one to one onto and isomorphic,Keynesian weight(uncertainty in the General Theory) and Ellsbergian ambiguity measure the same thing and are interchangeable.This means that Ellsberg's analysis can be applied when studying the GT and used to buttress Keynes's theory of liquidity preference in the GT.In Part 5 of this book ,Keynes showed how one could use Chebyshev's Inequality as a lower bound to the normal probability distributions overly precise  and inaccurate point estimate . Part 5 of the Treatise also includes Keynes's advocacy of the Lexis Q test for stability of a statistical frequency[law of large numbers].It is this part of the TP that forms the basis,along with chapter 17,of Keynes's exchange with Tinbergen over the logical foundations of econometrics in the Economic Journal in 1939-1940.Keynes pointed out that ,in order to justify his assumption of normality,Tinbergen needed to apply the Lexis Q test.Tinbergen never applied either that test or the Chi- Square test for goodness of fit.This will then bring the reader back to Keynes's chapter 8 of the Treatise ,where he presents his own logical frequency interpretation of probability as a special case of his general logical approach to probability after criticizing Venn's particular version of a frequency approach.       
 The effort to explain Hitler's meteoric and improbable rise in post World War I Germany has spawned something of a cottage industry in academia and other circles.  In many ways, this first in a two-volume biography of the fascist leader is a contribution to that debate.  Biographer Ian Kershaw concedes that "explaining Hitler" isn't easy.  In the preface he uses Churchill's famous assessment of Soviet Russia to describe the Nazi leader: a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  Indeed, the more one reads about Hitler - his humble roots in provincial Austria, his poor academic performance and general lack of higher education, his lack of discipline and poor work habits, his complete lack of organizational acumen, his prissy behavior and eccentric, aloof personality - the more inexplicable his emergence as a national demigod in one of the most advanced cultures in the world becomes.    Many attribute the success of the Nazis solely to the unique social and political circumstances of Weimar Germany: the humiliation of Versailles, the threat of Bolshevism from the East and internally, native and increasingly virulent anti-Semitism, and the economic hardship of reparation payments and then the affects of the Great Depression.  Kershaw cites all of these as contributing factors to the Nazis electoral gains beginning in the early 1930s, but he argues that it was Hitler - and only Hitler - that could have made the Nazi's ultimate political triumph a reality.  In the early 1920s there were nearly 100 small nationalist groups in Germany (known as the Volkisch movement) that preached roughly the same ultra-patriotic, socialist and anti-Semitic themes as the Nazis.  And there were scores of Hitler-like leaders out speaking in beerhalls promoting the cause of German national redemption and the inherent evil of Marxism and Jewry.  But there was only one Hitler.  Only he could pack the largest theaters in Germany with wild-eyed supporters.  Only he could unite the far Right in a concerted effort to topple the Weimar Republic.  Only he could convert a diverse mix of rural schoolteachers, urban professionals and Protestant clergy to his vision of a new Germany in hour-long harangues in massive public addresses that looked and felt more like religious revivals than political speeches.  Hitler benefited from the tumultuous times in which he lived and he certainly needed the patronage and support of others along the way, but Kershaw maintains that his unlikely journey to the apogee of power in Germany was no accident.    Two points stressed by Kershaw struck me as especially interesting and quite surprising.  First, with the notable exceptions of an unusual gift for public speaking, an innate understanding of the power of propaganda and a powerful memory for facts and figures, Hitler was a man remarkably devoid of talent and, as Kershaw tells it, rather lazy and disinterested.  Second, Kershaw also stresses how little Hitler and his Nazi party actually did proactively to secure their complete dominance over the German government, military and economy.  Many of the most far-reaching changes after Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933 were undertaken on the initiative of others, while the main opposition groups just basically closed up shop.  In closing, the idea that a man with Hitler's background, limited natural abilities and radical viewpoints could rise so far, so fast is so improbable (not to mention horrifying) that it almost defies believability.  And when Hitler boldly completed the re-militarization of the Rhineland in 1936 and held a plebiscite on his rule, he received 99% endorsement.  He was probably the most genuinely popular leader in the world at the time.  Incredible. 
 As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse I found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person.  This book will stick with me a long time and I hope even though it is long, readers will give it the chance it deserves. I thought this work by Mr. Iles to be very insightful.

 Mr. Langford certainly deserves praise for his continued excellence in photographic writing. 'Basic Photography' is THE manual for photographers. It is clear, concise and entertaining to read. This book should be in every photographers library 
 I had bought the original videotape of ESPN's "Life and Times of Secretariat," and the original videotape of "Big Red's Last Race," about the 1973 Canadian International.  It is nice to have both documentaries on the same disc.    But best of all, ALL of Secretariat's twenty-one starts are included on the disc. Almost all of them are shown in their entirety (only the very early races aren't totally complete). I am assuming all of the footage from these races came from owner Penny Chenery's private collection.  It was great to watch Big Red's races from his two-year-old season in 1972. I had never seen any of those races before. From the time Red won the Hopeful, turf writers from all over the country were hailing him as the second coming of Man O'War. He of course didn't disappoint. His five losses were interesting to see, and in the cases of the 1973 Whitney and Woodward, see again. It was clear he never should have lost a race.  I was extremely impressed with his first race on grass, the 1973 Man O'War. Jockey Ron Turcotte claimed Secretariat was better on the grass than he was on the dirt, and he had mentioned the horse seemed almost deer-like when he ran on the grass. In this race, Secretariat went up against the top grass horse in the United States, Tentam. Tentam did his best to try and catch Secretariat, who was on the lead most of the way in the race, but he couldn't do it.  Secretariat's best performance was arguably the inaugural Marlboro Invitational. In that race, initially intended as a match race between he and stablemate Riva Ridge, there were ultimately FIVE champions in that race, including Secretariat, Riva Ridge, Kennedy Road, Key to the Mint, and Cougar II. No single race since has had that many champions. Secretariat caught Riva Ridge at the top of the stretch and coasted home in world-record time, a record which stood for many years.  The DVD is expensive, but to see all of those races again it was worth the money 
 I have seen many historical war dramas from Far East (mainly China's) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy.  Yi Soon Shin, however, is a rare exception.  Not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the Chosun political factions (and the second-guessing nature of the king) which causes his eventual death.     Also, the special effects are great.  The battle scenes (whether on sea or land) are realisitic and of outstanding quality.  The only problem that I can find is that the DVD has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the Ming China.  Then again, this is not unexpected since this is a Korean drama focusing on the great admiral.  Also, the entire selection should have 104 episodes.  I don't know why it stops at 101.  If you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject, try Samuel Hawley's Imjin War (which portrays Yi Soon Shin more accurately by quoting original sources).  Any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out Stephen Turnbull's Samurai Invasion (which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the Japanese perspective).    Lastly, anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out Shogun:Total War by Creative Assembly (now in Gold version). 
 i absolutely love this book...quirky cute topics...gives you advice on daily things from money to being a good date or hotess...if you love their e-mails than you'll def want to buy this book...i can def see myself using this book as a reference in the future : 
 I've read four books on the subject and this is the one I found most helpful.  I referred to it constantly and used it as a text book while I was writing my first TV treatment 
 There surely can't be many tragic love stories more affecting and involving than this. Nor, it seems to me, can there be many that are more original, despite the conspicuous play the author makes of depending on ancient sources. The tale of Troilus and Cressida (Criseyde) derives ultimately from the Iliad through a multiplicity of mediaeval variations, cited in detail by the editor. It is original in the way Hamlet is original, in its depiction of characters and thought-processes, and it does not suffer from the comparison. There are four protagonists, and two are straightforward, contrasted with a wince-making clarity. Troilus himself, son of King Priam of Troy, is a mighty warrior but tongue-tied and shy when it comes to dealing with women, derisive to begin with at the agonies of those who fall in love and then falling hopelessly, suddenly and finally into the same trap himself. How often have we all seen just that happen within our own acquaintance? Diomede, sent to escort Cressida from Troy to the Greek camp as part of a prisoner-exchange, is uninhibited in that respect to the point of outright crassness, with an eye for an opportunity and an easy `nothing venture nothing gain' attitude that I would again guess most of us will recognise without much difficulty.   The other two are anything but simple. Chaucer stays deliberately vague regarding Cressida's relationship with Diomede (characteristically hiding behind his sources - he was anything but straightforward himself), and what if anything remains of her love of Troilus. However it seems to me that there was a calculating bit in her decision to give herself to Troilus in the first place. She could make herself fall in love, and her fascinating speeches with the twists and turns of their thinking say to me that she was no innocent, quite unlike her infatuated wooer. That leaves Pandarus, a creation to rival Iago in a different way. Again, it's left to us to decide what prompted such extraordinary vicarious commitment to bringing the pair together. There may or may not be hints that his motivation was not altruistic, but hints are the most they can be. It is not just a matter of his strange motivation but also of his extraordinary mental agility and speed of reaction. He plots the lovers' tryst in fantastic detail, when the fateful prisoner-exchange is decreed he tries to steer Troilus into a different outlook that in effect abandons the romance he has taken such incredible trouble to arrange, and to the very end he is still trying to manipulate the emotions of the devastated Troilus.   It is all told in an easy and relaxed verse, typical Chaucer in being at the same time deadly serious and tongue-in-cheek. This verse is not as 'poetic' as, say, The Ancient Mariner. It stands in much the relationship to that, poetry-wise, as Hamlet does to Macbeth or Othello. This is a psychological drama, not an opportunity to display the special `tone of voice' and `way of saying things' that Housman thought the essence of poetry. Obviously it is in mediaeval English, and this edition uses the authentic original spellings. This will slow most of us down a bit, but that can actually be a good thing. I found that it not only forced me to read with the close attention this drama needs, it kept me fascinated with the wonderful English language itself, and I had to notice how popular speech and even slang have kept alive ancient meanings of words (guess, deal, gear, right, sweetheart) that have been lost in more formal discourse. Where this edition is particularly helpful is in its footnotes reminding us of the meanings of certain words (and reminding us repeatedly, for which I bless the editor) and translating occasional phrases and lines where we might go wrong. I think I only had to refer some half-dozen times to the glossary at the back throughout a poem that is half as long as Paradise Lost.  The editor is no less a person than the Professor of English at Cambridge, so his introduction has the thoroughly thorough and also thoroughly stifling profundity that I associate with university literature courses. There are also notes at the back, very helpful in the main but obsessed with quoting parallels for the sake of quoting parallels. At V/1176 there is the line `Ye, fare wel al the snow of ferne year', and I thought immediately of Villon's `Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?' On turning to the back I found that the editor just quoted this obvious parallel without further comment on what the connection might be, and for a moment I nearly hurled the book across the room. Again I wondered whether the proem to book III might have influenced Milton's great invocation of light at the start of the same book of Paradise Lost, but no light was shed. In general, though, this is a very helpful edition. When reading the Iliad I found that after I had read the first 23 books the 24th was comparatively simple. You may find here that once you have got through the first four books you are quite fluent with the fifth.  
 This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub.  The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately.   In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk 
 The powerful impact of this story sort of sneaks up on you in the cracks between the cartoon panels.  This story both of his parents troubles in Nazi occupied Poland, and ultimately as Holocaust survivors, is blended with the story of his strife with his aging father.  This is simple and powerful.  Story telling stripped to the bare bones 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It helped me gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of the principles embodied in the U.S. constitution, the nature of American politics, and the structure of American government, both state and federal, as well as the relationship between the federal government and the states. It's a must-read for any serious student of American history, government, and politics 
 You could scour shelf after shelf of mysteries and not find Underground Man's equal.  Macdonald's prose is unmatched and his past-engulfed characters stumble through a charred southern California landscape unable to escape their history.  This book will, however, spoil you for other mystery writers who cannot match the master.

 For the mass of the public, this book may seem difficult, at first, but I guarantee the read is well worth it. I am not a scientist, but I love reading about science and about the network between all creatures.  The Global Brain takes the reader from the very first life on earth and how it must have evolved. We are taken all the way through history to our current time.   The writing is serious, but sometimes becomes playful, all the while enlightening us with how all creatures are interconnected.  It is one of the most encouraging and comprehensive books, on this subject,of our time.  Marcielle Brandler, Author/Producer www.webspawner.com/users/marcielle 
 The TekQuest Mosquito Catcher is a sturdy, well built device that actually does what it claims. After setting up the unit according to directions, I allowed it to run on 24 hr mode. (it also has a nightime only mode) I let it run for a few days and checked the collection tray.  Sure enough, the remains of thousands of mosquitos, and a moth or two, had been collected. Once the mosquitos have been captured, the remains begin a decomposing process, so there is very little left of the pests. After letting it run on 24 hr mode for several weeks I switched it to night only mode. Once the sun sets the unit turns on, runs allnight until the sun comes out. So far it has worked flawlessly, and sitting out on our patio has become a welcomed event again. Thank You TekQuest 
 As its name implies, SATURDAY takes place entirely within a 24 hour period in the life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne.  As it is not an action novel, this means many tangents within Perowne's head combined with an introspective approach.  It takes a good novelist to make such a book anything but dull.  Fortunately, Ian McEwan justifies his reputation here.  SATURDAY is extremely readable but, although certainly far from lowbrow, not as thought provoking as some others would have it.  The book takes place against the backdrop of massive protests against the upcoming military excursion into Iraq, on February 15, 2003.  These protests are always in the background and provide some empirical grounding for the unfolding of the day.  McEwan's skill is that he has the reader think about, but as a writer does not himself explicitly focus too much on, how little decisions and details of life may have large consequences down the road.  A subtle example is when Perowne sees a young woman in the square across from his house and, from her actions with her boyfriend, realizes that she is a drug addict.  Perowne reflects that it was probably just a few distinct choices in that woman's life that took her down a path so different from that of Perowne's own daughter, a young woman of about the same age who is coming home that night from Paris and is about to publish her first book of poetry.  A more powerful example is the thug Baxter.  His fate is beyond the scope of choice and is, alas, encoded within his genes.  The fate of free will in the age of neurology is another theme weaving its way through SATURDAY.  Though even with Baxter's fate being neurologically sealed, the issue of decisions comes into play.  Near the end of the day, Perowne reflects upon how he encountered Baxter and recalls that twenty hours ago he drove across a road officially closed and set in train a sequence of events leading to his saving Baxter's life only to unofficially condemn him to a genetically inspired madness.  McEwan obviously did a great deal of research in the field of neurology for this book.  Although that is to be commended, what is less praiseworthy is his focus of the minutia of the field at the expense of readability.  One ten passage near the end is, sorry to say, nothing short of boring.  Good thing the rest of the book is so good and so worth the time 
 One of the primary purposes of fiction is to delve into the thoughts and minds of other people, areas which we don't usually have access to. With a commanding and masterful authority, what Mantel does in this novel is present a character named Alison who is a psychic and can effectively take on the traditional role of the writer: moving in and out of other characters' thoughts, delving into their pasts and oftentimes uncovering things about their lives which the characters themselves aren`t even aware of. Tragically for Alison, her own past is what remains illusive and opaque. Her father is unknown as her mother who used to work as a prostitute can't even be bothered to speculate about his identity. She bears a number of disfiguring, deep scars on her legs, but can't recall what she did to deserve being given them. She's plagued by a spiritual guide who is incredibly crass and low-minded. Although she's a very sensitive and tender individual, she's very strong. She must necessarily develop a slightly self-mocking public persona in order to carry out her work giving psychic readings to a mass audience. Beyond Black charts the painful process Alison must undergo to develop a sense of self worth and a feeling that she is someone who deserves happiness.  Mantel has a magnificent talent for writing about the indignation people feel when trapped within systems which treat them impersonally. She's written about this when describing her experiences in hospital within her insightful memoir Giving up the Ghost. In one scene of Beyond Black, Alison and her business partner Colette buy a new house. The anguish of dealing with an estate agent who assumes they are lesbians and treats them with a perfunctory formality is expertly described. There is also a very funny scene when Alison goes to the doctor. Ironically, because of her psychic ability, she's able to diagnose the doctor's ailments better than he is able to assess her condition. These scenes painfully evoke the dilemmas we face in modern society when caught within a capitalist system which impersonally deals with  customers rather than individuals.   In this richly detailed book, Mantel is more concerned with the intricate psychology of her characters and the muddled, bizarre experiences of psychics rather than with constructing a thrilling plot. There is a complicated mystery at work. But those seeking a more traditional spook story may be disappointed. Mantel doesn't go for cheap horrors by writing about things going bump in the night or illusive shrouded figures spied in the distance. The real horrors she explores are the mundane concerns which clutter our daily lives and the possibility that these trivial obsessions can continue after death. Rather than presenting the after-life as one of two extremes: blissful paradise or tortured damnation, she offers the terrifying possibility that existential anxiety might plague us even after death. Hilariously, Mantel at one point likens this vague longing and unsettling condition to waiting in line at the National Health Service. This is almost an extension of an idea Sartre presented in his play No Exit. If Hell is other people, then in Mantel's world we will be complaining, nagging, annoying and infuriating each other for eternity  - a horrific thought indeed.   
 I found Banker to the Poor to be an excellent, enjoyable read that provided me invaluable insights into poverty in third world countries, and educated me about effective market-driven ways to allieviate poverty, empower the poor and transform poor women from victims to successful entrepreneurs.  Well worth anyone's time to read. The author's award of the Nobel Peace Prize seems very deserving.  
 I've lived in Belgium for over five years.  When I got here I knew no one.  I happened to meet a wonderful Belgian woman with whom I fell in love with and married.  This book was given to us by very good friends on our third anniversary a few months ago.  My wife laughed at this peculiar present from Americans and put it with the rest of our cookbooks.  However, some months ago she was trying to remember a family recipe and was having a difficult time recalling all the stuff that when in it.  So she got the cookbook out, found the recipe, and prepared the food according to the book.  Now, she cooks from this book on a regular basis and I am the benefactor of this.  This was a great present and it truly is a great cookbook.  It is very accurate and reflects the fine Flemish and French cuisine of Belgium.  I highly recommend this book for lovers of good food 
 I recently started an ABA masters program. Learning a new subject can be extremely hard, and being surrounded by peers who know the subject very well can be intimidating. Words or phrases people were using in class were sometimes going right over my head. Although the classes were geared towards learning these phrases and terms, it was becoming very difficult to remember which term meant what! My professor recommended Behaviorspeak. I was saved!! The book was easy to follow, and you were able to look up useful terms, assessments, and even important people within the field. The best part was that the book had humor which made the reading both fun and interesting! I can't wait to try out my new array of vocabulary next semester! A recommended read, and useful guide to help you while continuing throughout the field. 
 Of my 3 favorite books, this is one of them.  Made in Japan is part autobiography, history, economics, Japanese culture and business all rolled in to one.  The writing style is one of the most comprehensible I've ever read.  Very interesting, insightful, and informative.  Akio Morita is a very cool guy, and he's lead an interesting life.  If you like business, economics, or Japanese culture, this book is definitely worth the read 
 This unusual story succeeds on several levels. Plotting is good, with fast action and unexpected plot twists. Characterization is excellent, with 3 dimensional people. The psychological aspects of tensions between fathers and son are woven beautifully into the plot with several variations on the same theme. A very offbeat love story is also part of the plot. The book retains interest even on re-reading 
 Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific 
 I wasn't even shopping for a T-shirt reconstruction book at the bookstore last night.  In fact, I didn't expect to be interested in this book because when I browsed through Generation T before, the projects didn't seem all that compelling to me.  However, with every page-turn, I saw a different project in Tease that I would love to try.  Some of the ideas were completely new to me; some offered ways to execute ideas I've been chewing on for a while; some seemed pretty standard but still helpful in their instructions.  I love the different ideas for lining cuffs and collars, and one of the shirts I hope to do soon is the one with the crocheted bits, not to mention the T-shirt button-down and some of the totes and the Marilyn shirt for some easy, fast gratification.  I bought the book and stayed awake thinking of the projects I would work on the next day if I didn't have to go to work.  I can't wait to begin breathing new life into my old T-shirts and plundering Good Will for more project Ts 
 This puzzle is great, and I'm glad I bought it for my 2 year old, Claire. However, like most toddlers, she prefers things that are HER size. I find that the hands in this puzzle are slim adult sized hands, like my own. Maybe the makers felt "Mommy" sized hands were the way to go, or simply that they wanted to fill the space in a standard sized wooden puzzle. I think it would have been nice to make the hands toddler sized, with chubby palms and fingers. That said, it's a great tool. We don't use it much for counting, though that is it's intent. This is more of a prop for the song fest of "Where is Thumbkin" and an even more exciting prop for the game of "Dr. Claire" wherein she repairs the "owie hand".   All in all, a fine addition to your wooden puzzle collection 
 Miller writes the tragedy of the ordinary citizen of America, the common man. The tragedy of the businessman Keller who is responsible for sending faulty parts to plane manufacturers leads to the death of many pilots. Miller is the master of writing of family relationships, of tensions , ambitions, betrayals. He writes here as in 'Death of a Salesman' of a son who discovers his own father's failings, and who is tragically destroyed by this. There is also as in many other Miller plays the implicit condemnation of the corruption of the 'capitalistic system'.  The dialogue is that apparently simple colloquial which often becomes profound and moving.  This play precedes 'Death of a Salesman' shares many of its themes, is not as powerful as it is. 
 Fu Manchu's new CD is killer, no doubt!  Songs like Lesson, Land of Giants, Let Me Out and Hung Out To Dry are completely kickass!!!  Believe it, I've got all of the Fu's albums and this CD is no letdown whatsoever, its cool the whole way through!!! Get it now and OBEY!! 
 Dear Natalie (and how many reviews begin with that), thank you so much for writing this book.  If it weren't for  your guidance, this resistant writer would still be staring out the window of her Maine summer house wishing she could be published (or that she had anything to say for that matter).  A great classic book that I recommend to all my sisters on the journey....Sincerely, Pamela D. Blair, Author, The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Midlife and Beyon 
 The executioner of Wittgenstein's estate, GH von Wright selected numerous notes that concerned general sort, culture, and religion in this book. He first tried to include only the best remarks, but eventually he decided to include everything. The remarks are arranged in chronological order, not by subject. It has an index, but not so meticulous one.   Majority of subject covers music (8 notes for Beethoven, 5 for Mozart, 9 for Mendelssohn), religion, faith and God. I was struck by his indifference to political affair though. He himself was a homosexual Austrian Jew and his family was at serious risk during Nazis era, yet there is almost no reference to Nazis, Third Reich or Fuhrer (Contrast this to Einstein, Oppenheimer, Heidegger or Russell!).  Although it is generally regarded that the ordinary language philosophy was dead in 60's, it is still worth reading. For instance, on Christianity, he says : "Christianity is not based on a historical truth; rather, it offers us a historical narrative and says: now believe! .....Here you have a narrative, don't take the same attitude to it as you take to other historical narratives! ... There is nothing paradoxical about that!" According to a recent poll, 80% of American believe in the virgin birth of Jesus. Some social critics deplore the degradation of our scientific education, but I am not sure that if that's the right attitude.  
 I originally bought this disc because of one song I wanted "Too Many Times" by the awesome Earl Thomas Conley and Anita Pointer of the Pointer Sisters.  I was surprised that I actually knew 3 other songs on this collection that I haven't heard since I was a teen:  A beautiful and touching "A Place to Fall Apart" by Merle Haggard and Janie Fricke with backup vocals; "Both to Each Other" by Eddie Rabbitt and Juice Newton who sound great together; and "To Me" a beautiful blend by Barbara Mandrell and Lee Greenwood.  Some of the other songs I haven't listened to because they are songs from 'before my time'; but to me, this disc was worth the one song I wanted, but was surprised that I liked 3 others, so all in all, I'm glad I purchased this CD! 
 Brenda's collection is still the most comprehensive collection of diverse design research methods I can find.  I use her book to inspire, intrigue, and sometimes perplex students, exposing them to lots of new ideas.  I use the book in combination with Kuniavsky's more practical how-to information in Observing the User Experience.  He provides too much detail and not enough high concept.  The combination ends up working very well.   If I could choose only a single text, I would choose Brenda's design research  book.  I can fill in specifics about different techniques drawn from many books and web sites, but the creativity of methods and the clear belief in the power of design research conveyed in the book needs to come from real world writers, not just from the professor claiming it is so.  Her book makes the case 
 A classically illustrated Caldecott Honor Book counts to twenty in rhyming short sentences.  The author notes, "There will...always be children who must learn to count.  Teach them also to enjoy the process and  to count those things that are important to them," and she does 
 My Dad was given this book when he was a boy by his Uncle.  My Dad gave it to me when I was 13.  And I'm giving it to my 12-year-old.  This is a perfect book for the inquisitive mind just starting to understand the vast world of science and math.  While it is perfect for a child with a lot of questions, it's a fun book to read at any age.    Does a great job at explaining just what infinity is, and how many "infinities" there are and why.  Concepts of relativity are arguably one of the highlights of the book 
 "Memento" is a masterpiece of suspense. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. Guy Pearce portrays [Leonard Shelby] a former insurance agent who is trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that Leonard has short-term memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked.   Therefore, as a result, the character Leonard Shelby does not have the capability to remember anything within the last 10 minutes. Whenever Leonard has a conversion or reads something, he must write it down, or tape it or he will forget. To do this he resorts to photographing people he meets, and tattooing his body in order for him to remember the most important information which he feels will help him find his wife's killer.   The interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order. Joe Pantoliano portrays the character [Teddy]. And where Teddy's loyalties lie leave the viewer in suspense. The entire movie is a masterpiece in script-writing, and it is thoroughly worth the watch. I highly recommend this movie to all viewers. 
 I really liked this book, although it was a couple years ago. Some parts i remember being a snooze fest, but when it go intresting, I couldn't put the book down! Expecially when she gets kidnapped 
 Norm Tyler's new book is a much needed addition to the literature on Historic Preservation.  Loaded with fresh examples of the myriad preservation activities taking place across the nation, it also details the  context of the movement through analysis of the icons, both human and  idealogical, of historic preservation.  Clear, concise, and very readable,  it will appeal to both the professional and avocationist alike.  The  inclusion of basic economic, social, and architectural impacts in historic  preservation are welcome contributions, and the various charts and lists  are extremely useful. I use it at the graduate level as the companion to  Fitch's classic: "Historic Preservation.&quot 
 very good knife, althrough the Hollow Ground was a big deal. But to me 8 inch chief is too big.   
 If you want a book that will give you the honest to goodness truth, then look no further. This book will give you that and more. Good women who date bad men does not work. If your a good man you will find that this book will influence you to find a good woman who is beautiful from the inside and out with the brains to go with it. This will enable you to build a solid foundation of character, morality and integrity in finding, meeting and dating a beautiful woman.    
 The book is an insightful examination of George Washington's character.  Previous reviewers have been critical of the authors analysis of the sources and seems to regard this as inappropriate.  Not only do they misinterpret Ellis' assessment of Washington but they ignore a fundamental role of historians to interpret and analyze their sources.  If one is interested only in the facts, then consult the sources in the endnotes.  The author's writing is clear and fluid and his judgements reasoned if debateable at times.  On the whole, I highly recommend this book as an examination of George Washington, perhaps our most important founding father 
 Agnes Smedley's working classic, DAUGHTER OF EARTH, is as alive today as it was in the 1930's. Thanks to Feminist Press, which keeps many classics alive for us, this book is a vivid and vital tale of Marie's struggle to survive neglect, abuse, and a tragic loss of self-esteem. Based closely on Smedley's own impoverished youth moving around the South and West of the country, it reveals the chief abuse as the character's own oppression of herself. Smedley is a poet in her prose, touching us with quick and hard earned lines. She has moved from the plodding naturalism of a Dreiser to a lyric and challenging portrait of a life. It's real tragedy lies in its revealing a pattern of abuse that continues today. Read it for its insight and humanity.  -Larry Smi 
 The author deals in an original way with the difficult nexus between statistics and stories, between alpha- and betascience, without favouring one of them, and indeed arguing that both are complementary. This striking impartiality creates the space for original ideas about everyday-situations that every reader will certainly recognize. To be original about (seeming) banality, that is the work of a true great mind. The reason why I do not rate this book with the maximum score, is that it sometimes misses an overarching line of reasoning. The discursive path may strike some readers (like me) as too associative. Needless to say that such a style has its charms, but perhaps due to my Europe-continental education, I am a bit more at ease with a clear thesis and a transparant construction. Nevertheless: it is absolutely imperative to buy this book 
 Terry Pratchett does not write bad books.  They are clever, punny, and funny.  I laugh out loud every few pages.  Read Terry 
 "Brigid's Cloak" retells an ancient tale about the beloved Saint Brigid of Ireland (453-524).  The day she was born Brigid was given a brilliant blue cloak by a mysterious Druid, who was told in a dream to bring the fit to the child born on the night of the singing stars.  Ten years later young Bridig is taking care of a small flock of sheep belonging to Prince Duffy, the blue cloak now tattered but her most treasured possession.  One evening, after doing her chores, Brigid says a prayer of thanks as she always did.  But when she leaves the stable to go in for supper she finds herself in a strange land, where the air is dry and warm and the men are dressed in oddly colored robes.  Eventually, Brigid discovers that one of the things she had always liked to imagine is about to come true.  What is remembered about Saint Brigid today in Ireland is not only her cloak but also her generosity, both of which play pivotal parts in this ancient Irish story.  American writer Bryce Milligan and English artist Helen Cann tell the story of faith simply with appropriate mixed media illustrations (with Celtic designs used as the lower borders).   For any young Irish lass, even if she does not have red hair and freckles, let along a blue cloak, this would be an ideal St. Patrick's Day gift 
 For me, the best part of MBA's Strategic Management course was getting to know the ground breaking works of Michael Porter. I found the book 'Competitive Advantage' so impressive that I also ended up ordering 'Competitive Strategy'.  Competitive strategy is even used by wallstreet investors and analysts to develop investment insights.  The classic paper 'What is Strategy' still has me thinking and mulling over -definitely an uncontested winner as my year 2006's best read! 
 People looking for Top Gun, Commando or Rambo II would be advised to stick to 80's action flicks.  There is very little action in this movie.  Hard to believe, but they used to make movies with acting and dialogue and plots and morals to the story.  Even many Westerns, Crime Dramas and War Films had discerable plots and themes and allowed for character developement. Toko-Ri was the 1st film to view the Korean War in unflattering light. Holden based his character on his brother, who had died in the war, so this was a very personal project for him.  The dialogue is a bit hackneyed but the emotions are very believable.  Worth a look see if only because there are very few Korean War movies 
 If you haven't heard of this album, you must not be a true g funk fan. It doesn't get much better than this. 1995 was probably the best year for rap, both east and west coast. And this 15-track album, Dogg Food, is one of the reasons why. The album sports 3 g funk classics. The first is the immortal "Let's Play House," which cannot be boasted about enough. It's still amazing, 11 years removed, and still sounds fresh. Blows anything today out of the water. Easily. The idea of using "London Bridge" as the sample must have been met with much laughter. Gangsta rap and a nursery rhyme?? And yet, they make it funky. This song is so versatile, perfect both for parties (dancing), or just cruisin' in the car. While "Let's Play House" boarders almost on pop, with very light lyrics ",Respect" boarders on hard gangsta rap. It's still very much g funk, but as the intro to the song explains: "call it [g funk] what you want, just don't forget the g." So while the attitude in "Let's Play House" is "keep it funky," the attitude in "Respect" is "keep it gangsta." Anyway, it's a classic, with a deep powerful baseline and hard lyrics. It's amazing how both ends of the spectrum are covered. And that Daz and  Kurupt pull it off is even more impressive. Finally, "I Don't Like to Dream About Gettin Paid," is the third classic. Nate gets his croon on in this one that is second only to "Regulate." In both songs Nate is the backbone and what makes them so special.   Other memorable songs are "Doggz Day Afternoon," "Smooth," and "Big Pimpin" (which is way too short). I don't know what the big deal is about "New York, New York." The beat is weak and it departs from that pure g funk sound. The rest of the album pretty much goes like this as well, with less memorable beats. But hey, 3 classics and 3 near classics. Very few albums can boast this. Go out and buy it, before I start going on about "Let's Play House" again.... 
 I have loved this movie since I was little finally found it on the internet and bought it for my brother. The only movie with Ben Stiller that I like 
 Overall excellent.  Deviates in some areas from traditional orchestral renditions -- leaves out a few minor portions and adds in others.  Some sections very difficult (e.g. apparently carry-overs from 4-hand/2 piano version).  But a great work nonetheless 
 Peter Schweizer is getting into the game early, one of several biographers compiling the history of one of the greatest heroes of the 20th century, while the memories are still fresh.  To those who knew better, the Soviet Union was doomed to collapse, but it was only a matter of time as to when, and how many millions would suffer in the process as its iron fist rusted away. At a time when America seemed to decline, a timely election put a vibrant, critical force in power to hasten the Soviet demise. Reagan was no great genius, but provided the much needed energy to revitalize what was truly great: the American spirit, and to embolded brave leaders in other parts of the world, most especially Lech Walesa and Pope John Paul II (a future saint, surely to be remembered as John Paul the Great.)  Of course, Reagan wasn't perfect, and the book glosses over or ignores some of his major failures and faults, like the deficit spending, the lack of guidance for a post-Soviet Afghanistan, Iran-Contra, and Sandra Day O'Connor. 
 I would just like to say Troop brings back alot of memories for me I was in High School having the time of my life there was fun in listening to music no crazy violence how it is now. And I can't stand to hear it how the new artist or disrespecting each other especially the young ladies yes I understand you want to express your life but come on now clean up the videos and lyrics, please Troop make a comeback we need your music to insprire the teens of Today. Thanks and please continue to Play the old skool Music, as long As I'm around You will always have a listener 
 This is a pioneering book, which provides a generalist approach to dealing with cross-cultural issues with many excellent examples. Hofstede was one of the first to bring the study of how culture affects human interaction in the field of business. The quantifying approach is very similar that cultural anthropologists use.  As with all pioneering works there is some criticism about conflict resolution as other reviewers have pointed out. Another central criticisms of this model has been that nation state and culture are always presumed to be the same. Local culture does not follow political boundaries.  Some readers might be tempted to think of people in simple categories, which is precisely what Hofstede counsels that we should attempt to avoid. Cultures and organizations gives good insights on how "Groupthink" controls our lives and how we could improve interaction. This is a good book for international managers and students of culture 
 I found this product to be very unique, and helpful, in that I could quickly remove & retain the glasses around my neck.  Being far-sighted, I have come to need reading glasses, and these are perfect for my needs.  I can look 'down' through them, and look 'over the frame' for distance, all while they are secured around my head and neck.  I do hiking, using a GPS device, and these glasses allow me to look down at the GPS device in my hand, while also looking forward towards my path of travel.  Thank you for the innovative product 
 David Sedaris is the only man I LOVE to listen to ...that voice...the perfect pacing...the droll humor...His stories are a compelling listen with a large drop of "I need to see this man on a book tour" thrown in.  The Carnegie Hall reading is another classic that even someone not familiar with him can fully enjoy. The audience is not as distracting as you would think and he plays to them well without a lot of big pauses for all the applause. I've given this as a gift with not a complaint!  A Good Listen 
 This is a taut thriller from one of my favorite authors.  The plot follows a newly released convict who is trying to find out who murdered his son, a LAPD cop.  The story twists and turns from there,  This is a whodunit that will keep you guessing, especially since you can't put this down.  This would make a great Bruce Willis movie just as Hostage, by the same author did 
 If you are a good parent you must get a copy of "Where The Wild Things Are". This is a story of a very bad boy's day of imaginative roll playing and final acceptance of his place in the real world. I love reading it to my children and watching as their little faces lit up in recognition of adventures they had endured during their own periods of bad behavior... Check it out and get it for your little "darlings".  Another MUST HAVE for your children is the series "Why Some Cats are Rascals" . Very captivating and touching stories showing the world with cats eyes.  Especially good is Book 3.

 For someone just starting out in the painting feild, acrylic or otherwise, this book is gold. It has all the basic information one needs to create an image. If you want to paint, but don't know where to start, this will definately be the book for you 
 After reading reviews, I decided to take a chance on this film.  I was pleasantly suprised by the acting, content and storyline.  For those that must know, it's an adult comedy.  Yes, there were serious parts in the film, but to say more is to give it away.  Somehow, someway, I think there are people that may relate to the characters (needing love, having to have needs fulfilled, etc).  The only reason why I didn't give the movie 5 stars is the very, very end of the move.  I had an issue with the treatment of the passing of one of the characters (too quick, not enough depth).  None-the-less, a good film!  Four stars 
 Locust does a great job of showing the ugly side of the shiny veneer of Hollywood. The book deals with lust, desire, hope, disappointment, failure, rage, and death. To avoid being misleading, I should say that the movie business is not the front and center story here. The interpersonal relationships between a woman and her father and her suitors is the main plotline. Hollywood acts as a backdrop.  Faye is a failed actress who only gets work as an extra, and Homer and Todd are just two of the men who are drunk with desire for her.  This alternates with The Sound and the Fury for my favorite book. I've read it 3 times, which is as much as I've read any book.  ...Locust is a quick read and never boring. Check out the movie too 
 This is not a light read, nor should it be.  While reading this book, you will not be wanting of information.  Frank has loaded this volume with incredible detail.  I did not give this book the full 5 star review because it needed a few more maps, eventhough the maps it contains are good.  There is a plethera of names to deal with from the islands to the Japanese officers to the US officers to the ship names.  This is a very thorough treatment of this critical campaign.  This will stand as great reference book and a welcome addition to a WWII library. The reader should be forewarned that this is not a casual read and if one is looking for a more abridged treatment, I would refer to the Samuel Eliot Morison's volume V of the History of Naval Operations in WWII 
 I am absolutely in love with this movie. It's a real documentary, not a mocumentary, but it is hilarious. The special features on the DVD aren't amazing, but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful 
 This is the original story, well told.  I rate it at 4, versus 5, stars, though, because of the illustrations.  Although absolutely beautiful, from an artistic point of view, they are a little complicated, from a child's  point of view.  For instance, there is an illustration of Goldilocks  sitting on Papa Bear's chair, but no illustration of Mama Bear's chair or  Goldilocks trying it out.  Same for the beds.  The main illustrations are  framed with smaller illustrations which seem to be referencing all that  Goldilocks does, but I bought this book for my two year old (who LOVES it),  and I think it would be clearer for him if it had more explicit  illustrations 
  Wallace Beery plays a prizefighter past his prime, more interested now in boozing and gambling than in fighting anymore. His son (Jackie Cooper) lives with him and idolizes him. Beery accidentally runs into his ex-wife one day - she's now rich - and she convinces him that Cooper would be better off with her. (Child custody "laws" were quite different back then.) He reluctantly goes with his mother, but before long runs away back to dear old dad. The climax comes during a boxing match in which Beery, after being terribly pummelled by his younger opponent, miraculously wins with his last punch, only to die in the dressing room a short while later.   Beery is engrossing - the role fits him like a glove, and Cooper isn't too bad either (except for the long crying jag at the end, which tore audiences up back then, and may still do so today). The technical limitations of 1931 contribute a great deal to the overly theatrical and somewhat wooden acting styles, but the movie is not afraid to wear its emotions on its sleeve, which was always its great appeal. Beery won an Oscar as The Champ 
  Driving home in the wee hours from the Indy airport, there is no better accompaniment that Joni Mitchell on BLUE.  Seldom are whimsy and reflection caught so well without damaging the wings.  This CD is sparely orchestrated. Lots of Joni's own guitar and piano foot the bill. Her voice is very versatile, though she occasionally blemishes a song by forcing its limits.  After all these years, she still tells an awesome story. 
 I first read this book when I was in RN school.  I thought to myself, "What am I getting into?"  But I loved the book, and I couldn't put it down!  I loaned it to a friend and have since bought two more copies.  Now that I have been an RN for a year, I see more of what the nurses in Echo Heron's book go through every day.  And, even though I am worried about what the future holds for my profession as the nursing shortage looms above us, I have never been more proud of the title that I have.  I love my job, and all that it means.  I am very proud to be a nurse, and am also very proud to share my profession with someone like Echo Heron, who is not afraid to tell anyone what she thinks, and she is usually right on the money.  Keep writing Echo, and we will keep reading 
 I listened to this on LP when I was a kid...I knew all the words and learned to sing "high" by singing with Glen.  He is still just an awesome performer, and it's so good to know that this is here for us "old folks" to buy and share with our children to show them what REAL music is 
 I have owned a copy of this book for nearly 20 years, and each time I read it, it remains as fresh as the first time. I am at an advantage, because, living in Yorkshire, means that I have visted nearly every place, featured in the book.  Believe me, it is just as beautiful in real life, as it is presented in this book. Yorkshire is affectionately known by we "Yorkies", as "God's Own Country", and to us, it is. We have bought this copy for a very dear friend of ours who lives in North Carolina, and we hope that he receives the pleasure which we do, by opening up the pages into a real insight of Yorkshire 
 Joan and Mark de Brecon are all alone in this world.  Their home was captured and parents killed by order of Guy Leighton, an evil knight reputed to be Roger Mortimer's assassin. Roger Mortimer, by the way, is the Queen's lover. Guy was ordered to the Brecon keep to destroy it and also dispose of the entire family, but he became enamored with Joan and so struck a bargain with her: In exchange for Mark's life, she would become his lover.  Joan endured the horror of being with Guy every night until she and Mark were able to escape. They made it to London where Joan was able to find work as a tiler and make money on the side by selling religious statues she made out of clay.  While she's at the market selling her wares, she meets Rhys, a wealthy freemason who has done work for the royal family. He rescues Joan several times, first when one of Mortimer's squires attacks her and also when he finds her in the town stocks, punished for selling damaged statues.  Rhys and Joan are drawn to each other but Joan is like a wounded animal, fiercely attacking anyone who tries to come near her and refusing to trust anybody. Through his kindness, Joan learns to trust Rhys but not entirely for she refuses to share the horrific story of what happened to her family or that her and Mark are on the run.  Despite what her head tells her, Joan loses her heart to Rhys and just when she's starting to relax, her past catches up with her.  I think the best thing about this story is the author's prose.  She weaves a beautiful tale of two souls melded into one. It's something so special that you won't see the words "I love you" anywhere in the story, because to add to it will simply take away from it. Who else can use words to paint a picture of the coming together of two people as they work together to do something so ordinary as molding clay?  I am enamored with this tale. The storyline is solid with plenty of subplots to add a sense of richness to it. Rhys and Joan have to navigate dangerous intrigue to stay alive and also to bring to justice the man who murdered Joan's parents and raped her repeatedly. I don't have any complaints nor see anything lacking in the story. Needless to say, Madeline Hunter is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  She is as gifted a writer as they come.  
 Well known composer Jesper Kyd (Hitman 2, Hitman: Contracts, Freedom Fighters, and more) has joined forces with the legendary Nile Rodgers' Sumthing Else Music Works record label and Sumthing Distribution to release the original soundtrack from the video game Robotech: Invasion.  The score Kyd composed for the game mixes live choral performances by the Hungarian Radio Choir along with electronic and symphonic elements.  "We hired Jesper Kyd to create the music for Robotech: Invasion because of the work he has done in the past," states Eric Peterson, President of Vicious Cycle Software, Inc., the developers of the game. "The music awards that Jesper has received over the years for games is a testament to the quality of his work. He created a fantastic score for our game and we couldn't be happier with the results. The music is dark, action-packed and full of variety - creating the pace that we wanted to have in the game. 
 	The youth of Frank McCourt is one that I would never wish upon any other human being.  Often starving or ill, his whole family is disjoint and falling apart whether in Brooklyn, New York or Limerick, Ireland.  His father's alcoholism and his younger siblings' mortality rate both enrage and soften the reader of this tremendous memoir.  He constantly captures these moments of his childhood wonderfully in his seven-year-old voice.  His description of his father's desire for his sons to die for Ireland is almost comically scary, "He's pushing in our door and singing, And if, when all a vigil keep, The West's asleep, The West's asleep!  Alas! And well my Erin weep, That Connnacht lies in slumber deep, But hark! A voice like thunder spake `The West's awake!  The West's awake! Sing, Oh hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake'" (111).  The way that McCourt captures the voice of his drunken, patriotic father is heartbreakingly wonderful.  Telling the whole story through his own eyes as he grows up himself adds a level to the storytelling that few other authors can mimic.  If you liked Mary Karr's The Liars' Club, you will love Angela's Ashes in the same way.  Both Karr and McCourt capture the voice of a child perfectly.  Another thing that McCourt does with scenes like this is to present to the reader the rich passion his father has for Ireland and set the scene of his childhood even better.  As Karr did with her father's loyalty to Texas, McCourt does with his father's obsession with his homeland.  Both of them use specific scenes with each parent to really deliver the story of their lives.  Angela's Ashes blew me away and I would recommend it to anyone. 
 This cd is downright awesome.  He's really gonna make it in country music just like his daddy did, Mr. Randy Owen, lead singer from the greasest country music band ever, ALABAMA!!  The father and son duel "You Can Thank Dixie" has their family tradition all over it and growing up country music, Mr. Jake Owen is gonna have to try to screw it up to fail, as long as he stays true to himself he'll become a legend just like his father did.

 Good job Govenor!  We are proud of you and what you've done politically and health wise.  Your book was very inspiring.  I had already been doing a lot of what you did, but I got more agressive about getting off my duff and exercising.  Oh the water, that's a lot of water to drink, lol.  We really hope to see you run in 2008.  Vicki Martin Woo 
 This the most amazing story of true love I have ever read...love between God and His daughters!  I read this book in a small group of women and we all were blown away by this book.  The ideas Leslie brings forward are surprisingly obvious yet they had never occured to any of us before.  This is a must read for all women 
 The Tao of Tango is successful because it probes the right questions. As the result of "feminism", we can enjoy a fairer balance of power with men, but what femininity is still remains a complete mystery to us. The book dares to praise passivity, surrendering and following, and reminds us that those words can still carry derogative connotations. At the same time it tells us about male and female energies present in each one of us and with that, it frees us of limiting patterns of behavior.   Dancing Tango is a beautiful way to play, rehearse and observe how we are as women and men. The Tao of Tango refers to it in a provocative, measured and grounded way.

 I work as a business intermediary assisting clients in both selling and buying their business. I always recommend that first-time business buyers purchase and read this book 
 The below 8 pages of reviews are mostly low rated entries who knock on the fiction of military abilities and weaponry, the so called lack of a plot, and more. Let me tell you a few things that will contradict those reviews.  First off, let me start out by saying that I just got Ice Station, Area 7 and Scarecrow about 5 days ago and have since finished all of them. This is because the pace of the books are frantic. I rarely put the books down and hated to do so. They will keep you pulled into the story and waiting for the next unbelievable thing to happen.   Secondly, these books read like an action movie. I have seen people below comment on the "Hit, hit, hit - Miss" parts of the book but the way Reilly writes is he uses onomatopoeias to put you into the vision he has of each scene, sound and all. Because these books are structured around that action format you will see, or rather read, amazing scenes that would never happen in real life, like the disarmament of a missile mid-flight while flying next to it. These are no different from James Bond driving a car with his cell phone in the back seat while being shot at.   Third, you MUST love action to enjoy this book. Bottom-line. There are parts in Scarecrow that will make you cheer for the hero and laugh at insane action sequences in amazement, one of those "Holy s***....did that just happen??" You are supposed to read to escape reality and Reilly does an excellent job of painting a picture of insane action to do just that.   Fourth (and final) point. People have complained over the lack of character development and say that the plot in the book is too complex to keep up with...Wrong. Character development occurs throughout the series and if you haven't read the series there will be pieces missing as the 3 books put the stories of the Marines together. Lack of a plot?? No way, each book is masterful in integrating so many side-stories that run together and meet in the middle in usually bloody, action-packed scenes. If you read fast and want to keep up with the plot you are almost forced to keep reading and you will take in all that is going on and remember each piece and later when you come to the last piece of a "mini-plot" everything falls together.  Scarecrow is amazingly well done, I finished in in about 5 hours because I read so intently. I can't wait to see more from this author. The stories are military based but are a far cry from the Tom Clancy library. Rather than go into hundreds of pages of slow plots and boring military speak you are thrust into a novel that a casual reader can pick up and won't put down. Now I can't wait for the movies and see if they match up to the pace of the books.   5/5 - Must read. However it would behove you to read them in chronological order or you may missing pieces to the puzzle. 
 I upgraded from a Sony MZ-NH900 (which I still have) to the RH1 primarily for three reasons: the OLED display; its ability to retain manual recording settings without having to navigate through the menus to re-set it to manual recording for each recording; and because I just plain wanted it.  I was already pretty happy with the recordings my NH900 made, so why are these things a big deal for me?  Because I primarily record my kids' concerts, which are in dimly-lit auditoriums.  The NH900 display is totally unusable in poor light situations.  And even when I can see it, I almost always use Manual recording volume settings.  It is a large PITA to go into the menu to re-set my preferred recording settings each and every time.  With the RH1, the beautiful display is clearly visible in every light situation.  And whenever you go into Record, it automatically uses the same settings you used last time, so I never have to fiddle around with it.  And the display on the machine shows recording levels which allow you to optimize the level (which you can change on the fly with the jog lever) for whatever type of sound you are recording.  Build quality is very nice.  Sleek metal casing.  I have no problems with the buttons...even the Eject button, which seems to kind of stick out further than it needs to, is fine because it cannot be engaged while the RH1 is recording.  The RH1 is optimized for recording, no doubt.  But it is also an excellent playback machine as well.  I believe it has a slightly better bass output than the NH900 when using Shure E3c canal phones which are a little thin on bass.  If I could add *one* thing to the RH1, it would be the add-on AA battery case which comes with the NH900.  That would add much welcome recording and playback capacity when I have it out on the road without the means to recharge, or having to carry the A/C charger. [... 
 For those of you who have followed all of Poyer's books, this is his best yet ! He veers from his normal naval tales to one of a Force Recon Team in the Persian Gulf War, Although Dan Lenson is still a central character, the cast is well described and the plot exciting 
 You're generally in one of two camps when it comes to Nin. It was true when she was alive and it seems to be just as true now that she's dead. If you're in the camp that loves her, you will love this diary. Her writing is beautiful. I've read the biographies of her and I know that she had a tendency to embellish the facts or even to outright lie, but that doesn't destroy my enjoyment of her diaries in the least. If the pages contained in her journals are not an exact representation of the reality she was living (is there such a thing?) they are a representation of her life the way she wanted to see it...and really, isn't that what being an artist is all about? She gives a very clear image of a world that is completely alien to most of us; a world that many of us might like to find but have never had the courage to seek. She writes of a world full of artists and lovers and intellectual friends...a world full of life and eaters of life. It's magnificent. Truth or fiction, it doesn't matter to me 
 My daughter loves this book. There are a variety of stories and a glossary in the back of the book so you know how to pronounce the spanish words. It's a great book 
 Seems like everyone wants to have a open source project these days.  But it's not as easy to run a successful project as you might think.  In order to get started on the right foot and increase your chance of success, I would recommend reading Karl Fogel's Producing Open Source Software - How To Run A Successful Free Software Project.  Contents: Introduction; Getting Started; Technical Infrastructure; Social and Political Infrastructure; Money; Communications; Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development; Managing Volunteers; Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents; Free Version Control Systems; Free Bug Trackers; Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?; Example Instructions for Reporting Bugs; Index  Fogel definitely has the "cred" to write this book.  He's spent five years working on the Subversion open source version control system.  While not (yet?) the default open source version control system out there, it's rapidly gaining traction.  As a result, you figure that Fogel and company must have done a few things right along the way.  He does a very nice job in explaining what makes for a successful open source project in terms of tools, structure, and most importantly, culture.  He identifies open source projects that have successfully created a culture that encourages participation without dictatorial control.  He even addresses how to deal with people issues like monopolizing discussion boards.  Those are items that most techies aren't good at, and having a guide like this is priceless.  At times the book seems to be rather dense, as in a lot of text with little to break it up.  I think it's because there's no real use of graphics or code samples to a large degree.  I wouldn't expect it in a book like this, either.  But still, it's just one of those things that came to mind as I was reading it.  If you have the same nagging feeling and can quickly identify it, then it's easy to deal with the problem.  Very valuable information, all condensed into a single volume for easy reference.  I'd maintain that anyone looking to start an open source project with hopes of long-term viability would do well to read and digest this book before starting.  You'll make fewer false starts and raise your chances of success.. 
 Here is the actual track listing (amazon is wrong)  1. Halftime - Even though this is the leading single I don't really care for it. 7/10 2. Slow Motion [Remix] - This song is too played out to have a remix 7/10      3. Take Your Clothes Off - very crunk 10/10   4. Do It - The CRUNKEST SONG 10/10 5. In the Club - (female r&b) hasn't grown on me 5/10    7. Get Crunk Shorty - nick cannon, why? just the beat is tight 6/10  these remixes are basically like the originals, if you liked them you will probably like the new ones. 6. Me & My Brother [Remix]     8. Georgia Dome [Remix]        9. Salt [Shaker Remix]         10. Salt Shaker [Extended Remix]    For the $7, this is still well worth it just for song 3 & 4.  Plus you get all the videos on the bonus dvds, the cribs episode is one of the funniest things ive seen. 
 I was so excited to find this on amazon.  My son has collected Pokemon since he was two. His is now 13 and, while he no longer plays with the items, he loves the collection.  He really wanted the original season on CD in order to complete the collection from his "childhood."  While I don't know if he will actually watch them, to see the satisfaction on his face when he got them was wonderful 
 Clif bars make for a tasty and pleasant snack. They are perfect when you simply don't have a lot of time to get something into you to keep you going. [...]they are an excellent source of vitamins C and E.   They are very chewy and satisfying; you won't need more than one or two before you workout. They are much more nutritious than a candy bar, too.   However, this snack bar is not perfect. As another reviewer notes, there is quite a bit of sugar, carbohydrates and fat in each bar. This food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains salt; and people with allergies to any kind of nuts should definitely not eat this food.  Overall, Clif Nutrition Bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthier alternative to a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I recommend them as a delicious snack food.   
 I received this machine for christmas because my wife knows that i usually get one cup of coffee in the middle of the day at work.  This machine is easy to use and works great.  It works using the home cafe pods well, but i tried the Melitta java pods, and i got brown water.  The Melitta pods state that they are designed exclusively for use with "the one:one coffee maker" You can get most coffee flavors using the Home cafe pods though. Pods may not be the most cost effective way to make coffee, but it sure is easy 
 Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime.  However - it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible to re-capture, and in a sense, haunting.  I am not obsessive in any way but I have watched this movie at least twenty times - with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for comfort.    The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category - so buy it and watch it.  You'll be glad you did.  Mik 
 Constance Chatterley's gamekeeper, Mellors, brings out the animal in Her Ladyship, and he extends the protection to her that he does to all the wild game in the wood.  It is Mellors himself who, in the end, understands that his own baronet, Sir Clifford, is the greatest threat to his most vulnerable charge.  Constance's own father, Sir Malcolm, fails utterly to appreciate the situation when he refers to Mellors as the quintessential poacher himself.  Sir Malcolm's mistake is that he, along with all of polite society, fails to recognize that humans are, in fact, animals, and that the thrill of conjugal intimacy unites us with all other fauna.  We strayed from this notion long ago, with Plato extolling virtuous love, and referring to passions and desires as evil (Book IX of the Phaedrus).     Sir Clifford, who is impotent as a result of war injuries, suggests to his wife that she have a discrete affair in order to produce an heir to the estate.   "I don't care who his father may be as long as he is a healthy man not below normal intelligence."  His admonition that Connie be careful not to fall in love in the process foreshadows his tragedy.  When we see the gamekeeper, Mellors, placing pheasant eggs into the nests of chickens, in order that they may be reared by surrogate hens, we know, before any of the protagonists themselves, just who Lady Chatterley's surrogate husband will be.  Ultimately Connie discovers that Mellors has that rarest of qualities in a man; he enjoys making love only when his partner enjoys it, too.  These feelings are a sharp contrast with her experience as well as his, and they are both immediately ensnared in a tense carnal conspiracy.  In the process, we are treated to D. H. Lawrence's craft:  "Both sisters mixed with...the young Cambridge group, the group that stood for 'freedom' and flannel trousers, and soft shirts open at the neck, and a well-bred sort of emotional anarchy..., and an ultra-sensitive sort of manner."  Tevershall village had "rows of wretched, small begrimed brick houses with black slate roofs for lids, sharp angles, and willful blank dreariness."  One attraction of her first lover, Michalis, is that he had his own ideas and stated them clearly; "he didn't merely walk round them with millions of words, in the parade of the life of the mind."  Sir Clifford "seemed alert in the foreground, but the background was like the Midlands atmosphere, haze, smoky mist."  Before her affair with Mellors, Connie saw sex as "just a cocktail term for an excitement that bucked you up for a while, then left you more raggy than ever."  Connie realizes of Clifford that, "like many insane people, his insanity might be measured by the things he was not aware of: the great desert tracts in his consciousness."  "She saw her own nakedness in his eyes..."   This book will not titillate the reader of 2006 as it did the reader of 1928.  The reaction against it then exposed both widespread hypocrisy and a scientifically illiterate, pre-Kinsey society which extolled Platonic values, and in the process denied the incomparable delight of primitive intimacy.  
 The mystery is a bit trite and too neatly wrapped up at the end, but this  remains a good read because of Peter's strong characters and setting and  great metaphysical questioning 
 This book is about 10 years old so if you are taking one of the newer drugs you will have to find additional resources. Except for the above mentioned newer drugs this book is an absolute must. There are so many problems with the drugs that people take that it is almost unbelieveable. The side affects are all carefully spelled out. Every drug is a balancing act. You have to balance the hoped-for benefit of the drug versus any and all adverse side affects. Many times the side affects are not worth the risk especially if gains can be made by nutrition and exercise, in some other holistic way or by taking an alternative safer drug 
 This series of books is a beast that has possessed me with its great storylines, characters and cliffhanger endings.  Kudoes to LaHaye 
 first off, Joseph from Montreal QC has no idea what he's talking about his review was completely false. The Nazi's, as history presesnts, were wicked, ruthless and uncaring people. their goal was to eliminate all the Jews in Europe not make friends with them. Joseph from Montreal QC doesn't have the correct information. He sounds like a Nazi sympathizer to me.   Anyway this movie is wonderful. watch it you will enjoy every moment in i 
 Ella and Louis worked hard to produce this album in 1956; and today many fans of this music still marvel at its beauty. Their voices rich, vibrant and energetic as ever, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong were a duo that remains incomparable. This CD proves it.  Although the CD starts off with the playful "Can't We Be Friends," most of the music on this CD has a slow, relaxed and pensive feel to it that is remarkable. I love their romantic renditions of "Moonlight In Vermont;" "They Can't Take That Away From Me;" "Tenderly" and "Cheek To Cheek." Moreover, they perform very gracefully on "Stars Fell On Alabama." The CD ends with the classic ballad "April In Paris."  I initially thought the CD was too slow and I was not sure if I liked the album. However, the second time I listened I felt more comfortable with the pace. After I listened to the CD the third time I finally understood the importance of the "slower" feel to the songs. The songs become much more romantic, pensive and substantial at this pace.   The liner notes include the original notes from the LP release of this album; and there are nice photos of Ella and Louis on the reverse of the liner notes. In fact, the cover photo of Ella and Louis is my favorite of them together. Ella and Louis appear warm, friendly and approachable--and that's precisely the way the entire album comes across once you get into its "slower" pace. Very clever!   Overall, this is an excellent CD for fans of classic vocals, jazz, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and duets. It is affordable so it is also a great way to find out if you'll like this kind of music. The quality of the sound is excellent.  Highly recommended!    ENJOY!!! 
 I laughed out loud while I read this book. I was surprised that it is so slim, yet each story is packed with humor. The reader cannot help but enjoy the Professor's adventures in the crazy academic world of Philology. This is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors don't complain about the laughter 
 I'll start off by saying this: don't be deceived by the cartoony cover. It's actually probably the best HTDM (How to Draw Manga) book I own. It teaches you everything from the origin of manga, to backgrounds, different coloring methods, chibis, robots, comics, and, of course, the basics of drawing characters.  Pages 6-7 cover the tools of drawing manga. It explains what kind of paper you need (size and such), what kind of pencils are best, what kind of eraser is best, and much more.  Page 8 explains anime/manga related terms, and even the origin of manga itself. The terms covered are anime, bishoujo, bishounen, chibi, doujinshi, kawaii, manga, otaku, RPG, shoujo, and shounen.  Page 9 gives illustrations of the eight step process the pros use to create manga. They include brainstorming, writing the script and drawing a rough layout, penciling (which, as a side note, I found was misspelled in the book), lettering, inking, lettering, erasing, coloring, and (finally) publishing.  Page 10 discusses the basic elements of manga style. This has a quick explanation of how hair, mouths, and noses or manga characters differ from that of standard American comic books.  Page 11 tells the origin and differences of shounen and shoujo. In case you didn't know, shoujo (as quoted from page 8)"refers to comics aimed at young males", and shoujo "refers to comics aimed at young girls".  Pages 12-15 point out some basic elements of heroes and villains. The heroes include "the dashing hero", "the magical girl", "the rebellious hero", "the big guy", "the kid", and "the mascot". The villains include "the big bad", "the evil queen", "the fallen hero", and "mindless goons".   Pages 16-17 basically explain that everything drawn is a collection of basic shapes. It also gives you a few examples of three-dimensional figures.  Page 18 is very helpful. It explains about light sources, and how shadows work.  Page 19 discusses and gives examples of the difference between soft shading and cel shading.  Pages 20-21 show the difference between coloring in markers, colored pencils, watercolors, acrylic on acetate, and computer coloring. I found these two pages to be quite helpful.  Pages 22-23 cover manga eyes. It shows the difference between male and female eyes, and shows you the steps of drawing both. Personally, I wish they had more examples on faces instead of simply drawn directly onto the page.  Pages 24-25 explain hair styles. These pages are incredibly informative! It gives you a color chart that includes several colors and what the typical personality is for its wearer (for example, blue = youthful, energetic, cool and introverted; red = energetic, good fighter, outspoken, stubborn and strong-willed.) and a picture of several styles and the typical personality of its wearer (long, straight hair: Traditional and down-to-earth; spiky: Energetic and youthful; ponytails: Cute, energetic, and a little ditzy.)  Pages 26-31 demonstrate how to draw faces facing forward, to the side, and even a three-quarter view.  Pages 32-33 have a list of emotions and a small example. The list is large and includes twenty-one emotions. They are pleased, laughing, happy, joyous, embarrassed, confused, sleepy, sly, pouting, bored, annoyed, angry, enraged, shocked, terrified, worried, crying, bawling, blubbering, yawning, and smug.   Pages 34-36 break down proportions for the adult male and female, the teenaged male and female, the young female and male, the chibi male and female, and one super-deformed female. I was quite pleased to see children who weren't chibis. Most How-To-Draw books only include how to draw chibi children. And best of all, no nudity!  Pages 37-38 explain a little bit about poses. This section is very short compared to most HTDM and quite uninformative.  Page 39 also isn't very helpful. It explains a bit about foreshortening.  Page 40 gives fantastic demonstrations of hands, as well as a great measurement tip.  Page 41 is great for drawing feet. It shows a few different poses, and even a foot in a high heel shoe.  Pages 42-43 focus on clothing. Page 42 centers on the flow and detail of clothing; while page 43 reminds you of the manga-specific clothing, such as kimonos, samurai armor, and the oh-so popular school uniforms. This page also has an example of two styles of uniforms for both girls and boys. I find myself referring to this section often.  Pages 44-85 include an example of many different characters as well as some tips and characteristics. The characters include the mischievous chibi, dashing hero, magical girl, rebellious hero, the kid (shounen), girls (shoujo), the big guy, the mascot, fallen hero, evil queen, the big bad, mindless goons, unstoppable fiend, fantasy warrior, elf princess warrior, martial artists, cat girl, android boy, Victorian rose (bishoujo), school girl (bishoujo), Victorian gentleman (bishounen), hipster student, skate girl (shounen youth), cyberpunk kid (shounen youth), space hero, space pirate, mecha, humanoid robot, and the crab robot. Most of them include a drawing in both colored pencil and computer colored.  Pages 86-87 give some interesting tips on martial art moves and battles.  Pages 88-89 remind you to consider the weight of weapons in your drawings. For being the weapons section, it isn't elaborate as most HTDM.  Pages 90-93 show examples of different actions and explains some important details such as what a character does when he/she jumps.  Pages 94-97 aren't necessarily for beginners. These pages are very, very helpful for hard core manga artists. These two pages cover the basics of linear perspective, and drawing figure in perspective. They go into amazing detail and explanation.  Pages 90-105 list some very helpful tips of drawing backgrounds and such. The examples include city buildings, the fantasy castle, the space station, and the traditional Japanese home.  Pages 106-113 show you how to draw vehicles. In order, the examples included are a jumbo jet (simple sketch only), old car (simple sketch only), sporty car, flying car, sky cycle, good-guy space fighter, pirate space fighter, good-guy spaceship, and pirate spaceship.  Pages 114-121 are about the design of a manga page. Now, the comics aren't good at all, but the pointers are. This includes the basic elements of a manga page (basically defining and giving examples of speed lines, bold lettering, narrative captions, and such), planning a comic page (teaching smooth transition of text), designing dynamic panels (different "camera" angles), basic panel shots (mostly different panel sizes), and pacing and panel flow (great tips on how to set up an interesting and sensible panel).  Page 122 defines the different kinds of word balloons and shows some lettering options.  Page 123 discusses sound effects. This page also includes sound effects in both English and Japanese. This page is also great to refer to when you'd like to see the meaning of a Japanese sound effect while reading manga.  Page 124 covers features commonly found in manga, such as speed lines, the big head yell, and falling cherry blossoms.  And finally...  Page 126 summarizes "the business of making manga". This covers six steps of drawing manga professionally. Step One: Know your strength and weaknesses Step Two: Meet people and get feedback Step Three: Promote your work Step Four: Be persistent Step Five: Keep Learning Step Six: Stick with it  Thanks for reading my (incredibly long) review 
 Deborah Crombie is stepping into the realm of the psychlogical thriller genre with this book.  And she can stand up against some of the masters such as Barbara Vine or Elizabeth George.  I am a huge fan of this series, and I found this book a little different than the previous ones in the series.  For one we have excerpts in the book where Ms. Crombie steps into the mind of a psycopath.  In this book Gemma and Duncan are on a Christmas holiday at Duncan's home.  The festivities are soon marred by many dark and dangerous happenings.  It starts when Duncan's sister finds the mummefied body of a baby in the wall of an old barn.  Before the mystery is unravelled there is a murder.  What Ms. Crombie does so well is the characters and the family relationships, and this book is full of these.  I truly enjoyed this story.  I understand why we had to wait another year before we could read it.  This book was to come out last year.  It is a complex and rich tale, that shows Gemma and Duncan in a different light.  In this book they aren't "on the job" so to speak, so lose some of their official clout 
 The people of every period in history tend to think that the time in which they live is somehow special: dramatically better than, or worse than, or in some way fundamentally different from all the times that came before. (And/or the people of today are *themselves* somehow different from the people of yesterday.) Historians these days are digging past these commonly held ideas and finding that the "truth" (as near as one can approach it) is not that simple; things do change, but there's also a lot of continuity through history--which is often the more surprising story. One of the things I like so much about Future Hype is that, although it isn't a history book and *certainly* isn't an academic book, it shares a similar sensibility and a similar conception of historical change: that change (technological and social change, in this case) is usually not catastrophic or revolutionary (or "exponential"), and that our own place in history is not all that privileged, after all.  So this was obviously a book whose message I was already willing to receive; yet I feel I learned a lot from it. The author presents a model of historical (technological/social) change that is complex enough to be believable and simple enough to be understandable. It also has made me much more aware of the prevalence of "future hype" in many areas of life. One area in which that hype really thrives, of course, is advertising. The author's overall argument, I think, encourages people to be skeptical of advertisers' claims, and in many ways he really is encouraging (most) people *not* to buy the latest gadgets. Let the early adopters adopt the fancy new toy, he says, and even when it does eventually become "tried and true," ask yourself whether you really need it. (I read in an interview that Seidensticker's PDA is a 3x5 notecard and a pencil.) So, essentially, he's advising consumers to take it easy and not be so worried about keeping up with the Joneses. His advice is timely for businesses and other institutions that need to make decisions about what to buy, as well.  I've been speaking somewhat abstractly so far, but the book is anything but abstract. This is one case where the delightfully colorful cover well represents the lively entertainment within. In addition to being a persuasive argument about technology and society, it's also chock-full of entertaining stories about technology and change from the last 20 years, the last century, the last thousand years, the last eight thousand years. One story that keeps making me smile is the one about the farmer who just couldn't believe that the telegraph could transfer a message faster than his team of horses--so he challenged the telegraphers to a race. He lost. Seidensticker's point is that new technologies have been delighting, scaring, and surprising people for a long, long time. So the book promotes a more educated and skeptical attitude toward technology, a more realistic perspective, and does so by taking time to entertain the reader with lots of fun stories. It reminded me quite a bit of Carl Sagan. (And is there any higher praise? 
 but that makes it very entertaining. Amusing stories, pictures and one-liners. Also a lot of "fun to know" about courses and players 
 Bananarama were one of the most successful British pop groups of the eighties, having a long string of hits with the production team of Stock, Aitken and Waterman. SAW have their critics (and I'm not keen on some of the stuff they produced) but Bananarama were better than most of the other acts they produced. So while their music is lightweight, it is enjoyable and makes great party music.  Bananarama made the top five in the UK with eight different singles while two others made the UK top ten. Two of these (Help / Beatles and Venus / Shocking blue) were covers, the others being It ain't what you do, Really saying something, Shy boy, Na na hey hey kiss him goodbye, Cruel summer, Robert De Niro's waiting, Love in the first degree and I want you back.  My favorite song here is Love in the first degree, which is completely different from the Alabama song with the same title. Similarly, I want you back (another original song) is different from the Jacksons' song, though both were in the UK charts at the same time, the Jacksons' song having been re-mixed.  This compilation contains all their top ten hits and several of their lesser hits including Nathan Jones, I heard a rumour, I can't help it and Preacher man, all of which made the UK top twenty 
 You'll find that the outer of the two DVD's will come loose in shipping many times. As both discs rest on the same spindle, the outer one will often come loose and bounce around in the packaging as it's shipped resulting in a scratched DVD.  I just hope this one doesn't promise extras on the package that aren't actually on the DVD 
 This story hooks you immediately and keeps up a fast pace throughout. If you like Koontz's style, you won't be disappointed with this entry 
 First off... this is an essential book. Do note that it can be downloaded for free from the FAA:  [...]  ...but many times it's better to have the print version. There are some vendors selling illegal CD versions of this on Amazon when you purchased that are not paperback as listed. Do NOT accept this if they send you a CD. Demand the print, book version if you purchase it - and do not tolerate the scams 
 I bought my first ear grip from a home improvement store.  I work outdoors everyday and really need to keep all exposed areas covered. The Ear Grip works great!  Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isnt as noticeable as other options.  Since it is worn around the back of the head/neck it also keeps your neck warm too.  Compared to other ear muffs I have seen the Ear Grip wont make you look like a fairy.  There is no fluff/wild colors/fur here and you are still able to hear out of them.  They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric.  The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric thats covering it is more than enough to keep you warm.   You can also take them off in a flash and compact them with a push and turn so they will fit in any pocket.  I highly reccomend them 
 Wonderful!  I loved this series when it was on TV, never missed an episode.  I have been yearning for the quailty programming of the past. Thank you! Television, recently, has been very disappointing.  You find a good series, get hooked, and then for creative/money differences it's cancelled.  I do not want watch any new series...what's the point?  Stick with the oldies but goodies............ 
 Milton Friedman, now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia. "Capitalism and Freedom" dispels the so-called myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society. The book was orignally writeen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made. However, they are points that never go out of sytle. He refutes the lie that the free-market caused the depression (it was actually a tyrannical Federal Reserve), that socialism can be democratic, and others. Friedman discusses public education, roads, minimum wage laws (which he calls, "the most anti-black law on the books,"), as well as the how so-called "progressive" tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor.  Please understand that Friedman is NOT a "right-wing" extremist as some knucklehead below states. He is a libertarian. He developed the idea of the negative income tax to help the poor. His ideas were to help people not hurt them with the free-market. Someone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. 
 As a 4th grade teacher, I've been looking for a book with exercises that will help my students with their writing - something with short, easy to digest information, and something that will allow them to write just a paragraph (as opposed to 1-2 pages).  I think this book looks to be the ticket.  I've not used it yet, but the components are all there.  There are 18 lessons, each containing tips for the teacher, 2 paragraph rewrite challenges, and a "before" and "after" example, which I really like.  The "before" shows what students typically write before employing the recommendations of the tips, and the "after" example shows how the example could be written when using the tips.  Some of the lessons include: repairing run-on sentences, giving specific information, beginning with unusual facts, and using active verbs 
 Monster is a remarkable movie and not just for the obvious artistic reasons.  For one thing, it shows just how degrading lesbianism is.  More importantly, it goes against the feminist position that women should only be portrayed as being victims, not criminals in their own right.  In feminist movies, there are no such things as femme fatales.  All women are depicted as being helpless victims at the hands of evil males.    Monster reminds us that there are evil women, such as Aileen Wuornos, who are capable of the most fiendish things, including violence against men.  For this reason alone, Monster is a most remarkable movie that completely goes against the feminist grain.  
 You cannot stare at the sun or count all the stars in the sky.  It is easier to find the needle amongst the hay than it is finding words to describe Paul Weller's solo debut album.  Seems like yesterday when I bought it in a record shop in OKC. I rushed back to my dorm room and pressed play and all of the sudden new breath escaped my mouth as I hear major seven chords and nothern soul vocals swirl around my eager noggin.  I cherished it then but things have changed since.  It has been a decade and nothing in my massive collection of music has grown on me quite like this album.  The sheer magnitude of musicality still gives me goose bumps.  This album is a perfect thing.  Each and every track has taken turns being my "all time favorite" and although I must say that "Amongst Butterflies" is probably the one I most admire...you would be hard pressed to find one easily.  The quality of each track is amazing.  From the heavy 'Into Tomorrow" to the beauty of "I didn't mean to Hurt You".  I know a lot of Weller fans praise "Wild Wood" as his classic watershed moment but I will always agree to disagree.  As much as I love "Wild Wood"...nothing has a more timeless appeal.  I truly love this album and nothing will ever make me change my mind.  All I want to do is change yours.  Be like the man in the mirror...go ahead, make that change 
 I actually bought this for my stepfatherinlaw who is a retired music instructor and bandleader.  He saw many of these performers live and believes these are very representative of the vigor and energy from their performances he saw here in the US.  He has nothing but praise for these.  I'm eagerly awaiting him to visit again so I can watch them too 
  "Lust is desire raised to a level that prompts unacceptable behavior" is a worthy aphorism to encapsulate the contents of "Speaking of Lust: Stories of Forbidden Desire." This is the first volume in the seven deadly sins series and is a compilation of 17 short stories and Lawrence Block's novella (also named "Speaking of Lust"), the capstone of the collection. The editor Block chose to explore the darker side of humanity, the mortal sin of lust, by handpicking short stories that generally lean towards the macabre with dashes of sex. The skillful writing leads the reader without effort to a world full of double agents and desire perverted. Clive Barker, Paul Bishop, and Ed Gorman, to name a few, are the writers that reward with numerous delicious twists and surprises.  In the first short story, "Crack," by James Hall, a voyeur's obsession over a teenage girl possesses him to a frightful conclusion. The unnamed Fulbright fellow confesses, "In most matters I considered myself a scrupulously moral man. I had always been one who could be trusted with other people's money or their most damning secrets. But like so many of my fellow Puritans I long ago had discovered that when it came to certain libidinous temptations I was all too easily swept off my safe moorings into the raging currents of erotic gluttony." "Crack" is a thorough psychological study of how an innocent beginning becomes pathological.  The characters throughout all of the pieces find themselves powerless to fight a desire that has progressed to a full-blown demon. "Speaking of Lust" is a testament to the power of persistent malcontent thoughts. Evil thoughts eventually have no joy staying inside the ravaged mind and long to be transformed into "unacceptable behavior" for release. The collection examines beautifully how sin does not happen out of the blue. The writers brilliantly illustrate that many bad decisions were made before the ultimate transgressions of murder, suicide, incest, and rape occurred. A showcase of lust gone awry, its inevitable tragic conclusions will leave you fulfilled: or perhaps wanting more.  Bohdan Kot 
 Some of the elements of this book are hard to swallow, bordering on pure fiction.  Although supposedly based on actual events, the wording ("A Large Telco" or "An Electronics Firm") makes it difficult to mentally follow the story by visualizing the events.  A lot of key detail is left out, which makes this book a 4 star.  If you plan to take this book as a literal account of social engineering, it's a 1 star at best.  If you hope to gain some general insight into social engineering, backed up heavily on theory and anecdotes, this is a solid book 
 If Michel Foucault's work has created a new discursive space, then Giorgio Agamben's work has driven a chasm between the existing spaces of between public law and political fact.  Agamben has attempted to define that ambiguous space, to fill it with a description that gives it a tenuous position in the lexicon of modern political theory.  Whether it is a "point of imbalance" or "no man's land" (1), a "zone of undecidability", or a "paradoxical phenomenon" (2) a "threshold of indeterminacy" (3) or a "fictitious lacuna" (31) Agamben has embarked on describing the indescribable, even though the concept is "matched by terminological uncertainty" (4).  Expanding on the ideas expounded by Schmitt and Benjamin, Agamben asserts that the state of exception he describes is no longer a temporary state in times of war or siege, but that it "tends to increasingly appear as the dominant paradigm of government in contemporary politics" (2).  Whether it is now the dominant paradigm or, as Agamben argues, the state of exception "has by now become the rule" (9) may be of scholarly debate.  Agamben does make a good argument that this state he describes is becoming more prevalent especially after the events of September 11, 2001 have brought the United States into this war on terrorism.  This timely essay seems to fit well within this age of security and surveillance brought forth by the Patriot Act and the more recent state of exception from hurricanes Rita and Katrina 
 I have no intention of ever living in the country, or following in Ms. Emery's footsteps. I write historical fiction. Anytime that I need to know ANYTHING about the crafts and ways of rural life, I turn to "Encyclopedia of Country Living." The explanations are clear and to the point and the book and index are well organized, so that it is simple to find the information you need. This is an invaluable aid to anyone undertaking a rural life style and is equally useful to researchers like me 
 Dulles' book offers keen insights into the various models of Church.  It gives the reader permission to have a particular starting point and then assists the reader into broadening one's horizon.  Excellent text for  course work on the Church.  Lay people should be able to comprehend much of  the material.  Excellent text for discussions on what it means to be  church 
 I loved this Amy Tan book, it's an easy read and will have you drawn in right away to the story.  This series written by Amy Tan is easily digestable and enjoyable to read, sometimes it's hard for me to engage a book but the books written by Amy Tan are so colorful and descriptive, it just draws me in and I can't stop reading.  This series is probably the best of it's series, diasecting the mother daughter relationship on such a delicate and complicated subject, a Chinese mother and an American born daughter who unknowingly lets the opportunity escape her to truly understand the intents and passions of her mother.  Bridged by communication gaps and difference in language styles and a mother who might be troubled with dimentia, this mother-daughter journey is plagued with mishaps and turmoil.  When June, the daughter, accepts new reason for her mother's off key personality, June offers too little too late and soon she has too many loose strings of her mother's past that she earlier dismissed as nonsense or retoric, to tie together to make sense.  June traces the pieces back to gain what her mother generously offered her in knowledge, but what becomes clear is the spirit of her mother lives inside of her as she comes to grips with who she is as a person and what her purpose in life is. I loved this book and have read almost the entire Amy Tan series. This book is the HINGE of all Amy Tan books, read this and you'll understand the others with new clarity!  LOVED IT!  WILL READ IT AGAIN!  
 There have been many comments on this book in the ten years since it was first published. I think what Carl Sagan said about the book is perhaps the most accurate: "a breath of fresh air". Contrary to many other people I thought the book by Dennett was easy to read, very well written, very straightforward, and not some sort of heavy philosophical discussion. He has lots of examples and many references to real science. It even contains pictures and many schematics. The basic point of the book is that despite any rumour or suggestions to the contrary, scientific, social, religious, or otherwise, the basic tenants of Darwin's original ideas for the evolution of the species remains sound, and it is the only viable theory of evolution. If anything, it has solidified its standing as a durable and accurate theory of evolution.  Darwin's theory as we understand it should start with a definition, and here I quote a definition: " The process in nature by which, according to Darwin's theory of evolution, only the organisms best adapted to their environment tend to survive and transmit their genetic characteristics in increasing numbers to succeeding generations while those less adapted tend to be eliminated." Dennett points out in his discussions that many non-evolution scientists, that is, those in other fields of research, do not really understand this simple idea. They still seem unwilling to accept the theory, although adaptive change has been proven in the scientific literature through extensive DNA and protein studies - see for example a more recent article 7 years after the Dennett book: February 28, 2002, Nature, authors Nick Smith and Dr Adam Eyre-Walker. They measure (quantitatively) the adaptive changes.  There are a number of sub-themes here and one being Gould's theories of evolution. Gould was famous and in the public eye, but back behind the scenes in the evolution world among his peers - according to Dennett - it seems that the situation was a lot more turbulent and controversial for Gould. Dennett describes Gould's "punctuated equilibrium" theory, a sort of stop start idea of steps in evolution that was supposed to overturn Darwin. Dennett thinks that the elimination of small Darwin adaptive steps was a confused and half baked idea (my paraphrase). This of course contains much irony since Gould himself wrote Wonderful Life based on the errors of Walcott and the Burgess Shale. As pointed out by Dennett elsewhere, Dennett explained to Gould that he was writing the book and was commenting on the flaws in Gould's theory. He met with Gould and received all his publications from Gould. At first Gould was helpful, but when Dennett found the inconsistencies among them, Gould went silent in their communications for almost a year, and refused to answer questions pertaining to Dennett's questions. The problem is that Gould had flip-flopped and back-tracked over the years until Gould's sudden non-linear jumps, followed by periods of little genetic change, were in fact toned down to just "speed changes" in Darwin's theory of small adaptive steps. It was no longer a revolution in evolution by Gould.  This Dennett book is far ranging and covers many topics in genetics and evolution. It is 18 chapters long and covers the subjects in a chatty style. The book is not a quick read and would take about a week to read, on and off 3 or 4 hours per day. I read about a quarter in my first read and got excited when I got to pages 156 through 163. Here starting on page 156 he describes how the first molecules or structures of life were formed. He tells us about a possibly of a replicating parasitic macromolecule, or a type of partial or pre-virus. It is likely, or at least possible, that first life was based on fragments of proteins and RNA being attracted to silica surfaces or similar. It is all very interesting, especially the idea that catalysts might have increased the mathematical probabilities of interaction to produce life, and that it is based on just common inorganic molecules found in the silica rich clays of earth's streams and lakes. He has numerous other topics such as the tree of life, ideas about the species, Mendel, "the computer that learned to play checkers", so on and so forth.  I would like thank fellow reviewer Stephen A. Haines ("bigbunyip" - or see my profile page and go to Amazon friends) for bringing this book to my attention. I highly recommend this exceptional book. Here are some other sophisticated science books for the general reader: Genome (1999) by Matt Ridley, The Fabric of The Cosmos (2004) a physics book by Briane Greene, and Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth (2003) by Andrew H. Knoll, and for a light treatment of genetics and society read: The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins (1989 version updated from 1976), or the original book: The Origin of The Species, Charles Darwin, Modern Library (original 1859, reprinted 1993) 
 another great book from Joan Aiken.  Wonderfully strong female lead and interesting alternative history 
 This is one of the few Star Trek novels that was incredibly true to the spirit of both Roddenberry and the characters, while creating a situation where the reader can experience an old character in a new way. The chance to see Spock without his fear of getting too close to humans while still being intrinsicly himself really added new layers to the character without changing Spock at all. Of course, Barbara Hambly is an amazingly talented writer and almost everything she writes is fabulous in my book 
 This is a hugely subjective autobiography, penned by one of the most legendary playwright/lyricist/ composer/ entertainer  combinations of the last century.   For scholars and devotees of Coward's life experiences and his wittly elegant use of vocabulary and phraseology: it is highly valuable.  Also of note are Coward's individualistic, personal turn of phrase and the inclusion of persnal habits and mannerisms of daily living: writing, sitting down to tea, fashion, dressing,social graces and vast friendships.  To find more of the legendary playwright's private life and what exactly inspired him to write, other objective biographies need to be consulted 
 It certainly broadens one's knowledge and appreciation to study the physical dances that so much of Bach's instrumental music was based on. But there's a difference between music written to literally  accompany dance and music stylized in the form of dances, meant primarily for listening. Bach did not play Saturday night dance gigs in Leipsig nor did Chopin play his waltzes in Parisian ballrooms. Tempos (and flexibility within those tempos) need not be based on realistic assumptions of how people may have actually danced bourees and minuets. There were enough differences in style among Italian, French and German strains of late Baroque music (and dance) that one should be cautious about any definitive rules here. That being said, the book is well written, illustrated and an interesting read 
 I was able to find this item through Amazon, after I had not had any luck finding it in my local department stores.  The delivery was quick and the shoes were great 
 This book is very good about giving ideas on what to teach from the beginning ballet technique up to advanced levels.  From the ideas one can formulate a class and know that it follows a syllabus and will develop the student appropriately. It is a good book to use as a guide and I recommend it for that 
 I bought this CD on a whim and was immediately floored by the presentation and quality of composition. This is a live album recorded at the Montreux Festival. It possesses a tremendous audio soundstage putting you right there in the audience for the event. Sweet! The New Tango is infused with a light jazz fusion which is new and joyful while remaining true in theme to its Latin roots.   Piazzolla and Burton immediately create the exotic fluid mood of this CD with their intro piece "Milonga is Coming." This is a CD for pure musical enjoyment and not dancing. Don't let the other reviewers looking for background Tango music confuse the issue. This music is a fusion of Tango and Jazz yielding a sumptuous and thickly romantic sound coupled with an equally irresistable jazz heartbeat. Burton's Vibes provide accenting on and off tempo syncopation that really sends the music into motion. I could not help but be lifted and carried along with the fresh tropical sounds "The New Tango" provides. 
 It's nice to be hearing how a physicist places chaos theory in its place amongst possible explanations for natural phenomena.  He doesn't oversell chaos, and doesn't undersell it.  Not too big a tome -- a good read 
 OOOO spooky, well not really but it is funny 
 I think that this book is very useful to anybody who really knows the BASIC of VBA in Excel.  Is the best way to begin 
 A MUST!!!! I am a Pediatrician, I've got a whole library of parenting books.  This is the best one I have read and I recommend it to all parents of 2-6 year olds.  I have had a lot of great feedback that the book has really helped so many of my families.  I have got two of my own small children and have found the book a lifesaver.  It is very common sense advice!  Very easy to read.  Sal Severe helps you to realize the things you are ALREADY doing that are helping you and your child...also makes you realize how you might be inadvertently making your child's behavior worse.  I love his list of positive things to say when you can't think  of anything positive to say.  He uses the principles of positive and  negative reinforcement throughout his book.  Tell your friends about this book 
 Ms. Caplan makes a dry and murky subject meaningful and crystal clear.  Her syntax is terse.  She gets right to the point of demistifying accounting concepts and terms. Finance and Accounting empowers the small  business owner to know enough about the financial side to recognize where  the business is and where it can go 
 What I really liked about this book was the very irreverent tone which did not take away one bit from the scientific rigor of the presentation. The authors have a sense of humor and a genuine passion for their subject and  it shows. I also liked the fact that in order to present the history of the  Pluto/Charon system the book had to explain the latest hot-off-the-presses  revolution in our understanding of the evolution of the Solar System. This  was the first time I have been exposed to the idea of massive planets  cleaning out all the early system planetisimals and the implications for  the formation of the Kuiper Belt and other solar systems. It's rare to find  a serious science book which is hard to put down, but this is it. Great  exposition, great story, great book 
 Directed by Mike Nichols, the screenplay of this film was adapted by Tony Kutchner from his play. To say that it revolves around a gay man who is suffering with AIDS, while true, does not give a fair idea of its content. The man does indeed encouter an angel, played by Emma Thompson. Also in the drama is Roy Cohn, himself dying of AIDS, and haunted by hallucinations in which Emma Rosenberg, the "convicted atomic spy", appears to him. The cast of this imaginative drama includes Emma Thompson, Meryl Streep, Jeffery Wright, and Al Pacino playing Roy Cohn. Each of these actors plays multiple roles. The entire cast is outstanding. The film treats Kutchner's play with great flair and visual imagination. It is a quite gripping and believable work of imagination, in a style that might perhaps be best described as "magical realism"; and it is very well realized. In two parts, it is well worth the four hours or so spent watching it 
 Having read other books on Geocaching, this is by far the best one.  It is concise and writen in such a fashion as to be easy reading for anyone who is interested in Geocaching.  I would highly recommend it 
 This book keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.  As good writers do there are twists and turns, which makes it all the more exciting.  It has it all: innocent man in prison for 25 yrs, behind the scenes of the Supreme court, inner workings of an ex-cop's mind, they are all there plus more.  This is a book you will not be able to put down 
 First of all I'm not really a religious guy and dont listen to gospel music but one day I got an email from a friend saying a guy is giving away a free mixtape just send him your address so I did!! And what came in the mail was easily the best mixtape I've EVER heard and I've heard alot of them!!!!! This dude lyrically a MONSTER easily one of the  best rappers ALIVE!! and all through this mixtape he's plugging his album "Born Again...Aug 23rd, Born Again ...Aug 23rd" at least 50 times so when Aug 23rd came I was brainwashed and bought it and if one word could describe it  it would have to be  AMAZING!!!    First of all there are 17 songs on this cd which could either be a good thing or a bad thing fortunatly in this case it a good thing.   The first song Bout Time sets the stage for what this dude is all about being unique and different he spits silky smooth while the hook is rough as sandpaper this joint was crazy.  Brought Me From is kinda like a autobiography of his childhood growing up in a dopehouse he paints pictures with his lyrics that would make Van Gough proud, you feel like you are right there with him, the track sounds like something out of a movie ...SICK  Dime was a song that really stuck out to me I could relate to it not really on a spiritual level but it basically talks about making the same mistakes over and over again something I do alot :(  It dont matter...If youve ever seen the movie Passion of Christ this is the closest thing you'll get to it in song form he talks about the dying and death and how he doesnt fear it because he knows what lies ahead for him it makes you think a line from here that stuck out was:  Take me to the highest oak tree In the entire country  on my neck put the noose and when it snaps dont cut me loose  leave me up there and spread the word let my dead body feed the birds  ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  His voice is very unique its not deep not high but a nice balance and makes you want to listen.  Like I said there are 17 songs on here I cant review them all but my favorites are:   Automatic - club banger material  Switch - club banger material  I Dont Love You - a HILARIOUS song featuring Satan himself classic!!  These Eyes- this joint can make you cry its so vivid and touching yet raw and grimey  Dear Cuz- a letter to his cousin in jail telling him how he's changed you GOTTA hear this for yourself!!  Better Place -My Son LOVES this song I guess because it features kids on it (I must admit its kinda catchy after the 4th time hearing it)   BUT   The icing on the cake has to be  In My Shoes it has a dude doing poetry and then when Knine comes on if you dont get chills by the time he's done check your pulse please.  This is the BEST album I've heard this year and I have them all pretty much, I'm thinking Kanye will soon join him or maybe pass him next week but it wont be easy. The cd has christian themes yet it feels like you are listening to something RAW and STREET at the same time and he does it with no cussin AT ALL which meant my son could listen to it in the car with me, I love this album its was a very pleasant surprise its a MUST for every hip hop collection! 
 This is still the Bluegrass Banjo CD by which all great Bluegrass Banjo is judged. It probably always will be. This CD is one of the reasons I fell in love with the hard driving sound of bluegrass banjo. Scruggs invented the 3 finger style and his mastery has never been equaled. In my humble opinion, this is the best single snapshot of Scruggs Style banjo ever recorded. Although it's a short CD, if you love bluegrass banjo, you will never grow weary of listening to this one. All songs are performed without lyrics and all are performed 3 finger style.  If you own only 1 banjo CD, this is the one to own 
 This was such a fun book to read, since it is fast-paced and always leaves me wondering what was going to come up next. It has just the right mixture of all the perfect teen elements: romance, family, travel, and a likeable narrator. While it was hard to understand at times, because Maureen Johnson seems to jump from place to place pretty quickly, and the narrator's thoughts aren't really made clear, I still enjoyed this book very much, and I think that any other teenager will like it too 
 This is the most amazing book!  In a world where so many people rely on material possessions to make them happy, this book displays that happiness is in your heart and not in dollars and possessions.  A person doesn't need to have the most "things" or live in the biggest house or have the most expensive car to be happy.  One needs to be comfortable and at peace with themself to be happy. I have to say this is my most favorite children's book.  I have purchased it for our school library and given it for many gifts.  It is one to keep for a lifetime 
 True to the title, this book is full of everyday recipes. I'm not as strict a vegetarian as the book advocates, but I do like to eat light and still enjoy food. Many of the recipes in this book are so easy and speedy, I keep coming back to them for quick weeknight dinners. We like the Haystacks and the no-fat hummus, both a 15-minute deal. I also liked his suggestions for roasting vegetables for sauces instead of sauteing. It adds a nice depth of flavor without fat. This is not a complicated cookbook, but it is very tasty. It definitely fits into a busy person's long-range plan for eating healthfully 
 Book was in condition described but took awhile to arrive.  Within time limits- but on the later side 
 illuminating snippets of illusion-crushing philosophies from an author who culled stinging insights from the depths of insomnia. I thought of the character in The Machinist with a precocious mind and a burning desire to tell it like it is.  This work fits well with the chilling and edifying works of Nietzsche and Dr. Christopher Hyatt.  This is not light reading. This stuff majorly spices up your palette in case you have been lulled to sleep by the "Nicholas Sparks and Oprah" dumbing down milieu and its effects on you. This is the turbo anti-dote to all the fluffy new age lite stuff floating through the air. This man, like Burroughs and others, managed to live a long and fruitful life despite raging against the machine of existence for so many years.  What an accomplishment.  
 I thought that this book was moving. It was not the conventinal moving but a more enlightening one.  The depth and the detail that the auther goes in to are so rare to find that it is in deed a tribute to a classic.  I have  loved the Nutcracker sence I was a baby and this book brought it in to a  whole new light. It was simply wonderful 
 The best movie made, and the same can be said for the soundtrack.. Just magnificent! 
 This book gave me a much better understanding of Watergate and what went on behind the scenes.  Gave me a greater respect for the FBI - but I doubt that it is now what it was then.    This book did not sugar coat Felt.  He devoted his life to the FBI at the expense of neglecting his wife and children. However, he had such a drive and tenacity to fulfill his dream that his wife would most likely not have been happy with a husband who doted on her and gave up his dream.  His life was full and meaningful - he truly got to live his dream.  The book gives the facts and leaves one wondering if some of the things Felt done were truly out of concern and his desire for justice to prevail; or if he was acting out of disappointment because he didn't get the position he so wanted. It was always passed on to someone else who was certainly not deserving or capable - a political choice to promote the promoter.  Of course, this would be a debatable subject.  I come to the conclusion though that Felt was hurt and disappointed, but that he was a man of honor and did what he felt must be done to stop the corruption and protect the people.  This book portrays an excellent picture of the great FBI leader, J Edgar Hoover. In fact, I received as much insight and knowledge about Hoover as I ddi about Felt and that was sort of an extra.  We see that Hoover was like Felt, totally dedicated to his career and demanded the same from his agents.  I feel the information in this book is something that can be relied on coming from someone like Felt.  I don't believe he would lie about anything that was in this book.    The things revealed about Martin Luther King, Jr. were important to me.  We have heard many rumours, but considering the great opposition Dr. King went though, one always wonders if there is any truth.  However, I feel now that Dr. King certainly did have sexual weaknesses that we have heard about and he did associate with the communist leaders. However, the book portrays it in an open way.  Just because he was friends with them does not mean he was for the communist movement. Through reading this book, I feel he was searching for a better way of life for his people; the socialistic way is so appealing because it claims to make the common people equal. It lures and gives a false hope. This makes me even more appreciate America, though not perfect, we still have hope.  But oh how we need good leadership to make it possible.  This book really makes you stop and think about some impportant issues of that time and of our time now.  An eye opener if you read  between the lines.  I think this book portrays Mr. Felt as unbiased, he was concerned about all people, justice for all.  He tried to be fair and compassionate as portrayed early on in the book where he let the guilty wife stay with her small children as he took the husband in for robbery.  This is really an insight to his inner character and I think this stayed with him through his career and life.  I think the book could have flowed a little better, at times it was hard to follow.  But perhaps covering so much diversity, this was the only way.  I still give it a 5, a good read 
 You will probably want some prior programming experience to make the first 5 chapters easier to digest. I'm a seasoned C/C++ programmer, and I was able to learn C# quickly with the help of this book (although admittedly C# is very much like C++). I knew a little about DirectX, but even if I didn't this book did a great job of starting basic and building on that foundation. What I like most about this book is the author goes step by step through a simple framework which gets Direct3D up and running. In about 150 lines of code, the author manages to make a Direct3D Windows application that does something. For Windows and Direct3D this is no small accomplishment given their complexity. Other books I have seen stick the Direct3D initialization into a helper library and never bother to explain it. Not here. Each line is explained well. This book will not, however, teach you advanced Direct3D topics. Only 1 chapter describes Direct3D, but it does a good job. You will want to get another book after this one to learn more advanced topics.  If you know nothing about C# or DirectX, but have some programming experience, this book is for you. The title is very fitting of the contents. Highly recommended 
 Fabulous 'how to' book.  Useful for people working on their own personal histories or for people collecting or faciliating the oral histories of others.   Well and clearly written, humorous and honest.  Examines details of issues and the approaches for resolving them.  Written before computers were everywhere and so revision discussions are no longer very relevant but everything else is. Useful for people working on their own personal histories or for people collecting or faciliating the oral histories of others.   Willa rocks 
 Although I like the book, nothing can compare to the original.  Read Psycho-Cybernetics by Maltz or the revised version by Kennedy first.  I read both versions and you can't go wrong with either one.  Then if you're serious about implementing the ideas/methods of Psycho-Cybernetics in your life, read Psycho-Cybernetics 2000.  This book has numerous examples of how people use the ideas and methods of Psycho-Cybernetics to overcome hardships/trials and tribulations in their lives.  There are also helpful techniques in this book that are not mentioned in the other versions.  Great book!            
 TV is filled with procedurals of all types and covering ever genre one can imagine, from medicine to homicide. When it first debuted, Without a Trace was something of an unknown. The premise of a team of FBI agents search for missing people in the NYC area was excellent, but could the show beat the expectations that is wasn't another CSI clone? One viewing of the first episode and I knew this was something very different.  Anthony LaPaglia as Jack Malone is one of the most intelligent casting choices in the past 5 years. He brings a charm, gravitas, and emotion to the character that feels authentic. Poppy Montgomery does a very nice job as Agent Samantha Spade, with solid supporting work from Marianne Jeanne-Baptiste, Enrique Murciano, Eric Close. As an ensemble, this is one of the best currently on television. Plot wise, this show is also one of the most interesting. The stories are well thought out, and thankfully stay away from the Law and Order type "ripped from the headlines". Each search for a missing person is done in a way the keeps the watcher intrigued until the very end, and refreshingly for a procedural, the good guys don't always win. The missing are often found dead or never found at all, which is sadly how it is in real life.  The Season Two DVD set contains twenty-four full length episodes, mastered in dolby surround and presented in widescreen. Don't expect too much as far as featurettes or commentaries go, the first season was pretty bare bones, and CBS is likely refraining from spending too much money on this box set until it can be shown to be profitable. Clearly the current run of Without a Trace on USA is having an impact on ratings and viewership, and that is likely the big reason behind this release two and one half years after season 1. So pick it up on March 13, and show them this show deserves more releases. Highly Recommended.  A.G. Corwin St.Louis, MO    
 The absense of My Wave...I don't get it, it was a pretty big radio hit off the Superunknown album, as well as on MTV.  This is a great CD, but I would have dropped get off the snake or ty cobb in favor of My Wave.   Other than the absense of My Wave, every big hit from Badmotorfinger thru Down on the Upside is on here as well as a few early songs 
 Working in the field of alcohol abuse and prevetion for over ten years, I consider this a valuable reference in my library.  Kinney and Leaton explain concepts in easy to understand terms while not skimping on  necessary details.  There are often comic drawings in the margins which  humorously go to the heart of the topic; instead of belittling the topics,  these drawings serve to bring the topics to life.  Currently working as a  trainer, I find myself often going back to this book for reminders and  clarifications 
 Before I read this book I was convinced that no one else in the world felt like I did, which was unhappy and afraid. However after hearing the stories of girls whose lives were much more horrible than mine,I began to realize that things were not so bad and started to heal. Every mother or grandmother should give this book to her daughter 
 One of the tracks from Opalescent was included on a new age sampler CD attached to the front of Nature and Health magazine, which is where I first heard it. The more I listened to the track, the more I wanted the album, but trying to locate Opalescent in Australia was quite difficult. Luckily I managed to find it - finally! - and it has proved to be the best purchase I've ever made, music-wise. This guy is phenomenal, especially considering his age (21). My music collection includes a huge amount of Vangelis, Jarre, Tangerine Dream and most of the heavies of chillout, electronic and ambient music, but I think I wound up listening to tracks from Opalescent at least once or twice a day for literally months - more than anything I've ever owned. Hopkins' music is utterly mesmerizing. It creates an ambient atmosphere unlike anything I've ever heard before. Everything flows together. This will sound cliched, but if you only ever buy one chillout album, let this one be it. I cannot recommend it highly enough, it is one of those one-in-a-million perennially listenable albums that I'm sure I will never tire of 
 Sixteen-year-old Norah Bloom has always been a trendy, Brooklyn hipster with a love of books - especially scandalous romance novels. However, Norah has been unlucky in love from day one, and has yet to even kiss a boy; whereas her thirteen-year-old sister, Stacey, has been fending off boys with a stick for years. When Norah finds out that she's short on extracurriculars, and may have a problem getting into the college of her dreams, she decides to start a book group. A high school book group at a quaint indie bookstore, with a drool-worthy guy manning the coffee counter. Norah is expecting a bunch of nerds to show up, but is quite surprised that a few of her new book loving buddies are...hotties! The hottest being shy James, a modern day Jane Austen character. But Norah has a problem...how to snag the guy of her dreams. Being the literary lover she is, Norah devises a secret plan - with the help of one of her favorite romance authors - to catch the guy, and make nice with her own little happily ever after tale.  I guess you could say that I judged this book prematurely, based on the cover - which is utterly adorable. However, as an avid reader, I loved the idea of a teenage girl starting a book group and meeting the guy of her dreams, which is why this book will stick with me for years to come. Aimee Friedman's snazzy dialogue, and name-dropping of indie bands reeks of fabulosity to me, and the characters she created each possessed their own quirks, that make each and every one of them rememberable. Norah is a wonderful heroine whose love of literature - and James - will make her appealing to all teenage girls - especially the bookworms - who dream of meeting a guy who shares the same interests as them. Like reading a note from your book-loving best friend!  Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
 I mean... 10 usbs, sli, 6 SATAs, support for up to 13 GB of RAM and theorethically more. Too much 
 This book is our standard as we begin to build the team concept.  The quote, "If teams are the Religion, then this is the Bible" comes from a senior manager in our company who has PASSION for the team concept.  I am an internal OD consultant and I have a healthy background in the  development of self directed teams.  I used to consider "Self Directed  Work Teams, the New American Challenge" by Orsburn, Moran, Musselwhite  and Zenger to be the standard.  Since then I have read a lot of works on  the concept of self directed teams, and this Fisher book is a great book,  at the top of the heap.  Reason?  Because as a practitioner you can USE it 
 Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called "Burning CD's for Dummies", it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you 
 Again, Cannell does not disappoint.  He writes a fast-paced enjoyable book with plenty of twists.  He really is a master storyteller.  His style is grittier than Nelson DeMille but he weaves his plots in a similar way.  The sexual tension between the two main characters was a bit to formulaic but it doesn't detract from a very enjoyable read and an interesting, if not frightening insight into Asian crime rings.  If you have a rodent phobia, beware 
 We've all seen Far Side cartoons, stuck on office doors and cubicle walls, and said, "I don't get it."  Then we've learned a little and come back, this time laughing raucously.  This book is filled with all sorts of Far Side gems, most of which any average yutz can find hilarious.  If you like the Far Side, or if you just like a glimpse at that which is odd, warped, and mind-bending (or, in other terms, Larsonesque), you should have this book 
 So much has already been written about Catch 22 that I don't know if I can add anything else to the discussion.  It's well worth your time to read it if you haven't and reread it if it's been a while.   The brilliance of the book, in my opinion, is that it maintains several themes strongly through sarcasm.  Reading the novel feels like watching a M*A*S*H marathon, that's high praise in my book.   Power designs itself to remain in power and greed is the ultimate excuse for any crime.  Those out of power can be trampled upon and abused and killed so long as it's done in the name of greed - and that doesn't even need to be disguised.  And, the sad part is that it's all true.  There isn't any truth in this book that's less relevant today than when it was written 40 years ago.   - CV Ric 
 This small book is still the most helpful tool for those who wish accurate information about the physical and psychological aspects of alcoholism.  The disease of alcoholism is still misunderstood and to many people remains a moral problem or a failure of will power.  While there has been progress in the treatment of many diseases over the past 20 years, there has been little change in the outlook for a cure for alcoholism. This book explains the physical and psychological disease in a way that can be easily understood.  I have used this book for 22 years and have provided it to persons who wish to recover from the disease, always to good effect.  And I am so grateful that it continues to be in print 
 Mr. Rove has said that Mr. Ledeen is his greatest policy influence.  For that reason alone you should read this book and find out what these psychos believe.  Or if you'd rather not, the message can be simplified to this..."The world will be safe from terrorism if we destroy it." While the truth and logic of that statement is hard to deny, somehow I cannot accept it as a morally sane argument 
 I loved this. We had to drive to california from washington. And this helped me so much, she loved it, the pillows on the side made her feel like i was there next to her, the nightlight was even a nice touch because I could wake up and see what she needed quicker. it was easy to pack up and carry.I thank goodness I purchased this 
 Ohh dear this album is simply so great that I find it difficult to understand that I first got my hands on it in 2006. It contains everything good about Pearl Jam, great lyrics, talented music, high energy and powerfull rock ballads. This album is mostly unplugged and the depth of the band really shows on songs like: "Fatal", "Immortality", and "Off He Goes". The semi electric songs are arguably even better. The versions of "Daughter", "Black", "Crazy Mary", "Nothing As It Seems" and "All Or None" are each easily worth the prize of the album by them self.   A parade of great instrumental and electric songs - I wished I had been there at the concert because it must have been a night to remember 
 Randy Newman is an America original. He is one of our greatest singer-songwriters, whose trenchant humor, biting social satire, eclectic compositions and intelligent lyrics have set him far above the pack for decades. Musically adept and diverse in style, Newman has dozens of albums and hundreds of songs in his discography. He has composed movie scores including "Ragtime," "The Natural," "Parenthood," "Awakenings," "Toy Story," and "Pleasantville." His work in the film industry earned him 16 Oscar nominations including his first win for "If I Didn't Have You" from the film "Monsters, Inc."  "Sail Away" is one of my favorite Newman albums (1972), and one of his first. The title song is most powerful. Backed by a full orchestra, the track's wonderfully gentle melody provides a dark contrast to the disquieting voice of a slave trader convincing Africans of the bounty America has to offer. "Ain't no lions or tigers - Ain't no mamba snake/Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake/Ev'rybody is as happy as a man can be/Climb aboard little wog -Sail away with me." Yep! "It's great to be an American!" In the same vein, "Political Science's" casually genocidal American leader has ambitions of making major changes in the world. "Boom goes London and boom Paree/More room for you and more room for me/And every city the whole world round/Will just be an American town." 1972??? The more things change the more they stay the same.   Newman wrote the sardonic "Lonely at the Top," for Frank Sinatra. "Listen all you fools out there/Go on and love me--I don't care/Oh, it's lonely at the top." He thought Sinatra would love it. Old Blue Eyes did not. So Newman recorded it himself.   The terribly poignant "Old Man" never fails to move me. And the bitter, ironic "God's Song," makes some pithy statements about organized religion. "Memo to My Son" is a paean  to parents everywhere  - or perhaps the empathy here is for the kids. "Burn On," reminds me of the time Cleveland's Cuyahoga River caught fire. Seriously, I was there. Talk about water pollution! You Can Leave Your Hat On" is a mid-tempo erotic rock song that later became a hit for Joe Cocker.    "Sail Away" is an impressively even album. The music is simply wonderful. And the remastered reissue has an additional 5 bonus tracks. If you're a Randy Newman fan, you can't go wrong with this one. JAN 
 As an avid reader of Dostoevsky, this book was that which inspired me to pursue him completely, this book is widely recognized as one of his two masterworks (the other being The Brothers Karamazov). His philosophy is simply splendid, the plot is perfect. I believe that this is not a book which you can read just once and fully understand all the nuances of the philosophy. You cannot read this book without full concentration either.  Simply put, this book is an essential (truly) to any reader, or to anyone remotely interested in philosophy 
 I have over 50 books about mosaics and this is by far my favorite.  It covers many different styles and the instructions are clearly written and very easy to follow. Sonia King is known throughout the mosaic community as an expert and this book is a great showcase of her vast knowledge. A MUST HAVE for beginners and veteran mosaicists alike 
 At long last Flower Drum Song is being released on DVD. I wore out the VHS years ago. Juanita Hall delivers great one-liners just as she did in South Pacific.(Bloody Mary) Her interaction with Master Wang (Her brother in law) is hilarious! "You sit there idling while I must find a bride for your oldest son!'  , "How many times have I told you, you should keep your money in a bank!" , "You are not a feudal lord, This is not China!"  The songs and orchestrations are outstanding. Fan-Tan Fanny is a great showstopper.   No doubt the political correctness police are in a cold sweat over this being released but who cares?  (When the show was restaged on Broadway a few years ago a few songs were dropped and the script completely rewritten.)   This is a 5 star musical!   
 The Bee Gees started the second phase of their extraordinary careers with 1975s stellar "Jive Talkin'" (#1 for 2 weeks in 1975) a song that heralded the beginning of their rule as disco masters.  They continued their ascent with the equally danceable "You Should Be Dancing" (#1 for 1 week in 1976) and peaked a few years later with their trio of #1 hits from "Saturday Night Fever" - "How Deep Is Your Love" (#1 for 3 weeks in 1977), "Stayin' Alive" (#1 for 4 weeks in 1978), and "Night Fever" (#1 for 8 weeks in 1978).  The brothers managed to stay on top of the music world with their next CD, "Spirits Having Flown," which yielded 3 more #1 hits - "Too Much Heaven" (#1 for 2 weeks in 1979), "Tragedy" (#1 for 2 weeks in 1979), and "Love You Inside Out" (#1 for 1 week in 1979).  "Greatest" was released in 1979, on the heels of this phenomenal late 70s success.  In addition to these great #1 songs, the set includes their two other Top 10s from the period - "Nights on Broadway" (#7 in 1975) and "Love So Right" (#3 in 1976).  One of my favorite songs here is "Fanny (Be Tender with My Love)" which only went to #12 in 1976 but is a beautiful ballad worthy of greater attention.  The Bee Gees were so huge at the time that they even managed to score a hit on the country chart: "Rest Your Love on Me," the b-side of "Too Much Heaven," peaked at #39 in 1979.  I also really enjoy the non-hits, some of which were singles for others.  "(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away," for example, peaked at #9 in 1978 for their brother, Andy Gibb.  In addition, two other songs from "Saturday Night Fever" are included: "If I Can't Have You" (#1 for 1 week in 1978 for Yvonne Elliman) and "More Than a Woman" (#32 in 1978 for Tavares).  I particularly like "If I Can't Have You": their version adds some fantastic urgency to the lyrics - a really great song.  Finally, some top-notch album cuts are here: "Love Me," "You Stepped Into My Life," and "Children of the World" (from 1976's "Children of the World"); "Spirits (Having Flown)" (from 1979's "Spirits Having Flown"); "Wind of Change (from 1975's "Main Course").  I'm really surprised that "Love Me" was never released as a single, as it sounds like a sure-fire hit.  I really love "Greatest," and the Bee Gees have been enjoying a critical and popular rediscovery in recent years; they were even inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.  This collection, however, has gone out of print and been replaced by the subsequent "The Bee Gees - Their Greatest Hits: The Record," a 2-disc set with 40 songs.  That collection comprises hits from their entire career, from "New York Mining Disaster" (#14 in 1967) to "Alone" (#28 in 1997).  However, "Greatest" is much more focused on their disco era success and thus sounds very cohesive.       
 Great for beginners to intermediate users. Clear instructions, great color graphics, simple but fundamental instructions,  powerful in its simplicity. Mouth-wateringly good! Grab this 
 "'Tis"..(Hardcover) A most enjoyable follow up to his childhood memoir "Angela's Ashes", Frank McCourt, in "'Tis", now lets us in on life as a poor young immigrant, trying to make his way in the jungle of NYC. Being told over and over, stick with your own kind(the Irish immigrants), Frank as is his nature, does things his own way, which don't always work out to well for him.   When we last left off in Angela's Ashes, Frank had just arrived, eager for a new life in America(the place of his birth). Nothing seems to be going right for him. He is naive in the ways of the world, and learning some hard lessons.Still plagued by bad eyes and teeth, he lands a job, cleaning up in a hotel.He sees the college students, with their movie star smiles and looks, and yearns to be among them. With the war in Korea going on, Frank gets drafted and right away gets himself into trouble by just holding to his beliefs. Stuck as a company clerk, he masters the skill of typing! Later he manages to get into college,even without a High School diploma, which really speaks to his tenacity, and after much hard work between school and jobs requiring much physical labor, he graduates and becomes a teacher. He also somehow manages to marry the most beautiful girl, the envy of all in his college days.   So now as an adult, with the responsibilities to his family and students, he makes us laugh and cry with the most wonderful funny and poignant stories of trying to learn the rules of life in New York, of being an employee, the military, a college student, a husband, and teacher.We are introduced to some new people that have affected his life in some way. He also goes back to Ireland to visit, and we are reintroduced to some of the people who shaped his early life. His mother is still very much a part of the story, and it is hard not to get emotionally involved with their relationship.   We are still treated to his refreshing style of writing, in which he lets us in on all his thoughts, and subtly pokes fun at the ways of society and the system of life. It is the tone that is different. As well it should be. In "Angela's Ashes", we saw the hardships of life through the  forgiving and eager eyes of a child. It made that book maybe just a little more special. Now the look is that of first a frustrated young man, and then a more experienced adult. There are times, you may not like what he does or says, but this is his life story, and it is honest and life affirming.  This book is also available in paperback.Enter 0006551815 into the book search and it should take you to the paperback selling site.   I'm very much looking forward to the third book of this beautiful memoir, "Teacher Man". If you loved Angela's Ashes, you will surely want to know what has become of Frankie McCourt. He will take you on more of his life's adventures,another enthralling read,and leave you smiling.....enjoy....Laurie    
 I was hesitant to try a 1X but am so glad I did. I only wish I had ordered two at the $19.90 price I got this one for. It's soft suede, a nice tailored look but not too snug. I'll continue to watch if the price goes down in order to get another color other than black 
 PAGE 141 (punctuation is as the author intended)    "...They'd ride at night up along the western mesa two hours from the ranch and sometimes he'd build a fire and they could see the gaslights at the hacienda gates far below them floating in a pool of black and sometimes the lights seemed to move as if the world down there turned on some other center and they saw stars fall to earth by the hundreds and she told him stories of her father's family and of Mexico. Going back they'd walk the horses into the lake and the horses would stand and drink with the water at their chests and the stars in the lake bobbed and tilted where they drank and if it rained in the mountains the air would be close and the night more warm and one night he left her and rode down along the edge of the lake through the sedge and willow and slid from the horses back and pulled off his boots and his clothes and walked out into the lake where the moon slid away before him and ducks gabbled out there in the dark. The water was black and warm and he turned in the lake and spread his arms in the water and the water was so dark and so silky and he watched across the still black surface to where she stood on the shore with the horse and he watched where she stepped from her pooled clothing so pale, so pale, like a chrysalis emerging, and walked into the water.     She paused midway to look back. Standing there trembling in the water and not from the cold for there was none. Do not speak to her. Do not call. When she reached him he held out his hand amd she took it. She was so pale in the lake she seemed to be burning. Like foxfire in a darkened wood. That burned cold. Like the moon that burned cold. Her black hair floating on the water about her, falling and floating on the water. She put her other arm about his shoulder and looked toward the moon in the west do not speak to her do not call and then she turned her face up to him. Sweeter for the larceny of time and flesh, sweeter for the betrayal. Nesting cranes that stood singlefooted among the cane on the south shore had pulled their slender beaks from their wingpits to watch. Me quieres? she said. Yes, he said. He said her name. God yes, he said... 
 I think the book is one of the best for resources in the AD&D gaming syste 
 Another great read my Mary Janice Davidson.  I picked it up because of the mermaid picture..then couldn't put it down because it was hilarious 
 This is a must have for musicians and fans of music alike.  It is a collection of first rate, awesome music, with great audio fidelity, pictures and liner notes. It is also a document of a little known organization, the Friends of Old Time Music, which has had a huge positive effect on American culture.  The series of concerts, presented by the FOTM, cronicled and sampled from in this box were an early and major step in introducing not just the songs themselves but the true musical styles of Southern traditional music to an urban audience in the North and to the population as a whole.  The music displays an artistry, debth of vision and advanced vocal and instrumental technique that is extraordinary.  Up until these concerts the broadly influential "folk revival" in the North had been characterized by sanitized and simplified (and some would say bastardized) versions of these Southern traditional and vernacular songs.  The concerts presented by the Friends of Old Time Music gave reality to this old-time, blues, pre-blues, carribean and bluegrass music, as played live and in person by some of its foremost artists.  This inspired a broader section of the population to develope a sensitivity to the style and really learn to play and appreciate the music.   For me, the debate that this collection of music wades into, and which the Friends of Old Time Music was wading into in the early 60's, was whether and to what extent a song can be separated from its style.  If you love this kind of music already, or are just getting into it listen for the style of the music, how it is ornamented and executed. A song cannot really be separated from its style.  For musicians: learn the style and innovate within the tradition.  You can't really get out of it anyway, might as well check it out as much as you can.  - Eli Smit 
 Rainer Maria Rilke' s exquisite stylistic sobriety and his thought's  deepness  makes of him one of the most absorbing and interesting poets of the second half of the XIX Century. His febrile style contrasts with the delicacy of his verses, loaded of penetrating vision and prolific display of visual images that conveys us with the mythic roots.   The words in Rilke's  poetic have major expression, density and expression; a strong expansiveness and excel significance.   His reading is an absolute must for any hard reader I any corner of the world.  
 This biography of lincoln is an unbiased look into the man's life.  You'll find everything you would expect and much, much, more.  This is not a book for the weak hearted reader.  Many of the sections seem to be endless.   This is not however a negative, the opposite is true.  Sandburg's quest for  a truly indepth redering of the Lincoln story creates these long spells and  the pay off is just.  Much of the humor in the book is dated and therefore  will be lost on many readers.  Once again, an outstanding book that gets an  easy 5 stars 
 "Z" was perhaps the first Foriegn film I remember really making an impression on me. Remember Martin L.King and Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated just a year or so before, so this film felt like it was real life!  Yves Montand is outstanding as the opposition candidate who is assassinated by Thuggs who inturn are protected by government conspiracy. It is on a par with any Hollywood film of it time. The sound track music is unforgetable and is a perfect match to the drama.   This release is in french with english subtitles! There is also a earlier, "above average English dub" that aired on TV and in a Laser Disc release that I would also recommend if you can find it 
 Not in that way sweet, of course. the fact that he rode a horse to her and stayed together and wont let sex come in between them. I actually want a boyfriend like that. Good movie. Eventhough it has strong sexual content in it, people ages from 14-18 would enjoy it and get the part of the story better 
 The recipes in this book are spectacular and simple (though the ingredients are a little exotic and pricey at times).  Lawson's writing style and choice of words are wonderfully mellifluous, and the book is as much a pleasure to use as a cookbook as it is to read for pure enjoyment 
 As usual, Bill Bryson is informative, witty, and brilliant in his relaying of this history of the United States. I had to dock him a star in the ratings this time out because this is billed, based on the title, as a history of the English language in America. It is more appropriately described as a brief history of America and its culture, with some occasional attention to the language. Since I bought it due to a recent interest in word origins, I was mildly (and only mildly) disappointed at the lesser degree of attention paid to etymology. However, since I've read most of Bryson's other books and can't get enough of his writing style and his no-nonsense approach to fact-finding, and since many of the stories he relates really are quite fascinating, the book is still a very welcome addition to my library 
 This is certainly one of the best Atlantis shows to date. Another one was Common Ground. 
 I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO RAHEEM DEVAUGHN FOR MAKING SUCH A DIFFERNET AND WONDERFUL ALBUM.  "THE LOVE EXPERINCE" IS DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST SOULFUL ALBUMS.  AND IF YOU EVERY GET A CHANCE TO WITNESS THIS BROTHER LIVE, GO SEE HIM!  THE LIVE SHOW IS ALL THAT 
 If you've been considering a digital full frame camera (and who hasn't?) this is the one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Now that Kodak is out of the picture, your choices are the EOS 5D or the 1DS Mark II, which costs more than twice as much.  You do have to give up a few things, such as a super-fast frame rate for continuous shooting, but the 5D has the resolution you need for top-quality images, and the ability to get true wide angle perspectives from your EF lenses.  I happened to shoot this camera at a concert side-by-side with a vendor "N" camera, both under available light with 85mm f/1.8 lenses at a range of ISOs.  I found some shots I liked from the other camera, shot at ISO 400, and comparable shots from the 5D which, to my surprise, turned out to be exposed at ISO 3200.  The 5D absolutely lives up to its low noise reputation.  But don't take my word for it, try one out for yourself 
 While the bookstores are filled with books about getting a job, I don't remember reading a book before that looks squarely at how one should approach an IT career that also includes so many practical tools as this one does.  Each chapter has questions and exercises and the enclosed CD has a number of tools, forms, spreadsheets and examples to help you apply the lessons of the book.  The book starts with the perspective of the "bust" after the Internet "boom" of the late 1990s.  IT jobs are harder to find, harder to keep and pay less.  New graduates with certifications can no longer expect to launch into high-profile career jobs.  In fact, the first job may be an apparent step backward.  Mr. Moran argues that the new graduate should look upon such situations as an opportunity to learn . . . especially about the organization, rather than just about IT.  That philosophy echoes throughout the book as he argues for IT professionals emphasizing their learning about how to make profits for the company by adding value . . . rather than just being technically up-to-date.  The advice will seem counter-intuitive so some . . . know less about more . . .  rather than more about less.    I'm not an IT professional, but I often work with these talented people and I teach many IT professionals about business.  From my perspective, the great value of the book is to round out the world view of an IT professional for the purpose of making the person more effective . . . rather than more efficient.  Nice!  At the same time, any book that aims to cover every subject from managing your attitude to networking with other professionals to telecommuting to negotiating a salary to mentoring others to managing your personal finances is bound to be many leagues wide and about an inch deep.  As a result, many of the chapters will not be very useful except to those with no experience and no one to talk to.  In the whole cover letter to on-the-job promotion section (chapters 9-16), I found myself wishing he had simply provided a list of great books on these subject and added one or two pages about what's different for IT professionals.    I liked chapters 5 (Self-Assessment), 6 (Attitude), 19 (The Move to Management), and 21 (Concept over Process) best.  The rest didn't seem to add much value compared to more focused books on those topics I have read.  Of the four strong chapters, I found 21 a trifle confusing and weighed down with a bit too much jargon for my taste.  Overall, I think this book will be of most benefit to soon-to-be-graduates and those who are stalled in their careers and aren't quite sure what to do about overcoming the stalls.  Good luck 
 Most reviewers have missed the most important dimension of this book: Jim Goad is an American prose stylist on parallel with H.L. Mencken, Florence King, and Mark Twain. What most have taken as a war cry is more properly viewed as wit.  This book is filled with hilarious metaphors, transitions, over-the-top prose and verbal darts. Those who have an ideological bone to pick with Goad, or wish to engage in rebuttal had first better check the mirror for where their self-importance and moral superiority meters are set. For Goad, arguing from below with the tools of pugnacious roustabout and the rhetorical and argumentative skills of a St. Aquinas will deploy his first haymaker quite easily: he's going to make you laugh very hard.  An uproarious Rabelaisian wonder of a book. A joy, a pleasure, a belly laugh, a bacchanal, a celebration, a hootenanny, a liberation, a nouvelle monde, a birth, a breakthrough, a backslap, a war whoop, a whimsy, a watershed, a wonder, a discovery, a delight, a treasure, a classic. Jim Goad's The REDNECK MANIFESTO: HOW HILLBILLIES HICKS AND WHITE TRASH BECAME AMERICAS SCAPEGOATS is as American as white lightening and as welcome as liberty and as classic as Menken's "The American Language." A significant and delightful contribution to American prose.  Get it today 
 This was a good book to let you know that yes, stong willed kids do exist, yes, you can make it through, no, your child is not the only one, and yes you do have to stick to your guns.  Other than that, I found little in the way of advice in HOW to manage these kids that DO exist 
 The Big Sky is the first in a series of great Western novels by A.B. Guthrie. The story begins in 1830 as young Boone Caudill escapes his Kentucky home for the plains and mountains of the west. He meets up with Jim Deakins, a pleasant country philosopher, early on his journey and finally the experienced mountain man Dick Summers on the keelboat trip up the Missouri.  I enjoyed Deakins' theological disquisitions. "You can't beat God for bein' picky. No, sir. If he catches you playin' cards or sayin' one swear word...it's to hell with you forever and ever...Even thinkin' is mighty dangerous. As a man thinketh, that's how he is, and to hell with him ag'in. Why you reckon he gave us a thinker then?...God is some busybody."  Guthrie takes us up the Missouri, a slow fight all the way, across the plains, into the mountains and back. He creates for the reader the palpable sense of the openness and wildness of the West. Yet the book steps back from fully romanticizing the end of the mountain man era. The story is often disturbing, not the least in Boone Caudill's quick and often brutal ways.  Highest recommendation for anyone interested in the American West. 
   "At some point, when you give up everything, there is nothing left to worry about."   Most carny's lives model this quote, as does Kristie's, one of the main characters who has been in this carnival tour for years. They have nothing to lose. As for Michael, also a main character, who ran away from his troubled homelife to join Kristie in the tour, he's already lost. He's hiding from a secret past only to see it resurface to face him head-on with the world now watching.   This is a great book with even better morals. I reccommend reading Nothing To Lose for adventure, mystery, romance, and a twist ending. It leaves you asking questions throughout the entire book; and thereon after 
 This is a great book! I loved the charectures, and how difined they were. Its a great story line, with a lot of suspense. The very end was confusing, and you had to read it a few times, but then it made sense. I love fantasy  books, David Eddings, JK Rowling, Kate Forsyth, and Phillip pullman  espesially. Read this book 
 This is a great collection. Unique, soothing, and addictive. I think our 5-month-old baby's favorite must be Lullaby (Take 6), because she is usually sound asleep before this one ends. I find Spirit Lullaby (Sweet Honey in the Rock) amazing. She was a really fussy newborn who didn't sleep much, but since she was 3 months we lay her in her bed, put this lullaby on, and she smiles and coos until she drifts off. Maturity gets some credit, but I think the music helps too. We interchange other lullaby CD's but this one works best 
 Let's face it, the "greatest hits" compilations of recent years (Namingly "Essential Neil Diamond" and "Greatest Hits 2CD") failed completely because they featured too many live recordings from later years.  NEIL DIAMOND GOLD was released in mid 2005 and is a very impressive collection of his songs during the MCA/Uni period.  The digital remastering is simply stunning!  The positives of this CD are:  1. The live recordings only amount to 6 tracks (out of 41 songs).  Even better news is that 4 of these live songs are from the brilliant "Hot August Night" 1972 concert, while the other two are from the 1970 concert called "Gold".  As most people are aware, the "Hot August Night" concert is one of those rare recordings where many of the songs came across better than their studio versions.  And Neil's voice was in its prime, compared to later concerts.   2. There are some interesting tracks on here which aren't found on many of his other compilations such as "Porcupine Pie, "Suzanne" and "Both Sides Now".    3. The price of this CD is excellent when compared to his other brilliant compilation "Play Me: The Complete Uni Recordings".  The negatives of this CD are:  1. While they have picked 4 tracks from the glorious "Hot August Night" CD, they have chosen not to include the live version from that concert of "Crunchy Granola Suite" - which is the better version.  This CD contains the original studio recording (which isn't as good IMO). Others will disagree and prefer to have the studio version.  2. A very noticeable omission is "I Am A Believer". If this had been included, I would have been thrilled to call this the definitive collection of the MCA years.  3. Tracks from the later part of the 1970's are not included (eg. "September Morn" "Beautiful Noise", "Forever in Blue Jeans" or "If you know what I mean") but this is because they were recorded under CBS.  Still, it would have been great to have them on here.  OVERALL SUMMARY: Neil Diamond GOLD is a welcome relief after a few inferior compilations (as named in first sentence).  The digital remastering is brilliant and crystal clear.The amazing array of songs covering the MCA period has been well compiled except for the omission of "I'm A Believer".  The live recordings have been kept to a minimum, and the majority of these are from the excellent "Hot August Night" 1972 concert, and NOT the 1990's concerts.  All Diamond fans will want this in their collection, it is a risk free purchase 
 I read this book, and I would have to say that it is one of the best tools in understanding how and why people act the way that they do.  I work with the public every day, and was at my wit's end with my customers and the way that they act.  After reading this book I have a deeper understanding of their and my inner workings and have found my work life to be more productive and less confrontational.  Great book 
 Before someone can write poetry he must learn the alphabet and some grammar rules. Before you trade forex you should read this book to make forex "poetry" by trading well. This book is a concise and clear presentation of all of the basic ideas needed to trade forex.   It seems to me that there are two kinds of people who will not enjoy this book. The first kind of person will never understand the difference between a "pip" being a trading unit of currency and the funny thing on the end of an orange! Beware of this kind of person. They should spend more time watching the food channel to pick up on new cooking techniques. The second type of person is looking for trading techniques and would do well to read the author's excellent work on charting techniques for forex trading. Take note, these men are SERIOUS traders and have the rare talent to bring complicated ideas to different levels of readers. This is a primer, nothing else. If you read this book and do not "get anything" from this then you should not be in the forex trading game. You will have learned a very inexpensive lesson. If this book makes no sense to you consider going to cooking school. However, there are thousands of newbie traders that should own and use this book. Between page 1 and page 182 is a collection of all of the basic ideas that you will need to play this amazing game of forex trading. Good trading to all. 
 I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it back in July. I still can't understand why the critics just didn't get this one. This has to be one of the best second films ever made in a Trilogy. The addition of Davy Jones was brilliant. It made the film much darker and more dramatic. Johnny Deep was superb as usual. I still can't believe that the film made $400 million dollars domestically and over $1 billion dollars worldwide. It's surreal. But everything about this movie was so on point that it's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film. I enjoyed this one more than the original. I thought the story was more interesting on this occasion. Although, you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of Geoffrey Rush's character. He and Depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him. It was a huge void to fill. But enter Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and all is well. I guess that's one reason why "Dead Man's Chest" woks the way it does. Billy Nighy gives an A-list performance. And when you add in Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, it's money in the bank. The only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original "Star Wars." Yes, I prefer "Pirates" over TLOTR. Although, perhaps my comments are premature since "At World End" hasn't even been released yet. Should that be a dud, then of course the whole thing falls apart. But here's hoping that the third time is a charmer. If you own the first "Pirates" on DVD then you have to get this. Don't miss out. 
 A must have for Blues lovers.  All the rawness of old blues, celebrating sex or the lack of it, with humor, passion and the sincerity of the true blues singer.  Fine audio quality with all the cracks and pops preserverd far behind the vocals.  Everything you'd expect from a great label 
 Being an Elijah Wood fan, I ordered this movie, as one I had not yet even heard of.  I like Kevin Costner, but have found his later movies to be rather self-absorbing and, well, Kevin Costner playing Kevin Costner - not a lot of versatility there.  This movie, although not deep on plot, did impart a senstivity and a feeling of loyalty and compassion.  The young actors imparted a vitality and, especially with Elijah Wood, the ability to play (as shown in all of his films) various diversity of methods and the ability to adapt to dialects of differing regions. A nice feel-good movie - evoked all of the emotions, but in the end, the message that good outweighs all 
 Lovely illustrations and repeating, predictable text. The illustrations are "old fashioned" looking and were drawn in ink then colored with watercolors and gouache. A classic tale about a gingerbread cookie man that gets up and runs away when he is released from the oven and leads many on a long chase. My children want me to read this story over and over again! There are many versions of this story in print but we especially like this one. As a bonus, the recipe for gingerbread cookies is on the back cover 
 It is a great book for anyone interested in sexual studies. It's interesting to anyone who likes seeing how views change through the centuries. The book is quite comprehensive and lists a good deal of sexual fetishes and deviances. While it may be a scientific book, some may find it a bit arousing to read some of the stories. Whatever you're pleasure, it's an interesting and fun book to read that's educational. You don't get that too often 
 This book opened my eyes to what is happening in America's economy like no other.  We often hear about America being the only super power left in the world, but I had never thought about the super powers that came before us, or why they had fallen.  "Wealth And Democracy" is an informative look at who the last three super powers were, their rise and their fall, all of which took identical paths, and shows how America is following the very same pattern.  Every American should read this.  We need to be aware of what is happening so that we can do something about it 
 A nicely laid out book of the essentials and some extras to introduce you to Belize and its cultures.  Maps, accomodations, history and some ecological information well formatted 
 I purchased this television at a bricks-and-mortar store, on sale, for less money than the 32" LCD screen that I was considering. I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV.  For comparison, I am moving from a 26" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great.  My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault.  I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200.  My last "pro" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet. I can scoot this TV on my stand without scratching the wood surface, and when trying to center a TV which is nearly 40" wide across the front, that's a good thing 
 This cd is allsome. I love to get a cd an it has more than one of to good songs on it. Most of the songs on here are the bomb. I was in grade school when most of these songs came out and those was some good times 
 This book was very well written, it contains bits and pieces of journalistic facts while using the lives of ordinary people to show the impact of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in a compassionate and perceptive voice. John Hersey uses facts and the recollections of those who survived to weave a truely remarkable tale of what happens when one decision changes the lives of many. This novel contains bits and pieces of people's lives before and after the atomic bomb had been dropped. Although the book may seem short, the time that you spend thinking about the book is actually quite long. This book is not a light and happy read, it is not some classic that becomes cliqued and quoted all too many times, but what it is is an admirable tale spun not by the author himself, but by the lives of those who managed to do the near impossible. This novel tells the story of those who managed to live 
 This is a gorgeous book with BIG pictures which help in precisely identifying a found fungus. With the current wet, hot summer we've been having, mushrooms have been popping up overnight for weeks, and this book has been instrumental in letting us zero in on what we are seeing. Highly recommend 
 This is a very good cologne  Cologne is not suppose to be overbearing ...... FOOL  because after 15 minutes your sense of smell is dulled by it but EVERYONE can stilll smell it  Trust me I got several phone numbers from this and scored as well  To the one who is gripping ..you must be Beavis or Butthead 
  One of the best films about the lives of a Grunt in the Viet Nam War that I have seen. Better than "Platoon" and almost up there with "Once We Were Soldiers". It shows one of the most horrific fights of the war the most aptly named "Hamburger Hill". Why we fought there and how is never really explained but the basic goodness and toughness of our troops has never been showed so well as it was here. Good to go in my book! 
 Whether you're Greek - or whatever - just about anyone can relate to Toula's life. After having deemed herself hopeless for thirty-odd years, then finally meeting the man of her dreams, Toula's real obstacle is surving her family! While his parents are quiet and typical Americans, Toula's clan embraces their roots -- telling strangers the intimate details of their medical histories, roasting a lamb in the front yard, Gramma in the old-country babushka. You'll laugh til you cry, 'cause chances are, you know someone exactly like each of Toula's relatives.. 
 I really enjoyed this book. It's inspiring, full of good exercises and has been of great help to me. However, I recently came across Dorothea Brande's 1934 classic 'Becoming a Writer', which somewhat tainted 'The Right to Write' for me. Ms Cameron credits Dorothea Brande's book in the bibliography, but appears to claim the 'morning pages' idea as her own - it is 'the most effective tool I have devised' or words to that effect. In fact, the idea of morning pages is lifted straight from 'Becoming a Writer' and no mention is made of this in the book. I think it's important for fans of Julia Cameron to know this 
 Although I'm not an expert and therefore cannot comment on whether this really is a complete manual, I can say that the book is very good. It's full of helpful examples (nicely placed in the margins) that help the reader develop good typographical intuitions. It is extremely accessible, even for a non-specialist, and from all that I can tell, it is quite comprehensive 
 This book is extremely accessable and discusses horror in film in a profound way with considerable scope.  Anyone who responds keenly to the supernatural in literature and film is bound to enjoy these in depth discussions of many of the finest horror films we have.  The author is upfront about her approach, and about her own likes and dislikes, but these admissions do not limit the book in any way.  There is much to learn here, much to ponder.  For an author like me who believes that horror fiction and film reflect our deepest social and psychological concerns, this book has tremendous value. I am looking for more books by the author. 
 I'm frankly interested in natural disasters such as tornados, floods, and hurricanes. I find it fascinating how the human spirit can remain strong despite an environment which might at any time become deadly. "Our Final Hour" contains a scientists warnings about spectacular disasters we as human beings might one day have to face, and what if anything can be done to prevent/overcome these unforseen disasters. From flooding, to terrorist threat, this book plays out many scenarios with stunning and interesting outcomes.  This book is not light reading and might take a while to plow through, but I enjoyed every minute. Its interesting stuff, and while I'm not particularly worried about these sort of cataclysmic events included in this book,  its nice to be prepared- and it makes good fodder for science fiction writing.   5 stars.  
 This is some great surf music here.  No throwaway tunes.  The latter half starts to sound a little more rockabilly, but never loses it's surf sound.  Don't expect fast, uppity tunes, the songs are mid paced to slower, but don't let that discourage you.  It's all very catchy and great for kicking back to.  A gambleless purchase 
 Now that George Lucas has completed Episodes I, II, and III of the "Star Wars" saga, it is time to take a moment and put together all of the pieces into a comprehensive chronology that account for everything in the "Star Wars" universe from the Pre-Republic Era to the Killik Expansion (so the chronology goes 35-36 years beyond the end of the original "Star Wars" movie).  The six movies are at the heart of everything, but there are all those novels, comic books, and graphic novels, not to mention references to historical events that can be fleshed out.  Putting everything in order is what "Star Wars: The New Essential Chronology" is all about.  With text by Daniel Wallace, with Kevin J. Anderson, this "new" version is updated for "The Phantom Menace," "Attack of the Clones," "Revenge of the Sith," and the new Jedi order.  It also has dozens of full-color illustrations by Mark Chiarello, Tommy Lee Edwards, and John Van Fleet, who distinct styles certainly complement each other.    Ever since the hologram of Princess Leia named Obi-Wan Kenobi as her only hope and mentioned the Clone Wars fans of "Star Wars" have been trying to expand their knowledge of that galaxy far, far away in a time long ago.  The history of the "Star Wars" universe is divided into a dozen parts: (1) Tales of the Ancient Republic; (2) The Fall of the Republic, which includes films I-III; (3) The Empire and the New Order; (4) Profiles in History of Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and the Skywalkers; (5) The Galactic Civil War, which covers the original trilogy; (6) Birth of the New Republic; (7) Empire Resurgent; (8) The Return of the Jedi Knights; (9) Uprisings and Insurgencies; (10) A Lasting Peace; (11) Generations of Jedi Knights; and (12) The New Jedi Order.  The attempt by Wallace, with Anderson, is to write history rather than tell stories, although the result falls pretty much somewhere in between.  If you want to now what happened before, in between, and after the two movie trilogies, then this chronology certainly does tells you what you need to know.  The dating convention employed in the chronology uses the Battle of Yavin as its zero point, treating the destruction of the first Death Star and the dawning of "a new hope" for the people of the galaxy as the symbolic beginning of the current society.  Therefore events preceding that point in time are indicated B.B.Y., and those afterwards as A.B.Y.  The only real complaint here is that you have to go to the "Star Wars" web site to track down the extensive list of historical resources, so unless you are as well versed in the various "Star Wars" novels, comic books, and computer games as you are in the twin movie trilogies, you are not going to know where Wallace and Anderson are getting all of the puzzle pieces.  So you have a couple of hoops to jump through to even find out whether there is a story about the Battle of Dreighton or the death of Zsinj to track down let alone to read.  There is a four-page index, so that if you already know about the Kaiburr Crystal or want to see everything there is to know about Chewbacca or Mon Montha, you can find what the chronology has to say about them.  The back of the book includes a map of the galaxy, so you can find Hoth and Bespin in the Outer Rim, trace the Corellian Run and the Perlemian Trade Route, and distinguish the Core Worlds from the Colonies and those of the Inner Rim.  "Star Wars: The New Essential Chronology" is one of seven volumes in this series of reference books, the others being: "Star Wars: The New Essential Guide to Characters," "Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Droids," and "Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons" (all of which are also written by Wallace), along with "Star Wars: The New Essential Guide to Weapons & Technology," "Star Wars: The New Essential Guide to Vehicles & Vessels," and "Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Alien Species."  At face value this volume is the best of the bunch because it is the most useful in terms of putting all of the pieces together.  Of course, if you are interested in adding your own stories to the "Star Wars" galaxy, you would probably need the entire library to make sure you have yourself covered.  You would not want to have R2-D2 colored the wrong way or something 
 This book is probably one of the only books on Kate to not focus on her life, but on her movies. The author analyzes each one so intricately and finds how Hepburn was a premiere feminist in each one. It's interesting when you read about his analysis of several Tracy/Hepburn movies, as well as "The Philadelphia Story." The movies, according to the author, try to teach Hepburn a lesson and make her conform to the standards of the patriarchy. Interesting to note, the author also compares and contrasts several films of Bette Davis, Bacall/Bogart, and Astaire/Rogers with Hepburn's films as well. Excellent read- very professional. The best part about this book probably is that it's loaded with glossy, beautiful pictures from almost every movie Kate made. 
 This album is a good gateway to Madlib projects like Yesterdays New Quintet.  Before letting the next few reviewers get you all worked up about Madlib stealing people's music, consider that alot of hip-hop guys throw mix albums together the same way madlib's done here.  As well as some mediocre, re-worked soul-jazz classics, there are some covers by madlib minions like Sound Directions and Yesterday's New Quintet (YNQ's electrified cut of "Footprints" by Wayne Shorter works out well here).  I like the re-do of "Stormy" here, but all in all, this is a gateway, nothin more.  I do recommend you put it in your collection though, and once you've got your toes in the water, pick up the record "Untinted: Sources for Shades of Blue" which contains all the originals. 
 I remember reading this in the 4th grade.  It introduced me to the world of poetry in a "lauguage" that I could understand.  I had to buy it for my own children.  The arrival time was excellent from the time that I placed the order 
 What is unusual about The Truth about Managing Your Career...And Nothing but the Truth is that readers at different levels in their careers will find this book useful.  Someone graduating from school or someone aiming at the executive suite will benefit from reading it.  The underlying messages in the book are profound yet simple ways to develop the most effective mindset, behaviors and approaches to use in the workplace.  The 60 chapters are truths which help you excel in your current job as well as pave the way to the next level in your career.  One of the most practical aspects of this book is the way it unveils the causes and reasons for mistakes you have made without being aware of them until later when you are puzzled.  I found this book and its examples very enlightening.  Anita Yeung Hong Kon 
 OHMYGOD- this book rocks! Quit work for a week and dive in- Every sentence will enrich your soul- She's THAT amazing 
 Fans of the old-time author Chad Oliver who have scoured shelves in search of his stories in past will be delighted with this issue of two separate volumes of his selected stories. A Star Above It offers twenty stories ranging from the title presentation to Old Four-Eyes and Land of Lost Content. Other worlds, unrealities, and struggles abound in these 
 He should have won three Oscars in a row! This is better than Forrest Gump & Philadelphia, it has absolutely everything going for it. Cast, effects, writing, costume, music, cinematography, and most of all the fact that it is based on true events. So even though you know what happened it still is a thrilling ride - right until the end.  If I could give 6 stars for any movie this would be it (maybe Ed Wood too). Everyone in this movie does a perfect job, a perfect gathering of talent. It is so good that everytime I watch this movie I find something else to like about it. this is very rare I think but Apollo 13 sustains interest well beyond the first viewing 
 It's not really the blinding spell of Kathleen Edwards' recent "Austin City Limits" appearance that I remember the most about "Back To Me," her second recording.  No, it's something about how Edwards' sound so closely jibes with how it feels to be in the country.  Say you're out around Amarillo, watching the rim of Palo Duro Canyon saw at the horizon just off your left shoulder.  It's a summer day, and you have the windows rolled down because you have to.  You see breezes undulating the grass, and there's a quiet almost everywhere, even in how the hot sun hits the flanks of rusty billboard towers.  You know the colors are changing because it's sunset, but not quite.  When I heard Edwards singing on the television that first night, about a dozen country rides through the grand prairie came right back at me.    While almost all the lazy writers in the music business have compared Edwards to Lucinda Williams because it's an abbreviated way to highlight similarities they share--a girl's beauty, an edgy toughness and, of course, electric guitars--neither songwriter quite deserves it.  Edwards' output has an organic quality Williams simply can't touch.  You'll hear sharp distinctions between guitar and bass, for instance, whenever and wherever Williams plays.  Edwards, though, manages to blur instrumental lines until the mix is whole and even intimate, giving "Back To Me" an almost nostalgic flavor reminiscent of some of the best progressive country and folk rock soundscapes of the 1970s.  Jackson Browne's "Late For The Sky" may come to mind should listeners find themselves in some of Edwards' lonelier spaces.  Edwards also carries a soft voice through several hard tunes.  That's not easy to do.  "In State" is where she chews out some guy for acting a little too cavalier, for trying to grease his wheels too liberally, and like any woman worth the trouble, Edwards slices off the choice words even the toughest buzzards are loath to hear: "You wouldn't even be yourself if you wern't telling a lie."  It wouldn't hurt so much if her voice wasn't so pretty.    And "Pink Emerson Radio"?  That one sent a wind blowing through the drapes of a certain past I barely remember and right up my spine.  I've been in old houses just like the song sounds.  I've caught girlfriends, too, when they're alone and contemplating little trinkets that mean so much to them, many of which, of course, had nothing at all to do with me.  But it's alright.  I've treasured a couple of things.    Strong lyrics, never forced or trite, build through every song--without any of the flashiness or ostentatiousness some of the more "Nashvillian" rockers push on their crowds because the authenticity didn't come through when it was supposed to.  Moods change, in an Edwards song, the band sometimes kicks in like a rattling freight train just starting to move, heavy on a trestle, but always because Edwards obviously has been allowed to remain close to her music, and to the sound in her head.  Far too much music in today's declining sales climate has been drained of such qualities.  Edwards, however, is part of a quietly growing movement which may eventually inject a little reality into a country music world that's starting to flirt with the emblems of hip-hop of all things.  But the bling of Kathleen Edwards is in her heart.  Even if she's not from Texas.  God bless her.            
 You're curious about beautifull topics in math, but reading a classical texbook, browsing through a list of lemma and therorems just get you sleep ? Read this one. The idea behind theorems, and why and how they came alive  are so nicely exposed that this  book can replace your favorite  bed time  one 
 ATB has his sophomore album can't be any better by having a 2CD release of Two Worlds. It is a mix of The World of Movement on CD1 and The Relaxing World on CD2. On the first CD it gets started with a dawning song "See U Again" which then goes into the singles such as "The Summer" (having the guitar effect of his earlier singles "9 PM" and "Don't Stop") as well as "The Fields of Love" feat. York that has an amazing melody and the last single "Let U Go" with the Canadian band The Wild Strawberries. Also on CD1 has 2 songs featuring the Bermudan singer Heather Nova. On CD2-The Relaxing World it has a more chilled, Ibiza influence than the other CD and is nice to listen to while falling asleep or waking up after a party. Also on this CD it has 2 collaborations with the famous ambient act Enigma which contributes 2 beautiful flowing melodieswith this great collaborations. If you dont really like dance music, this is the one for you as it has many other influences and is a pretty damn good chill out album 
 I buy this drive to replace my old IDE hard drives, this is a very fast and silent drive, and it includes the SATA cable with Secure Connect, this is a great product 
 Terri Blackstock is a master story weaver. Her characters are believable and she keeps you glued to the pages until the very last one 
 This book is easy to read and most importantly it is easy to incorporate the recommended techniques into your existing bodywork.  I am a massage therapist but I think non therapists would find it useful/helpful also.  I plan to use it often! 
 I in 1996 I bought and read All the Pretty Horses first. Laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  Bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading Pretty Horses on the way.  Along with scenes from the Orchard Keeper, Sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that I'd rather see more of.  Sutree made me feel that I know this man, and could even like him.  Great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading. 
 This is not a guide for those looking for in-depth knowledge on Strategic Planning. Rather it is a very useful tool in the process of getting a team of managers together and producing a Strategic Plan. It focuses on results whilst under a time pressure and gets you to the point of having a plan that you can work to and produce results. Although aimed at the CEO or leader I have found it works best when each member of the team is given a copy of the book so that they then understand the process being followed. This leads to quicker a consensus amongst the team on the areas covered within the plan 
 The thrill of a romance and the satisfaction of a good sci-fi. The premise deals with a planet where the occupants originally came from earth, but have been cut off from it for a couple generations. The settlers now have their own, different planetary and genetic history that create the background for this story. I recommend it to Laurell Hamilton/Anita Blake fans and to Dara Joy/Dark series fans. It is a favorite sci-fi romance mystery and I am sorry to see that others have given it so little credit for a successful change in venue. I would love to see another book(s) based on these characters or simply using the same background 
 Please reprint I need a new one!  My book is falling apart because it is used so much! Every recipe I have tried has been a success. Try  the stuffed turkey the next time you cook one, what a fillin 
 A sure-fire indication of a hit--I read this book nine times (eight by request) the first day we got it.  My 2 year old loves it, and was dancing around the house singing "boogie, woogie, oogie" tonight.  A brightly colored, fun book...definitely worth having 
  I don't want to give any of the excellent story away.  I will say that it begins with out of towner Wynne making frequent business trips and staying at the hotel Paula manages.  A chemistry develops.  But do Paula and Wynne want the same things?  Do they both think the miles that separate them can be overcome and a deeper relationship created.  The writing is super and so enjoyable that were the novel to run to 600 pages I would love it.  The settings in Florida, Maryland and Colorado are woven perfectly into the story.  The humor is witty, prevalent throughout the novel and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The passion is intense and the journey not always predictable.  This is a Keeper!  Look for this author's novels to be published later in 2006 -   Mulligan - September 2006 House on Sandstone - December 2006  Other titles from this author include `Shaken' and `Malicious Pursuit' 
 Like all 2(x)ist underwear I own, this brief is made of superior materials and appears to be built to last. It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid.   If you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period.   For those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it.   Clearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants.   I found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive.   Practical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of "expansion room". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs.   If you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page 
 This is a great book for the average male reader who needs a quick funny read. This book tells the story as it unfolds of thirteen year olds back in the fifties after the Korean war and how they spend their spare time. These daredevils perform the unthinkable just because they don't have anything better to do. Gary Paulsen twists a wacky sense of humor into this piece that will keep your side splitting with laughter. A must read 
 Like another reviewer commented, this book is great for self teaching.  With this book I am able to preview the chapter before class, understand it, decipher my professor's chicken scratch on the board, and ask intelligent questions about the material.  True, it doesn't have the solutions to every single problem, though it does have solutions to every *type* of problem.  You work/solve the problem of the same type as the problem with which you are having trouble, and extrapolate that knowledge to the problem you need to work.  This book is exactly the kick in the brain I needed to start receiving better grades 
 I spent three months living and working in Mexico and this was a great guide to get settled in with a lot of relevant information! A great read 
 Time Out Buenos Aires delivers the feel of the city along with suggestions of where to go, what to do and how to get there.  It provides a sense of the spirit as well as offerings of the city.  The descriptions are enticing 
 "Ripley Under Ground" is the second novel in the Ripley series by the talented Patricia Highsmith.  In the first novel, readers were introduced to Tom Ripley - a poor player who wishes for a better life and achieves it through ill-gotten gains.  The charm of Tom Ripley is that even though he is an amoral murderer, the reader roots for him to get away with all the evil deeds he has committed.  This second book finds him married and living a rather quiet, peaceful life in France.  He is the conspirator of Derwatt Ltd., a company that manufactures paintings by an artist who has supposedly been dead for the past six years.  When questions of forgery arrive through an American visitor, Tom impersonates the artist but to little avail.  He later introduces himself to the American visitor as Tom Ripley, and invites him to his home in France to view the two Derwatt paintings he owns, in a desperate attempt to persuade the man to change his mind.  Despite all his charm and storytelling, the man refuses to budge on his theory and plans to seek out an expert when he returns to London.  Tom knows that he must take matters into his own hands to prevent this and the damage it would cause to everyone involved.  Tom Ripley is a thoroughly interesting character.  He is intelligent and philosophical despite his amoral adventures into corruption and murder.  He truly believes that he is doing what is best for himself and those involved.  As the story progresses, and the situation becomes even more desperate, there seems to be far too many loose ends to tie up - and Highsmith doesn't end them tidily.  She leaves room open for the series to continue, with questions abounding in the readers' minds.  And through everything we witness Tom do, we still want to see him succeed, even in the most grisly of tasks 
 This is one of my favorite books. It is geniusly simple, respectful and powerful. I was surprised to find out that I can easily apply the 3 principles in almost every relationship. So many people around deserve to be praised and taught a lesson and it is very important HOW you will do it because the final result can be very positive or just the opposite. It is a very valuable book which is very well written and is a fast read. I also highly recommend the other books from the One Minute Manager series because every book has a lot to offer and they will be especially helpful if you are in a business environment. 
 This movie is one sequence after another set-up for one reason, to display the martial arts of Mark Dacascos.  The plot, lame, the budget - lame, the action - spectacular!!!  The acting from support charcahters like Kadeem Hardison and a yung Brittany Murphy as well as John Pyper-Ferguson are just fun.  Dacascos is one of the more exciting martial artists to watch, but he garners few quality roles.  Even in movies that he does not get a good role, he generally makes the best of it.  This movie is a great choice fo raction fans, silly plot, but one great action scene after another.  Bring in the popcorn, soda, and chips.  recline and enjoy 
 I work for a satellite TV company that is dabbling in WiMAX. We found this pub to be very helpful in bringing along a lot of people fast in the basic concepts of WiMAX. Believe you me, its a real industrial sociology challenge to get a whole organization onboard with a new technology. This book, given its 50+ illustrations, really helped us train our folks real fast in WiMAX. I don't know this for fact, but I'm assuming it was real helpful to our overseas offices in getting non-english speakers up to speed quick as well. 
 This movie is almost inaudible, that being said it is still AWESOME.  The picture quality is also very poor, but since it's more about the training and not the fighting, it's not too bad.  The story is about a young kid whose dad is a rebel.  After his dad is killed by the governer or something, he tries to get into shaolin to learn how to fight.  His experiences in Saholin are truly funny and truly great scenes.  Gordon using the 15 foot branch with the weight on the end to strike the gong is REAL.  Now I have a version that says it is part of the shaolin collection.  It also has the SB logo all over it.  It is just like my return and disciples of master killer movies.  It says it is remastered, AND IT IS, the remastering company is RED SUN.  Though I had never heard of them before, I will start looking for what movies they distribute rather than just finding my favorite movies and getting a crap print.  You have no excuse not to look for the Red Sun version before you buy this, you don't even need an all-region dvd player.  
   Sickly fascinating.  A perfectly normal girl living the life and her world spirals into hell.  So easily with so little resistance all of her friends and even family turn on her so that they may benefit.  Jesus.  Definitely a keeper.  I'm still sick to my stomach 
 I really enjoy this series.  The second book was even better than the first.  Ophelia is a realistic woman.  She gets petty, angry, scared, shy, protective and loving.  Plus anyone who has loved their grandmother will appreciate the relationship between Ophelia and her grandmother Abby. The mysteries are clever and worth your time 
 I take in you guys arguments about the running order of these extraordinary albums.   To explain the obvious. The British running orders are correct as the appear on the records. There were two singles which made it on to some reissues. But the music is as it wa 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could read it over and over.  Whereas many books about politicians are very dull, this one is the first one I found I couldnt put down. John Adams personal letters and his descriptions of our nation's capitol at that time makes you feel as if you were there. For the first time for many people you can get a real handle on what the REvolution was all labout. I do desperately wish this book was available in my high school history classes in the 1940's. Every young person in school today should read this book in addition to their class history books. 
 This toy is amazing, my son recieved it for his first birthday. He is now turning 2 and it is STILL one of this favorite toys.  Every kid that enters my house plays with this toy.  It is very easy they can even hit it with their hand if the hammer isn't around.  I did however wonder how i would clean this once some dirt had built up inside...but i solved that easily...i just ran it under the faucet and it cleaned up great.  And this toy has been banged around with no cracks at all 
 Gives a good overview of the challenges of small mag/newspaper etc publishing and gives alot of nuts and bolts type tips. Better to spend a little money on alot of good advice then to make the mistakes and learn the hard way.  The author writes like a veteran of learning the hard way and thankfully he is sharing his knowledge 
 I liked this book because it is very descriptive .I also liked the book because Gregor discovers a lot of new things I also loved that there were huge rats and different animals I also liked how he found his found dad in the under land and the city also sounded really coo 
 Both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and endlessly dressing Dora. Her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the clothes, too. We are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - Dora needs a place to sleep!  Dora is well made and sturdy, and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done.   And I have to admit ... I've been known to dress Dora a time or two myself. We have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well, but it doesn't seem to bother my little ones at all 
 Overall, it is a good book. There are many great examples used with relevant companies highlighted. The information presented can be interpreted as biased and I often disagree with slant taken. The book layout and design is busy, and all of the supplemental features can be detracting at times. 
 thanks Mr Lord, for your lovely semi classical music. I love his work on pictured within with Miller Anderson on voice, wait a while is pretty nice with Sam Brown on voice. the whole set is a must for Deep Purple fans. John Lord loves the classical stuffs alots and it is no wonder that Deep purple integrated their hard rock sound with the classical elements what Mr Lord  played. Thanks for Mr Lordy! he is a great master of rock and classical keyboard man 
 This woman tells it all and tells it as it is...This is a must read  and I have sent it to several friends who absolutely loved it also... Love the author and love the book...A 
 This is a wonderful, wide ranging, engaging memoir. It's all here - cousin marriage, intergenerational sex, cultural differences (and not the tedious starch you get served up in so much travel writing), criticisms of American society, a strong heart and powerful searching intelligence. "The Book of Trouble" is at the outset a love story. West Village writer meets significantly younger man from Afghanistan. Is he acceptable as a lover? No. Does she even consider him? No. Do they get together? Yes, briefly, savagely, and then sadly: it's all over.  Ann Marlowe is an acutely observant viewer of herself, and those around her: what they say, and what they think. She understands that what love is based on is a kind of tribalism, that you fall for people who reflect or refract the milieu you were raised in. The distance between herself, an American Jew, and Amir, an Afghan Muslim is, as she notes, much less than might be first imagined. Pursuing Amir, Marlowe is also pursuing Afghanistan, and the Middle East, and that chewy topic: America. What do Muslims have that the contemporary US has lost? Can it be retrieved? How? The love affair with Amir is always gently nudged back to politics and place. Picky giddy people should beware. This is probably not a book to read if you think that someone like Iraqi politician Ahmed Chalabi cannot be a rogue, and also charming. It's not for you if you imagine it's witty to cast aspersions on the author just because whipping-boy-du-jour James Frey has praised it. It's not for you if you like ideas and events neatly dissected and served on a plate like so much mental sashimi: appetising at the outset, but then an hour later you're hungry again. Yes, "The Book of Trouble" has troubling themes, but their treatment is invigorating and satisfying 
  This book deals with one of the most important issues facing modern man: the threat posed to humanism by various so-called progressive movements.  This is part of Ferry's ongoing project to expose the illiberal consequences of what is regularly called post-modernity.  (See his book on the Sixties as an essay on anti-humanism, and his statement on why he is not a Nietzschean).  Some of the practical issues discussed are the crucial distinctions between conservation and radical environmentalism; between anti-cruelty and animal rights.  The link between fascism in its most anti-humanist incarnation (Nazism) and "animal rights" should be studied - once animals have the rights of man, man is placed on par with animals.  It is no coincidence those carted off to Auschwitz and the eastern camps were sent in cattle cars.  These chapters on Nazi animal rights legislation, and the other progressive initiatives of that regime, is fascinating and important especially in light of contemporary European tendencies like the great ape project, support for euthanasia and other progressive ideas - like smoking bans.  This is one of the best popular books around to explain the formal and theoretical  connection between these seemingly unrelated ideas 
 very easy to read and follow, exellent summary of the essential facts and good practice questions good for preparing of any postgraduate exams in physiology highly recommended 
 This is the book that most people thought would never be written. So many people have been urging Jon Pyke for so many years to get down on paper what he really thinks. Of all the people in the process space, Jon is probably the most widely misquoted! It has been all too easy for people to say "Well, what Jon actually meant was!" and then turn it to suit their own purpose, now we can all get to find out what Jon actually thought!  This book is a veritable treasure trove of information, every page fact with some fact or factoid of note. There will be those in the BPM community who may find aspects of what Jon has to say hard to swallow. But, Jon more than most has the right to state his views and give corrections to the origins of some of the terms. As CTO of Staffware from 1992-2004, potentially the only truly successful vendor of the workflow era, Jon was in effect the father of workflow and by that fact the de facto father of BPMS - not that some would like to acknowledge that fact.  The book although jam packed with information, is a very easy read and, in the opinion of this reviewer at least, is probably the most complete, logical and digestible explanation of what process are and why they are important I have seen.  Full of tips and tricks on what to do and what to watch out for as you - in the name of the title - Master your Organizations Processes. The book does not set out to be a cook book, but instead guides your thinking and provides plenty of checklists to help you on your way. This approach is to be applauded, as all too many a good book on process has been spoiled by the first you do this, then you do this approach. The reality is that one size really does not fit all.  Its nine chapters are strongly focussed on success in business and never do you get the sense of technology for technology's sake - pretty good going for a former CTO! The chapters also contain lots of good case studies which certainly help and are easy to relate to.  If I had one criticism of the book it is that by its definition of BPM as technology it propagates (in my opinion) the lie that BPM is technology rather than using the more widely accepted term BPMS for the technology to support the management philosophy that is BPM.  The book is an absolute must read for any business, systems or process analyst in order to make sure that they stay focussed on what is really important - business results. It's non-jargon, non-technical style means that for any Manager it will serve as a great introduction to process management and will prove invaluable to them in the selection of processes to improve, tool selection and technology selection..  Now of course all we have to do is wait and see where Jon pops up next, it is now 2 years since his departure from Staffware, Jon what are you up to, when we will we be seeing the latest from you in the process space 
 York gives us the inner workings of the far left and the financial supporters of the Democrats.  This  quick and disturbing read is well written and informative.  He is able to get up close and personal by attending the Democrat/left wing rallies and functions.  At times, fought to gain an interview with people such as Podesta and Franken.   Byron also clears up some of the conspiracy theories made up by Moore and others.  Gossip:  "Do not spread slanderous gossip"--Leviticus 19:16  This is the new movement funded by George Sorros and "move on".  A new Democrat party is fashioned.  Why question Sorros when he has the money.  Keep in mind what the beliefs of the big Democrat money supporter are.   Byron also covers the 527 loopholes and abuses, (the do anything to win campaign.) He concentrates on a small group of individuals.  Hillary, Dean, Kerry and Moore are also hit upon.  He expounds on the Competition between conservative talk shows, and why liberal shows don't work.  I don't put NPR in this same category, hence recommend tuning in on occasion, especially PBS.  Even though they are biased, PBS does not tend be slanderous.  I don't agree with the federal funding of stations, but that is for another time.  Instead of putting their full effort into the election of John Kerry, they focussed more on taking down Bush.  The party for the poor?  Where is the funding coming from?  Support campaign finance?  Byron may spend a little too much time filling pages with movie statistics, but here is an interesting factoid:  "Fahrenheit 9/11 and the passion of Christ were remarkable indicators of how Americans would vote."  Liberalism--Apostasy:  "Do not be carried away by error"--2 Peter 3:17 
 I've read quite a lot of Ann Rule's writings, and this book, though not the best of all, was still one of the most unusual true stories I've heard.  Jerry Brudos was a sadistic, (putting it mildly), killer of women. His hatred for women stemmed from the time he was little, and his mother mistreated him a lot, and favored his older brother much more.  As a boy, he would have fetishes for ladies clothing/lingerie, and steal them from neighbors who had women living there. He committed his first murder later as a married man.   After Jerry was married to Darcie, and she bore him two children, one of them a girl child, whom he didn't love at all, Jerry became much worse. In their home in Oregon, he had a workshop that was kept secret from the family at all times. He'd kill the women, and put them in his workshop, and do the most sadistic things to them, then murder them usually by strangulation.   The women he murdered were all young and pretty. Linda Slawson was an encyclopedia saleslady door-to-door. Jan Whitney was a young college student, and Karen Sprinker was a pre-med student on the way to lunch with her mother, when she was murdered by Jerry. And not to mention, there was Linda Salee, who kept her boyfriend waiting for hours, worried sick about what happened to her.  The police finally put the two and two together, and it was then that Jerry was apprehended. And it was surprising that when he was caught, he told the stories of the women's murders openly, as though he was proud of it.  His wife unfortunately was considered an accessory to the crimes though she had absolutely no idea what was going on in her own home. But it is a long trial before her slate can be wiped clean. Their two children unfortunately, are taken into custody by the state until all of the evidence is proven otherwise that Darcie Brudos is innocent.  
 There is probably no book which has had a bigger impact on my overall view of Scripture itself and the task of preaching the "whole counsel of God" than this one. Goldsworthy succeeds not only in introducing the concept of biblical theology and showing its relevance to the task of expositional preaching, but actually walks the reader through each genre of Scripture outlining principles and providing examples for rightly interpreting the text. The book is not simplistic and doesn't dodge difficult passages and hermeneutical challenges. But it does squarely ground everything in some basic convictions about the nature and purpose of biblical revelation and its relationship to Christ. My own understanding of Scripture was deeply enriched by this book. And in my vocation as an expositor of Scripture I was both encouraged and challenged. I simply cannot recommend this book more highly.  
 This was the best Dr. Seuss book of them all! I read this book when I was a little kid and I still read it now! This is the best book you could buy 
 This pertains to the excellent audio book reading by Nanette Savard. Margolin does a great job in weaving the many characters and all their story angles to a satisfying conclusion.   I thought it had a realistic feel and an interesting plot (a crooked twisted forensic scientist gone bad...no spoiler). This is my third Margolin book and so far they all have been up to par and entertaining. 
 When Kristy meets her new neighbor, Her neighbors are not friendly, in fact...they are snobs. They always laugh at everything. they even laugh at Kristy's poor collie. Kristy is getting mad. Kristy and THE BSC must teach them a lesson 
 Dr. Hall's book is one for which I have been waiting.  It provides a tool for an all to common problem among women who when finding themselves in this situation tend to blame themselves.  It is not a blaming book, but more of a normalizing experience (this can happen to anyone given the demands of day to day life).  She then provides the reader with a practical guide for improving their own sexual self.  As a therapist I highly recommend this book to clients and as a woman's advocate I applaud her ability to direct her work toward women without a hint of blame just an empathic expertise. 
 Even though her life looks glamourous to us, she tells that it really isn't. I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happened next in her normal every-day adventures.She's also very funny in the book at times I was laughing out loud 
 I bought this movie on the basis that I am an Artie fan, and I have no regrets.  This movie turned out to be really funny, but only if you like Artie's sense of humor 
 this one was good but the other ones just seemed better... is still think you should ge 
 This is a great book for pre-teens, teens, and even adults who like fiction set in the ancient world.  Here we see the harsh social realities faced by foundlings in the life of Beric, Roman child adopted from the sea by Britons during the Roman Empire -- when exactly isn't given.  While I'm glad the attempt was made to show the harshness of life both in the north and then among the Romans there was still a bit of sugar-coating that is perhaps the result of wanting to respect our own morals or the result of a lack of knowledge.  Thus the sexual terror and abuse of slavery is not mentioned and there is the idea that slaves have special clothes or jewelery to mark their status which is not the case unless one had been a runaway or a master really wanted to use a collar or brand or tattoo.  The ending was also a bit too positive but then again most people don't want to read a sad tale even if it is more realistic 
 This is a great book for anyone wanting to be able to immediately take the edge off of stressful situations or to help others in a similar position.  My results have been mixed, but when you hit some of the zones described in the book before bed, you sleep WAY better than you would have otherwise.  It's well worth the small investment even if you only get a partial long-term benefit like I have.  My mom, sister, and other friends have received a lot more benefit from me using these techniques on them.  In fact, my sister who was going through a rough divorce couldn't believe I knew how to do "magic" like that! :)     
 Many years ago I happened to ask a student of mine in Melbourne, a mature woman whom I didn't even know very well, what was the best book that she'd ever read.  She replied that it was certainly Christina Stead's THE MAN WHO  LOVED CHILDREN.  I was stunned because I had never even heard of the  author.  Eight years later, in the middle of a howling Patagonian  wilderness, I traded some bad novels with an Australian traveler for that  very book and read it immediately with great anticipation.  No doubt this  is a great book.  The depth of psychological characterization of each  member of this painfully dysfunctional (older vocab.=messed up) family is  truly amazing.  The slow building up of each character absorbs the reader,  the ultimate disappointment of all the relationships is a marvelous  antidote to the idealistic optimism that prevails in Hollywood and beyond.   Still, I felt that the author could have cut some sections, or done away  with some extraneous side descriptions.  The only other question I have is  why Stead chose to write about Americans, with whose language peculiarities  she was not so familiar, instead of Australians or even Britishers, whose  particular dialects she must have known better.  I have never been able to  solve this problem because I never meet anyone with whom I could discuss  the book.  It certainly is one of the least-known great novels of the 20th  century 
 This great biography was written by an academic historian who gathers and compares several sources, yet the publisher to cut costs cuts the footnotes, which are of essential and greatest interest. In our era of intellectual property and knowledge as commodity, the publisher did not wish to provide the reader with specific indications for further study through the footnotes. With the collapse of the Internet we may never know what amplifications and insights the author may have included in these footnotes, which were no doubt as exhaustive as the work itself. How could the once great St. Martin's have been so academically irresponsible for commercial purposes? It is as inexplicable as our once great nation's journey from the intelligent JFK to the solipsistic W. 
 This is fantastic journalistic-style fiction that has all the elements of a great book:  gambling, Vegas, murder, sex, and the potential for personal ruin.  This book is ostensibly about the murder of Ted Binion and the sex/money scandal surrounding that.  This storyline is what sucks the reader in, but McManus quickly abandons that story for a much, much more fascinating one about playing in the World Series of Poker, held at Binion's Horseshoe and founded by the Binion family.  McManus was sent by Harper's magazine to cover the Binion story, but he's a cocky poker player himself, so he puts his welfare and relationship with his wife on the line by taking his entire advance and playing into the World Series.  Knowing that McManus has his own money on the line, and he's not funded by the magazine to make a good story, makes this journey absolutely amazing.  McManus teaches the reader how to play poker and gives the basics of the poker masters' strategies, so that the reader is able to play along with the highs and lows of the game.  McManus even finds himself playing against people whose poker books he has read, so he knows what they taught him and the rest of the world about poker, which makes for interesting mind games at the table.  I would love to give this book 5 stars, but there is some material in here which really should have been edited out.  McManus goes off for pages about how he knows David Sedaris or the illustrator of Me Talk Pretty One Day, or some other fact that is unrelated to the book and serves only to prove how cosmopolitan the author is.  He also gives not only his childhood story, but that of his father and grandfather, and I found those to be very trying chapters that distracted from the high paced action of the book without adding any real meat to the story.  This is a great intro to poker, and McManus gives the reader enough info to get them intersted in the game, and to know what books and software to check out if they want to start playing.  I highly recommend this book to any non-fiction lover 
 I never expected to be moved so much by this book, to feel so strongly about it. Published in 1927, I expected something dated, both in prose and story -- it wasn't at all. This novel isn't just as it's usually described: adventures of a golden-tongued evangelist who lives a live of hypocrisy and self-indulgence. This also isn't a novel whose primary purpose is to attack the clergy. This is a profile of the USA, of the American psyche, a profile that still works today. I finished the book and sat staring out the window for 10 minutes. I didn't know whether to laugh or weep.  What's so disheartening about this book, for me, is, as noted in the afterword by Mark Schorer, "The forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in "Elmer Gantry" are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality." This is a book where all the good guys go down.   Maybe you have to have been raised in the South or Midwest of the USA, and to have been brought up Baptist or Methodist, to really, truly get all the layers of this magnificent book, all the hidden humor, all the razor-sharp and, at times, incredibly subtle, criticism and commentary. If you've never been to a church supper where a person proudly claims to have traced their lineage all the way back to Adam and Eve, if you have never had your school board or local city council hear arguments about why certain books should be banned from school or local libraries, if a significant number of your family wouldn't boycott your wedding if you chose to serve alcohol, if you have never heard Catholics called "Papists" from a pulpit, if school friends haven't told you, in all sincerity, that they are going to pray for you because of your questions and intellect, if you haven't heard "Christians" rationalize about their actions that are in direct contrast to what the Bible says, if you haven't noticed the onslaught of efforts to get science out of our schools, I'm not sure you can really, truly "get" this book.  Part of me is ashamed to have only finally read Sinclair Lewis when I'm already 40 -- and part of me wonders if I could ever have understood this book on the level I feel that I do had I not been this age.  Still a landmark in American literature, still a biting, chilling commentary on our country 
 HELLO HE LIED is written by Lynda Obst one of the top female producers in Hollywood. (I only say female because she does talk about the challenges of being a woman in Hollywood). Her films include such classics as THE FISHER KING, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and CONTACT. She lives in Los Angeles and Texas -- which should give you a hint already that it's important to get some distance now and then (and maybe more) from TWINKLETOWN -- I MEAN TINSELTOWN. Her advice to NEVER GO TO A MEETING WITHOUT A STRATEGY is one we all should remember. All too often we worry about our powerpoint or our clothes or our car-- and not the strategy and outcome we want. IT's this good common sense business stuff that makes Lynda's book different from so many schmoozerama books -- how to schmooze and meet and network with Moguls in Hollywood. All too often MAGIC is associated with Hollywood movies and dealmakings and Lynda lets you know that it's not magic but good hard work and a thick SKIN. She also mentions Yoga and has a bit of a zen approach to all of this that makes us realize it ain't brain surgery! Her chapter on the TAO of Power and her description of how the film THE HOT ZONE did/didn't get made is fascinating....what a smart lady this is. If you are a woman you'll like the section called CHIX IN FLIX...oh you don't need any more recommenation-- just buy it - used or new-- I don't know why it took me so long to read it....BUT DO IT -- all of life is Hollywood in some way now -- ie American Idol etc. 
 Most of l'Eclisse was fimed in the EUR district of Rome. The urban design complements the spare dialogue between the two main characters. The final scene is one of the greatest in film history. One of Antonioni's finest 
 i love this cd.it is great i like willa ford and oliver james.oliver's songs are so good  i want him to make a cd of his own.i like almost all the songs.it has 11 songs that i listen to over and over !!!! you can't find a lot of cds like. i almost know the songs by heart i give it 2 thumbs up and if a had more i would give them too !!!!!!!  
 Bueller, Ferris Bueller  OK, lets start off with what wrong with this edition of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  there are two problem  I see with this new Bueller Bueller DVD edition of Ferris...One is the over use of actor/know it all Ben Stein and the missing director John Hughes's missing audio commentary.  Now the good news. There are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie.   And then there is the movie itself-The extras are fine. However the film is a minor classic.   Matthew Broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye. Broderick's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience. He is part Robert Preston from the Music Man/Part W.C. Fields/Part Robert Wagner from  It Takes a Thief. Broderick playing Ferris is slick, sly and a con man with style. He pokes a stick of his collective eye of Principal Jeffrey (Deadwood) Jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment.  The supportive cast of Alan (Spin City) Ruck and Mia Sara makes a sorta lover's triangle without love nor passion..more deeper friendship. The two combined with Broderick makes this film a buddy movie, rather than a TEEN  angst film (like Not another Teen Movies or Ten Things I hate about you)  So want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked, get this film  and as Ferris would say, "What are you Still doing here? Why aren't you buying this yet?"  Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
 In the late '70s and early '80s, Rick James did more than anyone to challenge George Clinton's place on the funk throne. Eventually, his music would turn into a very tired cliché, but at his creative peak, James was among the most exciting and vital artists funk had to offer. Summarizing his Motown output from 1978-1986 and offering four new tracks from 1994 as well, this two-CD anthology reminds you just how great he once was, but it provides evidence of his artistic decline as well. Though some of the songs are mediocre, most are outstanding. Even the most casual funk fans owe it to themselves to savor such rowdy classics as "Super Freak," "You and I," "Love Gun," "Give It to Me Baby," and "Ghetto Life." James was equally superb when it came to soul ballads -- and anyone who thinks otherwise should give a serious listen to "Fire and Desire" (a stunning duet with Teena Marie), "Dream Maker," and "Ebony Eyes" (which features Smokey Robinson). Sadly, "Cold Blooded" and "17" illustrate how formulaic James' funk often sounded by the mid-'80s. Meanwhile, some of the new material (including an enjoyable remake of Norman Connors' "You Are My Starship") indicated that he had the potential to make a comeback with the right guidance. Boasting many more pluses than minuses, this set is the best place for novices to start 
 Lucy Anne Hurston, the neice of Zora Neale Hurston, in a collaborative effort with the Estate of the great writer, has produced a beautiful tribute to her aunt and also a collector's item for fans of Zora Neale Hurston.  Not only does it include biographical sketches of the famous author, but also live interviews, as well as a CD of folk songs sung by Hurston.  The pages of this book are rich in heritage, painting a kaleidoscope of her life.  Touching on her childhood, her days attending Howard University, and of course her writing, the reader is able to see that even though Zora Neale Hurston wrote about memorable characters, she too could have been one of the characters she wrote about.  Because of the replications of original letters, maps, photos and writings, the reader is given a more detailed account of her life, told by someone who knew and loved her.  Each of these are in pull-out sleeves and envelopes, easily removed from the book to allow closer inspection upon, or displayed vividly on the full color and black and white pages of the book.   SPEAK, SO YOU CAN SPEAK AGAIN is a fascinating keepsake of a writer who means so much to not only the Harlem Renaissance and to African-American readers and writers, but also to literature as we know it.  Through this collection, readers are offered an intimate portrait of a literary legend.  Reviewed by Tee C. Royal of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers 
 All I can say is WOW!  I watched the movie "The Secret" 48 Hours ago, and now have found Esther and Jerry Hicks in that same time period.  If you are earnestly seeking a better Life, you will find it.  "Birds of a Feather Flock Together"  I am just blown away with my Transformation in the past 2 days.  I went to Barnes and Nobles last night about this time.  We couldn't find any of Esther and Jerry's Books.  I just began walking around, believing some how, some way this book would find me.  Well the Employee at Barnes and Nobles tracked me down, and guided me to another section.  We still couldn't find any of their books.  The Employee walked away and I thought I would never see him again.  Well, as I started to walk away the third time, he came walking towards me with asserment, and handed me the Book "The Law of Attraction"  Never in my Life at Barnes and Nobles had I met a Employee who was so PERSISTENT on finding me a Book.  Then I began asking??  Was this myself, the employee at Barnes and Nobles, or the Principles of the Law of Attraction?  They say when the Student is ready, the Teacher will come.  Well it's 10:35 P.M. almost 24 Hours later and I have read all 194 pages of this Book.  I truly have found what I am looking for in this amazing Book.  In life there are Laws, Laws of Gravity, Laws of our Government, Laws of Prosperity, Wealth, Health,etc.  If you want to play the Game of Life, you must know the Universal Laws.  It starts with getting a foundation within the Laws of Attraction.  When you think your life sucks, your work is awful, your relationships are just horrible, guess what you will attract?? Those exact things.  Your life is a magnet, what you think about you will attract, it's a Law.  When you think about Health,Wealth,Prosperity, Great Relationships, you will attract those things.  Your Life's make up is within you, you dictate how it will be played, not your surroundings.  Get your mind right and start today. Read this amazing Book!.  I had no idea who the Hick's where 48 Hours ago, but by reading this Book my life has been transformed overnight.  I will never be the same person again, and the same goes for you.

 This isn't the best kids movie out there, but its not too bad. Its not just for the little kids this time since it is about young teens. Of coarse it has that red headed boy thats in like every single kids movie, hes kinda weird, anyway theres only 2 cute boys in this one! anyway gotta go 4 now 
 Nora Roberts does trilogies so well! This entire trilogy was wonderful and this was a magnificent conclusion.  By this point you love Mia and her friends.  While I'm not big into supernatural plot lines, Roberts manages to pull it off without a hitch.  
 The direction of this film is excellent.  I love all the characters and the way they interact.  The storyline is very important also.  It's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other.  It's a well-paced and interesting story that's not like anything else I've ever seen. 
 This book was so much fun to read!  How it wove the past and the present together was just brilliant.  If you've read "Chocolat" then, this is the next book you should be reading! 
 I got about 6 pairs of Gold Toe socks.  They're the most comfortable socks I've worn in a long time.  You don't even feel like you have socks on.  They fit well and are made well.  If your hesitating, no need.  I'm not sorry I bought them

 To the reader who was SHOCKED by the author's treatment of biblical subjects involving women: do you allow your children to read the Bible at all? If you do, and if they ask you why it has so many stories involving the mistreatment of women, how do you answer?  The Bible is a product of its time. The work in question is a classical study of the treatment of women in the Bible. It's not reading matter for most children; neither is it a suitable work for children to learn about the role of women in the Bible.  This work is a serious attempt to treat the tales written about women in the Bible in a style of "historical fiction," taking the viewpoint of a narrator of the action. The result is an enlightening vision of a society where, for the most part, women were property with a status of just below slaves. In reading the Bible, one is struck by how the authors uniformly take for granted the typical lack of status possessed by women. Women were not typically written about in favorable ways. Indeed, the only reason for the mention of Dinah, Jacob's daughter, is her rape by the son of the ruler of the neighboring town. The reader is then truly astounded, after reading further about the lowly status of women, to learn that the ancient Hebrews subsequently built protections for women into their laws and customs, thus rejecting the treatment of women by all of their surrounding cultures.   It is with this viewpoint that one should approach the reading of this work. It retells the tales of the Bible of events that occurred in everyday life in the ancient cultures of the Near East in terms with which a modern reader can identify, and in so doing, exposes the horrors of a woman's life during those times.  It was the rejection of womens' subjugation and lack of any legal status that the Hebrews, and later, Israelites, sought; the result was a code of law (in Leviticus, primarily) that gave protections to women unheard of and unimagined in neighboring cultures.  This is what the book is about, and women can rejoice in its telling. This is a serious book. It's not a book for kids 
 Great product.  Son enjoys being in the chair.  He especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray.  Only thing I don't like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion 
 This is an excellent childrens book. I read them when I was little. My little cousin Anna just loves them. This is a series that never fails to please the childs mind. It's good for kids who have just started reading short novels 
 I bought this book for my husband for our first wedding anniversary (first is paper.)  He loved it!  A great story, wonderful drawings and just the right message.  A great gift 
 It's been several years since I read this book, and my memory is rubbish, but I can still vividly remember scenes and passages from it. Right from the opening, this book lures you into a tale within a tale. The story opens with a parable that spans modern and ancient worlds and one that that ends before its moral is revealed.  The book reads like a zen koan in many respects - characters, plot and themes intertwine but none dominate proceedings and the reader is ultimately left to fend for themselves.  The depictions of life in this book are amazing. There are details and asides on every page that draw you in yet the story always moves relentlessly forward, never becoming mired in the prose. The author is a master story teller and writer. He never uses two words where one will do. There is no section of the book where you think: `hmmm could have done with cutting this bit out'.  The one thing I will say is that my Mum didn't quiet like this book as much as me. She said it was good but very much a `man's book'. Perhaps this is true. Naipaul pulls no punches and does not spare his characters or the reality they live in. However he is neither pessimistic nor nihilistic, although there are unflinching portrayals of the human condition. Although life can be grim Naipaul treats his characters with dignity and sympathy. The title reveals the nuance and care of every word within:  a book poised beautifully between a life half full and a life half empty 
 Bet you don't think you have a dark side. This book makes known the unknown. Tons of great information. Easy to read and comprehend. Learn something about yourself. Highly recommended 
 I just ran across a used copy of this book and have heartily enjoyed it. Handelsman's experiences with the remarkable presence and intelligence of plants mirrors my own. Learning to meet plants on their own terms is truly an art and such a rewarding one. Handelsman tells her experieces very simply and honestly. Anyone who has approached plants, trees and gardens as a place to grow both their own spirit and sense of community with the natural world will recognize a kindred spirit in this writer. I particularly enjoyed her focus on interacting and learning from houseplants since that opens the experience up to both urban and rural folks who want to explore interacting with plants in a deeper rather than just decorative manner. I'm thrilled to have found a simple book with simple wisdom that opens another level of love and awareness of life 
 ...As I stated in my opening paragraph, I believe the title of the book is actually a misnomer. This might be the only real criticism I have of the book.  At the end of Chapter 10, Sperber tries to argue that schools receiving negative ratings re party schools that have the beer and circus.  I think he commits a post hoc fallacy by attempting to assert that the big - time sports is a cause of the party image and negative rating.  At best, I think he proves a correlation between big-time sports and negative academic ratings but that is more a function of misplaced priorities of administrators, legislators and alumni than anything else.  To reduce the argument  the way he has is to do the rest of his well developed and insightful criticism a disservice 
 I first read A Short History while on business in Australia. I couldn't put it down. The writing is outstanding and the information is communicated in language that anyone can understand. I have been re-reading A Short History with my kids, and they love it. This is a book for all ages 
 Stephen King is a master storyteller.  And he proves here, as in other short story collections of his, that, be a thousand pages or ten, he can still terrify the reader.  This, King's earliest collection, is also his best.  What never ceases to amaze me is King's ability to take completely ridiculous concepts and make them truly terrifying.  For instance, some of the stories in this book concern demonic trucks, a possessed industrial laundry machine, killer toys, and a race of mutant rats.  A lesser writer wouldn't dare to try and make these into realistic horror stories.  But King's talent for embracing that which is campy and cliched in summary, and rendering it into a bone chilling reality bears witness to his genius as a writer.  Several of the stories from this book have been made into very bad movies:  The Mangler, Sometimes They Come Back, the Lawnmower Man, Children of the Corn, The Boogeyman.  Yet the original short stories are pure miniature masterpieces.  My personal favourites are The Ledge, Quitters, Inc., Graveyard Shift, Gray Matter, The Mangler, and Night Surf.  Truly, shorter is not lesser with Stephen King. 
 The more historically accurate the film, the more it tends to drag.  The Molly Maguires certainly passes this test!  Still, it presents a fascinating account of an oppressed people and a wrong-headed response which brought them into conflict with the Church 
 was forwarned about this one..but wanted to experience it myself. the directors camera style was very hard to take but overall added to the feeling of control being taken from you. great performances by all the actors. the reverse storytelling was used to great advantage. subtitles not to hard to follow..overall a shocking unexpected experience i would give 5 outa 5 to.  
 As a professor at the State University of New York--Plattsburgh, I'm always looking for new case studies and ideas to share with my undergraduate students.  The book clearly demonstrates what professionals  in various fields are doing to improve structures within different  contexts.  Having worked with various non-profit organizations, this  resource guide is useful both as a practioner and observer of  organizational communication.  Each of the proposed interventions clearly  define, describe and apply techniques that could definitely improve  communication within the workplace. I'm especially fond of the resources  and references included at the end of each intervention 
 I got this book a couple years ago and it really helped.  Its great to just look at and I even take it with me sometimes when I sit so the kids can look at it. Even they like it 
 How sad to see so many people accusing Jesus of witchcraft, of course this is not unexpected, the scribes and Pharisees did that kind of thing. They accused Him of casting out demons by the prince of demons. I suppose because those involved in witchcraft were known to practice casting out demons, then it followed in their eyes that Jesus must be doing the same thing. I find nothing in the book that is not biblical in its meaning. I actually cannot find the word levitation mentioned in the Bible. Yes I know it is associated with witches, but it also is applied in medicine in the treatment of burns, where people are supported on a cushion of air to aid quicker healing. Satan mimics the miracles and ministry of Jesus, it is not the other way round. Satan does them for his own ends. Jesus does them as The Son of God. Satan does them for evil, and Jesus for good. So I would not want to many of you risking speaking out the way you are against the Jesus that the Scriptures really reveal. Satanists pray, so should we. Satanists offer human sacrifice. Jesus offered Himself as a human sacrifice as The Son of God. Jesus walked on the water, in so doing He defied the rules of science, just as is depicted in levitation re witches. He did an even greater things, He arose from the dead leaving the grave clothes exactly as they were when they were bound around Him. After that He ascended to Heaven, having first descended into Hell (Hell has many meanings, and is depicted with different names). Essentially Hell is used to relate to all the things associated around it in our modern day English. We need to communicate in the language of the people to get the message over. Satanists seek to raise the dead and mimic Jesus. I have no problems seeing my Jesus (the one the Bible declares) as doing the things that are depicted in the book re Choo Thomas. He is greater than Satan, and does greater things than he can do. He does them out of love, not out of hate like Satan does. I do not see Choo presenting works unto salvation. I see that we are saved unto good works, and by our deeds we will be judged as to what rewards we recieve. For only those works that come through the test of fire will remain, the rest will be burnt up. So if we are not producing pure works then there will be nothing left but the the grace of God (praise God for that), and yes we will have lowly positions.  Somehow we seem to forget that Jesus said "You call me Lord and Master" and asked why we do not do what He asks us to do.  We are being called into obedience to Christ, to obey Him. Too many of us are more interested in doing what we want to do, and then in troubled times asking Jesus to help us.  The book clearly depicts the difference between those that are obedient and those that or not.  Many of you felt unclean or afraid when you read the book, your proper response was repentance and faith towards God. You then would have been doubly blessed, rather than depending on some past commitment you made.  Wake up people 
 Not only does this film was exquisitely made for a different audience by Disney, but they were able to capture the real message implicitly stated in Carrol's book; here, we are able to succumb into the fantastic wonderlands brought upon by psychedelics, and more often than not, one is constantly reminded about the useless games and parodies we set ourselves with on a daily basis. Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind. Most importantly, I believe, is to watch this film under a preferred state of consciousness as to better appreciate the subtle messages the producers wanted to put across, and luckily, by the end of the film, you can ask yourself: Who am I? 
 I am a huge fan of Bands that let us see behind the scenes of making their music.  MTV videos are fine, but what I want is the real people doing what they love, not some made up show, which is what most music videos turn out like.  I really like this DVD mainly because it did exactly what I hoped it would, gave me a look at the muscians making their music in an intimate way. The video from shows and making the album are super great, and I understand Blind Melon a little more now due to this DVD.  
 What a breath of fresh air this book is. Perez manages to tread the fine line between theory and practise with grace. A great survey of filmmakers and film theory alike. Gilberto Perez' personal style makes for a very acessible text, and he doesn't shy away from 'unpopular' rejections of theory he disagrees with.  An extremely valuable resource for students of film that helps to make sense of the often complicated threads of film theory 
 Just about everyone has hit on the sound quality issues, so I'm not going to beat that dead horse.  I give the music five stars though.  This is not a happy album.  It is dark and gritty as can be.  Very simple, very effective.  There are a ton of great songs on here, a lot of morality tales that define the word timeless.  Dylan's weary voice more than fits the tone of the album.  "I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine" is one of my favorite Dylan tunes of all time.  It never fails to send a shiver down my spine.  Everybody knows "Watchtower" because of Hendrix's version, but Dylan's isn't shabby.  And it blends in perfectly with "Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest".  More of a dialogue between of two men then an actual song, it is very open to interpretation (but then again, what Dylan song isn't?).  Easily one of Dylan's best albums, and a must own for fans of Dylan and fans of music in general.  
 Fantastic book to read for anyone with PCOS. Gave a great insight into PCOS and how to manage it. 
 I am so pleased I was given this book, because I doubt I would have picked it up myself.  I won't be passing it on as I know I'll re-read it in a few months.  It was easy to read, gripping and totally unexpected. I hadn't read anything by Victoria Taylor Murray before, but I am definitely going to buy her back catalogue and future books.  There are plenty of reviews here which give you an outline of the plot, but rather than repeating them I'd suggest if you haven't read anything by this author before, this book is a good place to start.   
 I read this book in fifth grade once for a book report.  Once you get into it, you can put it down.  It is about a Navaho girl who's mother gave her a flock of sheep.  Then two Spanish Slavers come and take then away.  When they escape, they take some horses and start to arrive back to their village.  Then the Long Knives come and burn down their land and take them away.  You will have to read the rest of it to find out what happens. I think this is a great book to read anytime. 
 This book will inevitably draw comparisons with the Beatles Anthology, because it came out at the same time, and it is not as good as that book. But it is still the best account of the Rolling Stones career from the people that matter - the Stones themselves. It IS rose-tinted - as you'd expect -  but the wealth of information in there more than makes up for it. Plus, you've got accounts from other parties - like the guy who booked them into the Crawdaddy Club at the start of their career. The book has a wealth of those - something the Beatles book was sorely lacking. If I have one major complaint, then it's at the pictures. There are simply not enough of them. And the ones that are included aren't all that great. 
 Wonderful, wonderful music. Hard to say which track would be my favorite, as that changes from time to time (they are all very good). I suppose I find myself returning most often to Diana's cover of "Black Crow".  Highly recommended 
 This is a fantastic ethnography that breathes life into the stuffy literature on youth sexuality. The fact that it was done in China makes it even more interesting and impressive. Paying respect to the critiques of post-modernists, Farrer nicely places himself within the ethnography as a participant in the field of interaction. Furthermore his view of his data as "stories" through which participants are not revealing the reality of their lives but rather positioning themselves in social space and understanding contemporary China, is a brilliant move that is both fascinating and gets beyond many of the problems of validity in ethnography. Finally, Farrer took his scholarly analysis one step beyond most sociological work insofar as he drove the concepts into the structure of the book and the analysis. They receded into the background, resulting in jargon-free prose that is accessible to non-specialists and students as well as professional sociologists. This is one of those rare books that I will be able to assign to my undergraduates and enjoy myself. I wish more sociologists would produce this type of scholarship 
 Reading this in 2005, I was suprised how much was relevant to our current "religious" beleifs and political climate....  One would thing Tolstoy had forseen the Mega chuchs of Dallas, TEXAS.. 
 When this mini-series aired on Masterpiece Theatre back in 1983, it captured my interest from the very start.  As a single parent, I could barely wait for Sunday evenings to roll around for the next episode, not  just to relax, but revel in the beauty of this story.  The candor with  which the historical events (both positive and negative) surrounding  Elspeth Huxley's early life in Africa is displayed is both refreshing and  heartwarming.  I wish every child could experience growing up in a world  such as little Elspeth did.  As a previous reviewer remarked, this story  was indelibly inscribed upon my mind and heart---I have never forgotten it  throughout the years, although I strain to remember other stories and  movies I have seen.  Even the haunting movie score comes to mind more often  than not.  Since that first viewing, I have borrowed it from my local  public library and I now plan to purchase the set for my personal video  library.  I highly recommend this movie--it is one you'll not soon forget 
 All too often we walk by things that are true wonders.  Yes, we need to slow down, stop, and smell the flowers, but how many of us stop and think about how wonderful the manmade structures are that we use every day?  This story of the Brooklyn Bridge shows just how marvelous is that bridge - from its conception through its actual construction and dedication.  It's all here: political intrigue, official corruption, flights of inventive genius, family drama, danger, and the list could go on.  As alluded to in the title I chose for this review, this book should be read by anyone contemplating project management, because there are so many lessons here for folks who want to keep a project moving in the right direction.  I give this book 5 stars because it is a marvelous story about a monumental construction 
 The Night of the Hunter is an old story and movie, but is a page turner as of today.  Very exciting and intriguing 
 This move inspired me when I was a little to become spiritual. I always remember watching it on TV when growing up. I have written my own book that is on amazon and I feel this movie gave me the inspiration to do that and to try and understand God.   My book is "Happy Birthday Mr Sidney" and it is getting 5 star reviews here on Amazon. WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT DURING YOUR DEATH, WE DO NOT REGRET OUR LIFE".  
 Collecting the final four issues of Grant Morrison's already legendary run on New X-Men, Here Comes Tomorrow brings everything that Morrison has set up over the past couple years to a close.  Taking place 150 years after the events of Planet X, this storyarc finds Wolverine, E.V.A., a new Beak, Cassandra Nova, and a young human named Tom Skylark and his giant robot Sentinel named Rover battling over control of the Phoenix egg from the Beast.  Everything meticulous detail of Morrison's run comes full circle here, and Here Comes Tomorrow is made all the more special by featuring art by the legendary Marc Silvestri who made a name for himself drawing Marvel's merry mutants.  If you missed out on Morrison's run, go back to the beginning and read all seven volumes for proof alone that Grant Morrison is the best thing to happen to the X-Men since Chris Claremont 
 Despite being a book written 40 years ago, the delightful stories are perfect to read over and over. If you only know it as 'the book about the pet otter', it also has dozens of other little vingettes in it. Marvelous,  a classic 
 This was one of my favorite books of daniel steels, Allthough I have read quiet a few of her books, this one brung tears to my eyes at the end when her daughter finally woke up, great book 
 I'm a big fan of this book. It lays out the basics of attracting (or manifesting) whatever you desire into your life in the easiest way possible.  It is a relatively short, easy to read book with personal stories and examples that help with understanding. One thing I especially like about their teaching is that when questioned, "why do I need to do this or that", their answer is try it both ways and see which works!  They have confidence in what they say.  My favorite chapter is about creating a short, one-phrase song that states your desire clearly. (the author's is I am Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams, I am, I am, I am sung to the tune of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, but I used it to when Johnny Comes Marching Home because it fit better.) I use this exercise with my Attraction Circle classes and it is not only fun but has had great success.  Everyone seems to resonate with this idea because it is so easy and fun.  I highly recommend this book 
 This is an excellent book for anyone who has already run a marathon and is looking to improve their time. I'm not the fastest runner out there but this book was instrumental in helping me qualify for my first Boston. I have since run 3 Bostons and am able to consistently run 3:20 or so whereas before this book I was struggling for a 3:40. I am about to run Marathon #8 and I continue to use this book as a reference. The schedules are excellent, easy to follow, and broken down by peak mileage and the number of weeks you wish to commit to training. Whether you are looking for a sub 4 or a sub 2:30, there is helpful advice and a training schedule in here for you. Now all you need to do is RUN 
 Although this book is the followup to Dante's Inferno, I read it first. It is a haunting tale of black people making it to the top. The protagonist in this story is Luther Nedeed. Mr. Nedeed's family moved to Linden Hills(an area no one wanted to be associated with) made it into a funeral home, and eventually starting building cabins and renting them out. Over the years the little community grew and everybody wanted to live in Linden Hills,even the whites who wouldn't asscociate with it at first. Everyone thought that living in Linden Hills was making it, when in fact they were selling their souls for material things..................  You have to read it to find out the rest!!! Very good haunting story. Makes you wonder about your lifestyle 
 30 years after the original 2 of the greatest comedy duo's re-unite once again for another sequel. I haven't reviewed the 1st Odd Couple but I give that 5 stars also. The reason i'm reviewing this one is because it's a sequel, and normally sequels aren't very good but in this case I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Neil Simon did a great job with this script and again Lemmon & Matthau had lightning in a bottle and are brilliant in every movie they had made together. I found watching this film Lemmon & Matthau still maintained thier characters qualities quite firmly as they did 30 years prior and strongly kept thier chemistry in tact. This is a must see for not only Odd Couple fans but for Lemmon & Matthau fans, you will get a lot of laughs from this film.  
 Few Hollywood notables have been the object of more distorted,misinformed,or outright fabricated profiles than Erich Von Stroheim.Now that Arthur Lennig has come forward with his long-awaited  biography,we are finally given the amazing truth of a maverick  star/director who bit every hand that tried to feed him.Lennig has made a  serious study of Stroheim for over fifty years---he restored "Foolish  Wives" back in the sixties---he traveled to Austria to uncover the  real story of Stroheim's humble beginnings---in short,Lennig,who prevously  gave us the first and still best of the Bela Lugosi bios,has done it again  with "Stroheim"---in fact,he has surpassed himself,and that's  saying plenty considering the fact that Arthur Lennig is one of the most  well-informed and reliable of all the pioneer film historians.Has there  ever been a more fascinating(and ultimatly tragic) figure in the whole  history of Hollywood than Erich Von Stroheim?Here's a guy that took on  every front office in town---gambled it all for creative control that he  invariably lost---but kept returning to the Hollywood arena again and again  until they finally broke him.Yes,he took on the system and the system  won---or did it?Stroheim's incredible films,even in their truncated  latter-day forms,are here to give evidence that this was a director  generations ahead of his time---already it's 2000 and we still haven't  caught up with him.Read this book and get the dope on how  "Greed","The Wedding March",and all the rest came to  be. It's riveting.They should give AFI awards for books this good----it's  from University Of Kentucky Press,so I don't know how big the print run  is,but I suspect it would be a good idea to grab a copy(or  two)quick,because this one's going to end up being a collector's item 
   I learned a lot from this book.  It was very helpful to me and my customers. !!   
 Understanding the strengths an weaknesses of your competition is the key to just about any field where success is winning over someone else.  This book does an excellent job of showing how to evaluate your own strengths and limitations.  Finding un-tapped markets and finding the best strategy to tap into them is what this book is about.  The book also shows the pitfalls you can get into if you don't focus your market and market to everyone.  Highly recommended to business students as well as seasoned businessmen.  The sound basics taught in this book can improve the probability of success in your pursuits of profits.     
 This interesting book explains to children the basic life cycle of a loggerhead sea turtle. The book opens with a brief introduction explaining that a sea turtle is related to tortoises and terrapins, but they are different types of animals. After the one-page introduction, the actual story begins. We follow the life cycle of a sea turtle called Loggerhead from the time she is a small turtle living and hiding in sea weeds and drift wood to the time Loggerhead swims to the mating beaches to mate and lay her eggs. The last pages of the book include a brief index that can help teach children what an index is and how to use it. ONE TINY TURTLE is a great reading science book for young children. It's very factual and realistic in displaying and describing what we know of the life of a sea turtle (for instance, after the eggs are hatched, it makes it clear that only a few baby turtles ever make it to the ocean and the rest are eaten by crabs and birds). Highly recommended, especially for anyone who likes turtles 
 I loved this book. I really am into those old school ways for children and this is the book. I think we need to discipline this generation the way our parents did us. If your are a fan of Dr. Dobson you will like Bates too. I feel everyone could benefit from this book especially our children 
 I can not beging to tell you what this band has meant to me over the years since I was introduced to them back in the early 70's.  The hours I have spent listening to Annie Haslam's voice and the journeys it has taken me on.  The pain it has soothed.  The memories it has recalled.  On this CD "Kalynda" reminds me of a woman I once knew in my youth who got me hooked on redheads.  "Kalynda" reminds me of the love I had for her.  The twinkle in her eyes and the times we shared.  This is why this CD will always be special for me.  Thank you Annie, John, and the rest of you. Do yourself a favor and take the journey with Renaissance 
 The other reviewers have given you plenty of details about what this story is about, so I will spare you from repetition and go to the gist of my review. This book is excellent!  I read it in less than two days and had to continously interrupt my reading to tell my husband about Fauziya's trauma. I am an attorney and I have some knowledge of immigration law, but what this book revealed about the inner workings of our system appalled me.  There have been changes in our immigration system since the book was written; unfortunately, given our Country's political reaction to 9/11, those changes have probably made things even worse for refugees, particularly those of muslim backgrounds.   I applaud Fauziya, Layli, Rahuf and the rest of Fauziya's team for facing the system.  I also applaud Fauziya, Layli and all of the other contributors for undertaking the massive project of putting Fauziya's experience into a book for all to read and learn from.  I am curious as to where Fauziya is now, but given the perseverance that she lived with during her imprisonment, I am sure she is doing magnificently 
 My son really enjoyed this book for its interesting presentation of math..  he even named a cat puppet after Penrose.  
 I spent over a year convincing myself that i needed to read this book (like someone else, i was supposed to read it in class, but we didn't get to it).  Finally, I read it and I am very glad i did.  Although you can figure the secret out pretty far in advance, the fact that the narrator/investigator spends the time trying to PROVE his solution to himself shows what a marvelous work this is.  He doesn't go wildly off into the night telling anyone, he tries to get the lady to tell her husband of her own will.  the slight touch of romance, and deep sense of justice and mystery lend this book to a long weekend's worth of reading 
 This may not be a proper sort of review, but it definitely is an endorsement.  Take it from me, you should read this book! I finish about one of three novels I start. Life is too short to be wasted wading through  the semiliterate, commercial hackwork cluttering bookstore shelves (it's a  shame publishers cannot be required to turn such books back into trees). So  when a work of such high intelligence, creativity, and literary skill as  this by Thane Rosenbaum arrives, note must be taken.  I won't try to  describe this book, because other reviewers have done so as well as or  better than I could. But don't linger over the reviews - run and get the  book!  You will be entertained and enlightened, and finally encouraged by  the realization that there may still be writers among us 
 There is no other story told and re-told as much as P&P.  This book transcends many generations with a true and tested story.  The characters and story line are so similiar to this day and age.  Austen's poetic writing gives readers a sense of the social times as well as insight to each character's thoughts.  I read this book every year and see all the movies based on it.  Love it, love it, love it 
 East of Eden by John Steinbeck is just about as good as it gets.  This story features the classic battle of good vs. evil.    Adam Trask represents the good while the woman he falls in love with is the epitome of evil.  Now this should not ruin the story for you, nor provide any hidden insight, as Mr. Steinbeck tells a truly remarkable story; leaving little to the imagination.  From the birth of one character, and her intitial label as a monster, to the evocative descriptions of a barren landscape; Mr. Steinbeck is at the peak of writing prowess.    This book is well-worth the time investment necessary to read it.  Once done, however, the end result is well worth it.  The characters in this book will stay with you.  
 Gripping from the first pages.  Don't start this until you have a pretty good chunk of time available.  You won't want to need to put the book down.  Elaine Garret 
 For those interested in cinematic homosexuality, this book is simply a must-have!  Composed with a liberal touch of arch lingua franca, the volume is toned and textured with as many gossipy asides, innuendos, and double entendres as the films discussed.  The subject is dealt a much lighter hand than Vito Russo allotted its predecessor, The Celluloid Closet.  Richard Barrios is utterly tickled pink at his discoveries, where Russo often seems to chafe.  Even those familiar with the torturous course of outre theater will detect tidbits previously unperceived, and those not in-the-know will probably be astonished at pre-Production Code permissiveness regarding the depiction of fey/butch images.  More remarkable is the under-the-radar, Code-busting bomblettes that went unsensed by the censors--and were subsequently reviled (or reveled in) by trade reviewers.  A tad too much quill is sharpened criticizing fluffy, Day-class sixties comedies, when such goose down is found in every film era.  (At least the author can be commended for not reading too much into Calamity Jane--or any other feature, for that matter.  After all, a lesbian cult movie does not a lesbian movie make!)  Barrios could also have refrained from the occasional canard regarding sexual orientation origins and Biblical history.  Overall, though, this substantial book sticks solidly to the subject, examining numerous films (including shorts and cartoons) and their interrelationship with the political establishment and popular culture.  Included are over 50 crisp photos and several vignette-bios.  The prose has a fabulous flow that makes for a thoroughly enjoyable read and should hold the attention of anyone interested in the screen/society circle 
 This is a great book by a student of the market 
 Let's be honest, the latter half of the 20th century has produced only a handful of important works of philosophy. This is certainly one of them. For those of us who were students of philosophy in the early eighties,  toiling away in the less-than-abundant vineyards of the analytical  tradition, this book came as a revelation and a liberation 
 A thirteen-year old boy named Kyle thought spending a vacation along the Oregon Coast with his family would be a great experience. He'd never flown before and he'd never seen the beautiful Pacific Ocean.  Kyle's perfect vacation becomes his worst nightmare while he's baby-siting his six-year old sister Bee Bee. An earthquake hits the coast and starts an enourmous fire in his hotel he's staying in. While fighting his way smoke and flame, Kyle had remembered seeing a sign on the beach that stated....After an earthquake everyone should go uphill and inland, as far from the ocean as possible. Tsunamis' giant waves that often follow through earthquakes can ride in from the sea and engulf anyone who doesn't escape fast enough!  
 This is a good CD that is enjoyable to listen to. The songs are interesting. I love the remake of Melanie's hit, "Brand new key" 
 I loved the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes. In the story Sadako loves to run. She ran in the relay race. Then she felt dizzy spells.She kept them a secret.The dizziness came from the radiation from the bomb. Then Sadako got leukemia and she was preparing for death. From reading this story I learned that when you are less fortunate, your life is harder like Sadako's.  When you are fighting for your life, you seem hopeless, but there is always hope.  After reading the story, I felt sad because Sadako fought for her life and she died a hero.  I would recommend this book to a best friend because it is a good book about hope. 
 Fun book to listen to when you want company while doing mundane chores around the farm!  Kept me enticed along the way 
 Wonderful book and seller. Thank you!!                        Joa 
 I am starting an electrical contracting business and needed help with the office/legal side of the business. I read 4 books on starting a business. This book was the most practical and relavent for me as it was written specifically for the contractor trades. This book provides a good overview of the business details that are required for a business to operate and succeed. It contains very practical examples of what to do to before you start your company and as you run your company. Buy this book first and you may not want any others. Good job with this book Jim 
 My results were fabulous. With that said, I was suffering from a back injury. By doing the movement prep only, I was able to return to my previous athletic conditioning. However, I am not a pro athlete and never will be competitive in the sports that I do (bicycling and running) 
 I loved this shoppers guide.  It took all the guesswork out of shopping for my health.  I also purchased "The Maker's Diet" book by Jordan Rubin and loved it as well.  It gave me the opportunity to understand the motivation and the "why" behind the food which helps me make it personal in my life.  I recommend this to anyone wanting more energy and a healthier lifestyle. The shoppers guide is easy to read, small enough to take to the grocery store and thorough.  I also loved the recipies.  
 This book has a great variety of martini recipes - I'm usually a fan of basic dirty martinis, but there are so many options for interesting drinks in here, I'm looking forward to branching out and trying them all. It's a great book to use if you're throwing a party, since there are drinks in every color, flavor, and for every season. So far I've tried the Pineapple Champagne martini, which was really good. The book also has a ton of really beautiful photos. 
 Book is very well written (translated) and maintains the feel of Olde English and the references to God (unusual these days). Though it includes only a few of the tales and is sparsely illustrated, my children love to hear the stories and we love to read them. It is an exceptional introduction to Canterbury and the time period, for around ages 7-10 
 I saw this group Live 3 times, and their attack of heavy rock was phenomenal. Also saw Black Sabbath when they were out here in 1975, and there was really no comparison. If Buffalo would've had a promotion & touring program put together properly, they would've been as big as Sabbath & Slade, not too far behind Zeppelin. Listen to this & feel just raw energy. Takes me back to when Rock was ROCK.. 
 Both "Wall Street" and "Boiler Room" have the same moral outline. In both movies, young, ambitious, and smart individuals are looking to make an enormous amount of money in the quickest time possible. Both are doing it on the stock market. Both want to make their fathers proud, and both quickly learn that the only way to get the fast "wall street" money is to get it illegally. Once they realize they are committing crimes, they do it anyway. Then, of course, comes a braking point. Both movies open with shots of New-York city. Only in the "Boiler Room", the soundtrack is rap music. That shows us the evolution of time since  "Wall Street" came out. Well, the tastes in music changed, that's for sure, but no change occurred in human nature. "Greed is good", said Gordon Gekko. Greed still reigns supreme in "Boiler Room".  The love story does not end anywhere in "Boiler Room". In this story, the love interest is not a whore and does not like him for the money. And she really needs the job. In this movie, she is a positive character, whereas in "Wall Street", the love interest is a negative character.   Also, in both movies, we do not see the main characters really enjoying their new found wealth. Yeah, Bud Fox did buy a nice apartment, but we never see him free of worry, free of self-doubt and guilt. The same applies for Seth.  Vin Diesel, an excellent actor, ads flavor to the movie, along with Jamie Kennedy and a bunch of other young actors trying to prove themselves. Ben Affleck is in the movie too, although you only see him once or twice and the movie could have gone on without him. That's too bad. I don't know why he agreed to such a mediocre part.   Overall, an enjoyable, easy to follow movie. Not as glamorous, not as flashy, but gets the point across. However, not able to surpass "Wall Street" 
 Suba produced Bebel Gilberto's acclaimed album "Tanto Tempo",and did his own solo work "Sao Paulo Confessions" before his untimely passing in 1999.He was on the verge of the millenium;he had much potential."Tributo" is a worthy tribute to his work on "Sao Paulo Confessions".In some ways,it is superior to "Confessions" but also shows,tragically,how much talent was lost.  There are three brief live concert duets between Suba&Joao Parahyba called "Futuro Primitivo." One can understand the audience's enthusiasm.  Cibelle sings on two great tracks "Sereia"&"Tantos Desejos." It's no wonder Cibelle has succeeded in solo work.Zero dB reconstructs :Samba do Gringo Paulista" into a tribute to Brazil."Lagoa Pinheiros" is delightfully mysterious."Are you sleeping?" is perfect music for a '60s era "space age" lounge.Phil Asher's remix of "Voce Gusta" is jazzy.This album is perfect for those who enjoy Brazilian lounge music;this is perfect for chilling 
 This was one of, if not the funniest sci-fi book I have ever read. It is also one of the easier reads I have read, however it being easy to read doesn't take away from the plot and the overall randomness of the "Hitchhiker" books (which I strongly recommend you read all of). Douglas Adams has created a masterpiece which will captivate even beginning readers will want to read this book because of the lack of hard words and fast paced plot line full of action and oddities. Here is a brief summary of what the book is about. However, don't be discouraged from reading the book because you think you know all that happened, the summary doesn't give more away then what you learn in the first few chapters.  	This book depicts Arthur Dent -a normal earthling- going about his morning when he notices a bulldozer in front of his house and lies down in the mud in front of it so it won't demolish his house. Then his friend Ford Prefect -an alien from the Betelgeuse star system- wisks him away from earth (about to be destroyed by the Vogons) by hitchhiking on a Vogon ship. Then he and Arthur travel all around the universe in search of the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything. On the way he meets Zaphod Beeblebrox -the crazy president of the galaxy- and Trillian -Zaphod's girlfriend from earth- who join Ford and Arthur in their quest to find the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything. 	If you are intrigued by the brief summary I have just given you, then this book is for you, and if you were not, well then just read it anyway and you will probably find something to laugh at and enjoy. REMEMBER, DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT BEING TOO HARD the words are simple and you should understand all or most of them. So for all of you who like a nice easy read go ahead and dive into the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. For those more sophisticated readers out there you will love the complex themes Douglas Adams weaves into his book (but you beginning readers can just ignore them and still pretty much get what the book is talking about. 
 Talvhin Singh. Buy this, and help find your spiritual center 
 This is the best book I have yet read on the Hanssen tragedy. It is good, and worth reading. Continue reading THIS to hear about the book's shortcomings.  The book is not consistently chronologically structured. Good biographies begin with the subject's birth and progress on a straight time-line. This book does so only tenuously.  The author's access to information about this case would have enabled him to provide far more information than he did about what Hanssen actually betrayed to the Soviets/Russians. This could have been provided in an appendix if not the text itself, and it would not have betrayed national security. For example: The interviews with Heinrich Muller of the Gestapo reveal an exact transcript of Roosevelt and Churchill's discussion of the Pearl Harbor attack - BEFORE it happened. There is nothing like that here, simply statements like "The KGB wanted information about missiles. Hanssen gave them a report recently produced by the CIA on the topic." There is nothing about what that report contained, or its implications for national security.   The description provided of Hanssen's sexual perversion is excessive. Some very graphic descriptions of Bob Hanssen's marital sexual activities are given; these will only continue to haunt Hanssen's wife. It would have been quite adequate to simply state that Hanssen's behavior included a raging libido. Doing this would have kept the focus upon Hanssen's espionage.  The analysis of Hanssen's personality is inadequate. Special Agent Hanssen held very conservative ideas and was a deeply religious man during his career as a spy. He was also an outright "enemy of Communism." Hanssen used to say things like "if you don't have Christ in your life you'll never get anywhere." I would like to know how Hanssen would rectify his "religion" with his treason. The author puts forth no effort whatsoever to explain how these contradictions could have resulted in Hanssen becoming an ally of the KGB (and its successor). The author does mention Hanssen's psychiatrists, and their evaluation of Hanssen as having repressed childhood conflicts. That is simply not enough.   Finally: The summary provided of the Hanssen debacle seems inadequate. The treason Hanssen performed was an example of a cultural mutation that reflects poorly upon us all. I'm talking about human dignity, honor, and the lack of it nowadays. Hanssen's espionage did not bring about the revulsion (or punishment) that would seem to naturally befit such a crime. I find it ironic that it happened in the same era where adultery is so commonplace that it is hardly noticed. If he had been caught at the same time as the Rosenbergs, Hanssen would have been executed "as soon as the chair was empty." But now he gets to live on our tax dollars? He gets to see his family? This book explains how Hanssen's lawyer negotiated to avoid the death penalty for his client. I believe the Supreme Court could have overridden that argument. They could have sent Hanssen to his death, and they should have. That is not the way things are now, however. It doesn't matter what crime a person does, it matters how skillful their lawyer is. David Wise could have made a strong statement about what that signals for our future, and he should have.  It's a good book tho'!     
 I love this book, and its definitely become one of my bibles, along with How to Cook Everything and (for my pressure cooker) Pressure Perfect.  I have a huge collection of cookbooks and I would say that this one falls into the category of creative home cuisine, as opposed to restaurant-based food, ethnic food, or categorized foods (sautes, braises, stews, etc).  She has such an interesting and flavor-based approach to cooking that it will be hard to think of food in the same way after you have read a few chapters and attempted a few recipes.  The book is designed for people who love to improvise in the kitchen, and its recipes establish the basic building blocks that allow the home cook to pick and choose the ingredients s/he wants to combine.  Sally also includes her favorites, for fool-proof results, and recommendations for where to buy some of the more exotic ingredients (after reading her chapter on salads I rushed out and bought a bottle of Vinaigre De Banyuls, a 50 yr old sherry vinegar, and a properly aged balsamic.  It makes a huge difference in a salad, and now I know that proper vinegar has as complex a taste as fine wine).  Like John Ash's Cooking One on One, this is not a book about convenience or how to use every leftover ingredient in your pantry, but about how to make simple food that is fresh, clean, and tastes great.  If its not worth it to you to spend a dollar on a pint of whole milk or cream every once in a while, you won't get your money's worth.  But if you want a foundation for flavorful home cooking, this book is fantastic 
 The art in Der Mond is excellent. I would say this is a must have for any Evangelion fan 
 Tom Peters is a gift to this generation.  He has taken subjects that have been blown out of proportion and brought them to manageable levels.  By doing this, he has created an environment where the common business person can provide and take advantage of exceptional products and services.  The concepts he develops are easily tracked to texts developed across the years.  The illustrations and examples of these are straight from every day life and are a part of what everyone has seen.  After placing normal activities into the text book complexity and removing the shackles of academia, he is able to ask, "why doesn't everyone do this?"  There are no answers to that question, only actions to be performed 
 Very easy book for an 8 yr old to read. Much info and pictures 
 Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. I bought this book to read on a flight from the UK to Australia and it had me laughing so loud I was quite an embarrassment! I'm not a 'chick lit' kind of girl but this was a real exception. As an author myself I really admire the talent it takes to write a book where almost every line makes you smile or laugh. Pure escapism, very charming and such good fun, and somehow it also manages to be a book which makes you take stock of what really counts in life. This should be compulsory reading for every workaholic - and certainly every lawyer. Enjoy 
 A classic of sociological thought, and one of the best (if not the best) accounts on the purpose and tasks of sociological mindset. Sociological imagination (or perspective, if you will) as intersection of biography and history - pure and simple, yet succinctly incisive and elegantly descriptive. Still a very relevant, influential and timely text for each and all. 
 Shipwrecked and held captive by Muslim slavers, this true story is so well written and researched and the story so unbelieveable it is difficult to put down. I have deliberately not read the ending because I don't want the experience to end.  With every step that these brave souls take through the unforgiving desert and the treatment they receive, because they are Christians and therefore "dog dung" is beyond human endurance. Their story of survival and their belief in their salvation is the best book I have ever read of this genre.  I am grateful to the author for giving me this life altering experience 
 As an author on psychic vampirism myself, I know the challenges of tackling this complex and contraversial subject matter - especially when writing from a point of view sympathetic to the vampire. Raven Kaldera attacks the topic head-on, daring to delve into territory that many others have shied away from.   Kaldera, an author who has established himself as someone who does not flinch away from touchy subjects and cultural taboos, brings his usual clear, sensible, and sometimes blunt style to the table, offering practical wisdom for those individuals who are struggling to come to terms with their psychic vampirism. In a community that is often rife with politics, Kaldera takes no sides, instead presenting the material simply as he has observed and experienced it for himself. He supplements his own research and insights into the vampiric condition with interviews with other psychic vampires -- several of them fairly well-known. An added bonus is that these are vampires who themselves are known to have radically different approaches to the topic, and so the reader gets a full-spectrum view on values, practices, and personal experiences.  What I liked best about this work is the fact that Kaldera does not brush under the rug topics like sexuality, blood-drinking, and even parenting. The spiritual and magickal aspects of being a psychic vampire are adequately served, but the practical day-to-day concerns are also given their due.   In all, this is a balanced and coherent text, one I will be recommending to my own readers as a must-have for their shelves.  (... 
 This is old-school journalism at its best.  Hofmann takes the year as it comes, and, journal style, writes a few sketches every month.  Having lived in Rome for thirty years, he knows a lot about it, and he draws on his wealth of information, memory, impressions, and connections to give vivid pictures of the holidays that roll around or reflections prompted by chance events. His range is delightful -- from the pope to Vespa-riding robbers, from diplomats to gypsies, from horse shows to opera, from the mafia to the gattare [stray cat feeders]. If he needs statistics, he knows how to get them and unobtrusively adds them. He is not coy about using addresses, so I read with a map.  I knew little about Rome when I began this book, but by the end I felt I knew where things were, what the flavor of the city is.  It's not a travel guide, it's deep background for a visit 
 There are only two other horror anthologies that I think are better than this one, and those two really ARE classics (THE DARK DESCENT and GREAT TALES OF TERROR AND THE SUPERNATURAL)  Not only are the stories in this  anthology very good, but offer a very wide variety of horror tales.  Many  different "flavors" of terror are available in this collection,  from nice suspensful terror, to really visceral horror at something  unspeakable occurring, to the completely physical revulsion to seeing a  living mammal pulped in a feed thresher.  Nice touch, that.  There are  vampires and Things Out of Time, possession tales and Mysterious Strangers.   My favorites included: a short gothic horror novel  ("Murgunstrumm" by Hugh B. Cave), Lumley's Lovecraftian "The  House of the Temple", a real gem by Ramsey Campbell ("Out of  Copyright") that ought to make the most jaundiced reader of horror  think a little whenever s/he thumbs open a familiar text, and a simply  AWESOME story by Lisa Tuttle ("The Horse Lord"). Rober Bloch's  "Yugoslaves" shows why he's a master, and "The  Jumpity-Jim" by R. Chetwyd-Hayes is a pretty nasty little tale.  These  are just the very best of the stories there; all of them are pretty good.   Stephen Laws' "Junk" deserves mention as well.  Jeesh.  "The  Black Drama" might give away its punchline a bit too soon, but it  still provides some nice pulpy entertainment.  All in all, this collection  EARNS its 11 bucks worth of chills 
 This book is like having someone hold your hand as you accept the news that someone you love is gay.  It is written by parents who share what were their reactions, questions and fears upon learning that their son or daughter is gay.  Is is my fault?  What will the neighbors think?  What will my church think?  The book presents parent's own answers to these questions and refers to current outside writing on the subjects addressed.  It's "must read" for anyone trying to understand homosexuality, coming-out and how to best understand and love someone who is ga 
 That's just it- I love this product, and I am so happy that we purchased it.  It saves time and space, and is very safe for my children.  We bought 2, one for each of my children- and they have been wonderful 
 I am a big fan of the classic monsters and monster movies. Interestingly, I am so without having seen any of them, practically! I mainly know them from later movies, from comic books, and from books. (I read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, for instance.)  So I jumped at the chance when I found out of a great opportunity to get a whole bunch of the most classic monster movies at once on DVD, and even at a excellent price. It has  three or four Frankenstein movies, and the same for Dracula and Wolf Man. It also has small busts of those three gentlemen, in surprisingly fine quality.  This is the MONSTER LEGACY COLLECTION.  If you can get it, I recommend the UK edition, which has four extra films, The Mummy, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Phantom of the Opera, and The Invisible Man. It is not quite as easy to find, but I found it at Blah DVD.  I don't know why I, like many people, have such an affinity for monsters. They just be weally weally cool.  What is a monster? Is it an evil creature or person? Is it a deformed creature/person? Is it something inhuman? I am not sure what the basic of it is. But at least this collection is a good start to any research. : 
 This book was so good, I used it in my wedding 
 It was a good story, and I have horses so it was fun 
 This disc is a special treat in my opinion.  I couldn't disagree more with his political talk here and I agree with some others that it's not appropriate in the venue.  I will however grant that he has to right to express himself as he chooses, when he wants to.  Taken on the scope of his entire career I wish I had just a fingernail full of his songwriting and singing talent.  I have listened to, played and, been comforted by his music since the begining of his career.  I'm particularly pleased that he released "The Birds of St. Marks", as I have been haunted by that tune since I saw him do it on the Disney special on Showtime, I believe it was.  One of his best ever!  As far as people getting on him about some of his personal affairs, I wonder how they would feel if the lense was focused on them?  We've all done things we're not proud of.  I met him in a grocery store years ago and he was charming. I think he is a gracious and talented performer, one of our best, and his body of work speaks for itself. 
 Previous reviewers here have touched most of the bases. This is a meander, not a nail-biter. It reminds me of one of the Sprawling Robert Altman films like "Nashville" with numerous characters and set pieces strung loosely together.   Sterling occasionally seems to be trying to show how witty he is. But I found much to enjoy in this book.  One pleasure, a cyber-punk mainstay, is utter confidence in the wordplay depicting the fabulous computer networks of a future world, with wearable super-power communication hardware, etc.   I appreciated, actually, that the story took more interest in its amusing characters than in plot development to some sort of climax. That said, there is occasional action and excitement. It's true the central Mia / Maya character wasn't deeply drawn, but I liked her and her adventurous spirit.   Altogether a fun, light read that made me think a bit. 
 I bought for my daughter and I like them, but they were not exactly what she had in mind 
 Italy the beautiful contains all of the classic Italian recipes. They are concise and easy to follow and written with Americans in mind. Everything I've cooked from vegatables to major main courses are delicious and maybe more importantly, the dishes look like the photographs 
 What do you expect more Clash? Naw! This album fuses rap/rock/electronica/dance wrapped into one party album. Don't expect the worlds best, but dudes, have it in the collection just in case you have those types o people back after the club 
 A creative twist on learning the alphabet. My children all really enjoy this book. It has bright, vivid colors. We used this book a lot during our teacher education classes as well. It is seen as a classic and enjoyed by children. 
 The book has some really well thought-out entries and some excellent resource material.  Of course, as with any reference book, this book will be out-dated in a year or so 
 I am an avid reader and I must say that I've read my share of great books but this one is among the best ever. Watch out Janette Oke! Ruth Ellinger will surely be a best seller. BUY THIS BOOK!! A real page turner 
 my wife has always talked about this movie she saw when she was still young. she was not sure what the title was but remembered that it was a musical about a girl and a pirate prince and that the songs were very good. wanting to please her, i've made it my mission to find "that movie". the search obviously started in video stores, yard sales, and friends. i discovered amazon while looking for books about airguns. and, lo and behold! there was a video section so i checked it out. the rest, as they say is history. i'm a happy man with a very happy wife 
 When my daughter saw me reading this book she exclaimed, "Don't you know everything about Babe Ruth already?" Well, even if I thought I did, this book made me aware of how little I knew. I had read most of the previous biographies from Tom Meany's to Robert Creamer's. But Leigh Montville's book is the last word on Ruth. What an enormous amount of research he put in, yet he did not let the material overwhelm his subject. The Babe comes through in living color. I don't think any player has ever captured the imagination of the American public more or has been treated more shabbily by the sport he enhanced. I think one reason that Babe Ruth continues to be the gold standard to baseball fans is because, unlike the spoiled players of today who make millions of dollars a year and charge for an autograph, Babe loved being "Babe Ruth." He made appearances for kids, he autographed baseballs, he autographed $20 bills. He gave as much as he received both on and off the field.  I especially liked the way Montville used interviews from other players to bring Babe to life. One of the most poignant passages in the book describes Babe's last game in Pittsburgh. Montville tells the story from the points of view of the opposing pitchers. The Pirates' pitchers thought Babe was washed up and were planning how they were going to pitch to him. One of Babe's former teammates warns them to pitch around him, but they don't listen. Babe hit three home runs in that games. The book is filled with jewels like this.  There are people who do research. And there are people who  write well. But not too many can put the package together. Leigh Montville hits a grand slam here 
 Again, a must read for any professional considering or seeking a new opportunity in the job market. I feel it was extremely helpful in clarifying what I am seeking in my career so I could decide what to pursue and, more critical, what not to pursue.  If you feel you do not have the time or inclination to read the entire book, then completing the Flower Exercise in the appendix will be the most worthwhile investment you can spend on your career 
  `Hollywood Goes to War" is the biography of a federal government agency, the Office of War Information (1942-45.)  The OWI - not to be confused with the OSS, OGR, OCD or any other agency in that alphabet-soup happy era - was a creation of the Roosevelt Administration whose purpose was to control the message contained in American movies during the duration.  In other words, it was a propaganda agency which, as authors Koppes and Black explain in the preface, issued instruction manuals to the studios, sat in on story conferences, reviewed screenplays, pressured studios to change scripts and even scrap pictures, and sometimes even wrote dialogue for key speeches.  Politicians, even in a democracy that prides itself on its tolerance of free speech, aren't above trying to spin a message now and then.  Spinning is usually done as covertly as possible.  World War II was seen as a `total' war, though, and controlling the content of Hollywood movies (employing , as they put it, a `strategy of truth') was seen as a necessity.  One of the chapter titles phrase the problem succinctly enough; Will this movie help us win the war?  OWI was created to arbitrate and answer that question.    Of course, the demands of propaganda are different than those of mass entertainment, and HGtW offers a few surprising battles.  None more so, perhaps, than OWI's strong reaction against Preston Sturges' frothy screwball masterpiece, 1942's Palm Beach Story, a movie HGtW quotes an OWI reviewer characterizing as "a fine example of what should not be made in the way of escape pictures."  Palm Beach Story's transgression seems to have been that it didn't take the war quite seriously enough.  The idle rich spent money with frivolous abandon, distressed lovers ignored the war and its issues.  It seems reasonable enough that OWI would squash movies verging too close to such socially realistic topics as gangsterism, draft dodging, labor unrest, racial conflict, and any number of other ills.  It's the inoffensive domestic movies that OWI objected to that make HGtW so fascinating.  Still, there was a war to be won and movies were a great medium for getting The Message out.  That the heavy, heavy hand of a governmental agency might kill whatever value the messenger had seemed to have been ignored now and then.  Another area of burning interest to OWI was the depiction of our allies.  Not surprisingly OWI loved the movie `Mission to Moscow' ("...the most notorious example of propaganda in the guise of entertainment ever produced by Hollywood ") and Keys to the Kingdom, a movie which, as Koppes and Black put it, "reflected the Roosevelt administration's propaganda needs, which in turns were based on a blend of ignorance, apathy, and optimism about the real situation."  The critics hated them, too.  Besides movies about our allies, the home front and combat war movies, OWI worried over the depiction of the enemy.  In this case the Germans and the Japanese.  With an eye to the post-war world OWI preferred that the typical German was seen as a separate entity from the German ruling elite.  The Japanese, the beast in the jungle, were more or less a lost cause.  OWI loved Darryl Zanuck's ambitious and expensive `Wilson,' which presented a glowing and humanizing portrait of Woodrow Wilson, the martyr to the dream of the League of Nations.  The message in this case was the need for a league of nations in the post-war world.  The result was an expensively mounted yawn fest that is practically unwatchable.   As someone who watches a lot of old movies, I enjoyed Hollywood Goes to War quite a bit.  Any book about managed information in the form of government propaganda is bound to raise disturbing issues, and to their credit Koppes and Black present their story clearly without undue editorializing.  Anyone who's a fan of American movies made during World War II will find this book educational and entertaining.     
 My Dad who died in 2001 served in WWII in the Navy. He rarely talked about his service; however, he did tell me how difficult his job was to deliver Marines to fight at Iwo Jima.  Bradley's book and now Eastwood's movie make me very proud of my Dad.  He along with the thousands who served in the Pacific Theater were all heros 
 15 Minutes is worth the money.  It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time.  This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life.  We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today.   At the center of the movie's plot is a greedy, slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders, as they are being committed.  He has a moral pause, only for a second, before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world.  The rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them.  All in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money. 
 While the title sounds like a mystery novel or a "Made for TV Movie", the book is a dynamic powerhouse of this previously neglected part of Crowley's life.  It details not only his personal use of the talking board, but also his willingness to teach responsible people how to use it with great effect and safety.  The book is written by, and largely for ceremonial magicians by Red Flame member, J. Edward Cornelius.  While it is helpful for traditions outside of the OTO, it is tailored to be used in that magickal context and it's traditional methods.  It is not an exposure of their practices, but rather how to plug that into traditions of the Golden Dawn, OTO, Gnostic Catholic Church, et al..it is not a book for conspiracy theorists!  The books one fault is that it takes a patronizing approach to Wicca and witchcraft throughout its contents.  But by letting that go, it does give a very useful approach to using the board for spirit commincation, and makes clear the potential for harm that comes with the board. I highly reccomend it for Crowley fans, divination enthusist, and the witch and magician at large 
 Delightful.  Hits the spot the way a big ol' spoonful of cookie dough does.  Yum.  Sweet, cute, sexy, but also some serious reflections on the lives of modern women and girls.  And surprisingly, the real love story of a woman and her Best Girlfriend, much more than the story of a woman and a man.  Fun, bright, charming, witty, and deeply nice in a totally-not-sarcastic-or-snide way. 
 The late Prof. Carroll Quigley,of Georgetown University taught former President Bill Clinton ALL he knows-or so said Clinton at the 1992 Democratic convention.I've had this book for 30 years and its contents NEVER fail to amaze me.If yiu want to know the truth about the Cecil RHOADS sociey,Clinton was a member,or the anglophile Council on Foreign Relations(CFR),Bill was a menber of it too,READ THIS BOOK.Prof Quigley,who died in 1978,was an insiders' insider,he also had an influence on the late Sen. Joe McCarthy.The author of this review is very much a leftists 
 Without any doubt, the mental training exercises found inside this great book are the best....period ! This is a must to anyone who aspire to harness the real power behind its own mind.   Buy it...you'll be grateful you di 
 A very profound, solid and informative book! Grant, one of the best connoisseurs of medieval science, takes a long overdue step against the conservative mainstream in the field of the history of science; i.e. he corrects the absurd fairy tale of the invention of modern science through "great heroes" like Galileo, Descartes, Newton etc. by showing the great merits of medieval thinkers: The roots of modern science were planted in the medieval world long before the alleged "Scientific Revolution" of the seventeenth century.   This fundamental insight was recently confirmed through the book of Ulrich Taschow: "Nicole Oresme und der Frühling der Moderne", ISBN 3-936979-00-6, see Amazon german ("Nicole Oresme and the spring of modern age"). Taschow supplements his very interesting examinations of history of science through a psycho-historical approach including a new theory of evolutionary consciousness. In medieval thought the basic elements of Modern Age were anticipated by means of "self-fulfilling prophecies" - for Taschow a psycho-historical principle of consciousness. Grants emphasis of the medieval "thought experiment" as essential step into modern science Taschow similarly uses as one of the essential functions of the modern consciousness, etc. In different languages both authors speak of the same things.   So I think it is no chance that two totally different ways and methods, Grants and Taschows, led to the same results! In this respect it would be very interesting to know Grants "beliefs" in the structure of historical processes. Obviously he is no follower of the conservative theory of linear, cumulative progress... (or?)  For people which are interested in deeper questions and answers concerning the origins of Modern Science and Modern Western Culture beyond the commonplaces of classical history I strongly recommend both books, Grants and Taschows.

 Redmann's character development and plot were excellent.  I could not put the book down. It's a true page turner that has you guessing and surprised around every corner.  Not since Patricia Cornwell's 'Kay Scarpeta' series have I been so entertained. After finishing this, the first in the series of 'Micky Knight' mysteries, I immediately had to order the following three 
 This album makes it to the top of my ambient music collection. It even replaces Ishq "Orchid" which held the #1 position since August 2004. If you are looking for an instrumental ambient CD that you can relax to or take a mental journey with, this is the one. I sometimes put the headphones on at work to block out the co-workers and listen or pop it in the CD player on the way home to unwind. My favorite tracks are 14:31, 9:39, and 12:18. The liner notes reveal that the band didn't want to bias your listening experience by naming the tracks. Definitely a sentiment I agree with 
 _Sex and Rockets:  The Occult World of Jack Parsons_ published by Feral House Press written by an individual writing under the name of John Carter is a fascinating account of the life of John Whiteside Parsons a.k.a. Jack Parsons a.k.a. Marvel Parsons, rocket scientist and occultist.  Jack Parsons was a rocket scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech whose work on rockets along with that of Theodore von Karman and Ed Forman paved the way for the development of the space program.  But, Parsons also had a darker aspect to him, he dabbled in the occult and was a disciple of black magician Aleister Crowley.  This book discusses both aspects of Parsons' personality, mentioning both his business ventures and his occult dabblings in which he may have attempted to create a "moonchild" (a sort of humonculous from the writings of Crowley).  In addition, Parsons was friends for a time with the creator of scientology and science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard.  Hubbard himself, contrary to scientology propaganda, also dabbled in the occult, but indeed was a confidence man and ended up taking Parsons' wife and his money.  This book discusses both rockets and the occult aspects of Crowleyian magic.  In particular, the Enochian alphabet of John Dee is mentioned, by which Dee an Elizabethan magus, believed he could communicate privately with those who knew the secrets of this dark language.  Parsons, although a strident individualist, had many friends who supported communism, and it may have been as a result of these friendships in addition to his sexual proclivities and the occult goings-on at his home that led to the loss of his security clearance.  Parsons also may have become involved with Israel and attempted to sell secrets to the Israelis.  Parsons died in a freak accident, in which his basement exploded after he supposedly carelessly stored highly explosive chemicals.  However, many have suggested that this explosion was not an accident and that in fact he was murdered, either for his dealings with corrupt cops who blackmailed him or for his involvement with Israeli intelligence.  Indeed, Parsons had served as an expert witness in a case involving explosives and had had to testify against corrupt police officers.  When his mother heard the news of her son's death, she committed suicide as well, making the end of this story doubly tragic.  However, Parsons was honored by JPL and the space program when a crater on the dark side of the moon was named after him.  This book tells a fascinating story of a rather bizarre individual whose expertise in the construction of rockets and whose occult dabblings make him a modern day Renaissance figure.  It will be of interest to those interested in magic and the occult, as well as those who are interested in the history of modern rocketry in America 
 My preschool special ed students LOVE this book, they would read it 10 times each day if I allowed them to.  It's fun, had wonderful pop-ups and pull tabs and reinforces beginning reading skills such as rhyming.  A must for children who need encouragement to listen to stories 
 Dan Patrick exemplifies outstanding sports reporting.  In Outtakes, he engages his dry sense of humor and mixes it together with his extraordinary knowledge of the sports world.  Outtakes is a candid collection of  interviews with sports' celebrities of past and present.  He is not afraid  to ask the questions that everyone truly wants to ask, and the word  associations are outright hysterical.  Patrick is one of the wittiest  people on the face of the earth.  Outtakes just shines with this.  The book  is an easy read, and has a good, steady flow to it.  It is one entertaining  ride into the insightful mind of Dan Patrick, sports' guru.  Just hold on,  because the laughs come hard and fast 
 This and the author's other volume are true works of art.  I can't wait for the next volume, which will hopefully bring some levity to issues like arthritis, Alzheimers, hardening of the arteries, varicose veins and other atrocities of old age 
 I saw Journey 2 Times in the Steve Perry period. I SAW the FRONTIERS  L.A.show, then the Raised On Radio show in Long Beach. They were both great shows, but the change in the band on the Raised On Radio album gave the band a stronger, punchier sound. And the live show was the Proof,I told a friend today that "Raised On Radio is like the perfect album" I still love this album, and the reissue CD has that reminder of the power of that live show. The 2 live tracks at the end are Fantastic, I Want More! Journey Fans, Buy this CD, You'll Love it... I Still Do 
 As something of a Zorro/Guy Williams expert myself I didn't know what to expect from Antoinette Lane's book. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised; everytime I turned a page I found out something else I didn't know about the elusive Guy Williams. The research for this book is exhaustive and if you have never written a book then you have no idea how difficult it is to find  good solid information  on a relativly obscure 1950's tv actor much less find their motivations for things they've done in their life. I also found Lane to be a good writer and not just a "secretary";she involves the reader in the life of Guy Williams and that's what a good biographer does. Guy Williams was not perfect,Lord knows none of us are but he led an interesting and entertaining life and Lane's biography opens up a window and lets us take a peek. Some fans may not like what they see,that's not the authors fault. Some people simply need to grow up. I for one like Guy Williams even more now than I did before. Thank you Ms.Lane for an excellent book. Gerry Dooley Author of The Zorro Television Companio 
 This book reads like a novel, only better. Very fast paced and always holds your interest, if you find the "70's pot smuggling scene" interesting. These characters seem like pirates, like a fantasy. Very easy to read. I liked it 
 Rob Zombie's The Sinister Urge is another great metal pumping record given to us by the man himself.  Containing many great songs, some that sound more like White Zombie than those found on Hellbilly Deluxe; such as Demon Speeding.  Others include the excellent Iron Head Featuring Ozzy Osbourne.  The title is a cross between Ozzy's Iron mans and Rob's Electric Head songs, in case you didn't know that.  And my favorite track House of 1000 Corpses is absolutely perfect with its bizarre news report intro.  It really sets the atmosphere for the song.  I feel that Rob shouldn't have made the terrible movie that is House of 1000 Corpses and instead should have just worked on the soundtrack for the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which the film blatantly rips off).     But not all is perfect on this trip into the mind of Rob Zombie.  The song Dead Girl Superstar with Kerry King (of Slayer) really is nothing special.  I didn't even know Kerry was in it until I glanced at the credits.  It is also the only song with swear in it too.  The terrible/boring music video for it doesn't help either. The CD sleeved is filled with dull nudity and those two reasons are the only ones as to why there is a Parental Advisory slapped on the front.  The filler/interlude Transylvanian Transmission Pt. 1 is basically like Perversion 99 or any of the other filler tracks on Hellbilly deluxe.  Also I couldn't care less for the songs Bring Her Down or Go to California.  The hidden track unholy 3 just sounds like a bad B-Side, but is fun to listen to nether the less.  All the other songs that I haven't mentioned are great.    When I got this, I got a limited version that came with a bonus disc titled Calling all Maniacs that was basically a compilation of several bands with new records coming out. (Mainly Debuts) A handful of them have become some of my favorite bands and as a result I hold a lot of respect for this record.  Without it, I would have never found out about bands like Dry Kill Logic and it also convinced me to go buy a Slayer CD.   Both of those bands are killer.  Other bands found on the disc that took my interest, but only later found to be disappointments were, Dope, Otep and Mushroomhead.  Many more are included.    Technically I feel that Hellbilly Deluxe is the better of the two solo efforts by Rob Zombie, but this is still an "explosive" CD to drive to.  Well done.  I hoped this helped, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.   
 Disney travels to the Grecian island of Crete to film this enjoyable tale of a young English girl, played by teen favorite Hayley Mills and her Aunt (Joan Greenwood), who are traveling the area in search of native folk songs.  While visiting Crete, Hayley meets young and handsome Peter McEnery, and is soon swept up into mystery, romance, and intrigue.  The film has a Hitchcock feel to it, and reminds the viewer a little of "To Catch A Thief" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much."  I believe it's the locales and the fine performance of Eli Wallach, as the jewel thief Strattos.  I highly recommend "The Moon-Spinners," it has a vacation feel and is quite enjoyable to watch, especially for Hayley Mills fans.  The dvd is featured in the full screen format, however, the picture's transfer is very clean and the audio sounds good.  I too, would prefer the films in their original wide screen formats, but just to have these Disney classic films available to add to my dvd library, whether full screen or wide screen, is something to be thankful for.  
 If you love the subject of pen & ink, you'll no doubt love this book.  It contains one of the most thorough collection of basic pen strokes, and an impressive variety of styles: from simple portraits to highly elaborate fantasy art.  One of my favorite parts is showing how a drawing shall look incorporating a variety of different pen strokes with each of 24 renderings.  This chapter concludes with a reproducable sketch that can be used by the student to explore the exercises.  A book replete with examples and exercises.  Highly recommended 
 If you have an S - Video port on your laptop and you want to display this on a TV it works, without those expensive converters.  
 Although Black Wind is not the best Clive Cussler book in the legendary Dirk Pitt series, it continues with the high level of rip roaring adventures under, above and on the sea that we have come to expect and love.  The Dirk Pitt Jr and original Pitt in the same story does take some getting used to even if you've read Trojan Odyssey but DP Jr, like Dirk Cussler, is working out to be a worthy successor.  The series is in good hands.  The Cusslers' knowledge of wreck hunting and all things maritime makes for some enthralling reading.  A good book for the keen Dirk Pitt/Cussler fan and a great one for someone new to these adventures 
 This book offered a wonderful protrail of the classic by alfred noyes. The pictures within 'the highwayman' are great, they have been wonderfuly drawn by Charles Keeping to portray the fantasic poem that has won the hearts of so many 
 This books leaves me with mixed emotions. On the positive side, it's the only book I know of its kind, covering almost every topic of modern philosophy. And, for the most part, it is highly accessible and remarkably clear (philosophy of language can be opaque, but that's inherent in the field). On the con side, not enough attention is paid to ethics and politics (Scruton himself is somewhat of a conservative/communitarian), and the topic of aesthetics could have been more informative. Another con is that Scruton tells the reader in advance that his own opinion will seep into the discussion, but that he'll designate it as such. Well, yes, his opinion does creep in, but it's rarely distinguished as his own. Yet, for all these quibbles, I cannot imagine a better introduction to the discipline of philosophy as it is practiced in Anglo-American circles - but without the arcane and often obtuse language. It is remarkably broad in scope, accurate in depiction, clearly mapped, and fairly thorough for an overview. If one wants an introduction into how Angophone philosophy is practiced, I cannot recommend a better book 
 Frankly speaking, this book is easy to understand for a foreigner like me.  Banks uses simple words and fluent writing style to sketch the outline of multicultural education.  Althought I think it simplifies the content of multicultural education, it's still a good textbook for a person who begins to enter the world of multicultural education

 Sea Level is truly one of the best rock,jaz,blues combo bands to ever come out of the south eastern U.S.  The combination of great vocals and outstanding instrumentals make this a prize recording for any musical taste.  The colaboration of Randall Bramblett and Chuck Leavell with their musical superiority and inventive styles  are simply terrific.    The pure instumentals on this CD rival anything out of rock and roll today.  The problem for Sea Level was that they were years ahead of thier time, today no band could hold a candle to thier music! This CD should be a classic and a must for anyone 
 I gained a whole new insight on how the devil infiltrates the lives of my children.Like so many other mothers who have committed themselves to take a stand against the enemy for their children this book gave me more kwoledge on how to do so. Praise Jesus for the Hammonds 
 This book is good, as always when it comes to Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler.) However, it was as not as good as I thought ti would be. I would have to say, this book is my least favorite in a Series of Unfortunate Events, but it is still very good.   If you want ot buy this book, but have not read the other books before this, read the other books before you read this, or you will have no idea whatsoever what is going on.   Lemony Snicket, or Daniel Handler, is a great writer, in my opinion, but only devoted Snicket fans will actually appreciate his talents.   But of course, there are devoted Snicket fans all over the library. 
 This was a great movie. Kept me in suspense. Buy it. 
 Now here's a book that really got me thinking about what went on during the Second World War. It's a shame that something so monumentous is becoming nearly forgotten after only sixty years have passed. There are a lot of parallels to the current situation of the world between the free world and terrorism. We aren't nearly as determined as our grandfathers were to win a war. It's a shame. 
 This is a really cute book! I teach first grade. My students loved finding the rhyming words at the end of every other line. They also enjoyed the pictures and overall story. It is one of my favorite Valentine's books and is appropriate for young and old student 
 I'm not a big reader of novels, but I picked this one up at the store because it sounded like it could be interesting. I was correct...I found the subject(s) intriguing. Whereas I usually like to identify a little with the main character, I did not with this one...in fact, did not really like her (though there's nothing wrong with that). I did like, however, the author's writing style and a fair amount of what she had to say apart from the storyline. I found myself occasionally writing down quotes from the book as I was reading it. This is not something I do unless what the author is saying has struck a chord with me. Overall, for me, it was a good read and I'll be more likely to read another of this author's novels now 
 This book was a great help to prepare my 4 year old daughter for surgery. Once she was at the hospital, everything was known and already seen in the book and she had fun.. I highly recommend it to relieve the anxiety before a surger 
 This is a perfect gift--but first give it to yourself. Bascove takes the same care selecting and arranging prose and poetry as she does composing her lush oils, which tell their own stories. I savored the book cover-to-cover, at one point stumbling up the subway steps because I had my nose buried in it. This is a singularly beautiful book in every way 
 My husband and I completed these workbooks (he filled out the "for men" and I did the "for women" obviously).  These excercises were really good for understanding differences based on upbringing.  We have preconceptions of how marriage is supposed to be -- and these preconceptions are based on our experience with our parents' marriages.  Your spouse/fiance may have different preconceptions, and if these differences aren't discussed, there is potential for resentment to develop.  Knowing is half the battle -- these workbooks opened up discussion for us (not to mention that they saved us quite a few arguments) and we would wholeheatedly recommend them 
 I have 3 pairs of Sightsees and want more!  I have a narrow foot and need arch support to the extent of wearing orthotics in some of my shoes.  These shoes are NOT narrow (yet not wide), but because of the Velcro strap and arch support, I am able to wear these.  And, I don't need the orthotics!    They are extrememly cool and comfortable... suitable for being on your feet all day.  Because of their slight Euro look, they go with almost anything.  In other words, you can wear them with dresses or with gauchos or to the gym.  I've found them in bronze and silver, and lots of other great colors.  They aren't cheap, but a great shoe at that.  These are probably my absolute favorite shoes.  I live in mine and would wear them more often if I had more colors! :)  By the way, I'm in my late 40s and a grandma--though I don't look like it.  I get tons of compliments on these shoes from college students and other moms and grandmas!    
 How do we get the significant information from such a well-researched book through the ears and eyes and into the minds of some of our legislators and government leaders? All of us need to be informed but infortunately, simply gaining such information is not an end in itself. If anyone out there reads this book and is able to actuate those people who are the decision-makers for our country, PLEASE go for it 
 This remaster of a blues rock classic rates 5 stars for content and 4 for the sound.  The remaster of Irish Tour is better in that it succeeds in taking the sound of that old twofer live set to the level of actually being there.  Tattoo was a great record and this cd just takes the scratches and pops out.  I guess that should be enough but after listening to the remastered Irish Tour, I was expecting more.  Buy it anyway cuz there aint nobody makin' reckids like this anymore 
 Dr. Rogers' book enabled me to cure my reflux and improved my quality of life tremendously.  I'd suffered from daily reflux for many years. Doctors had prescribed different medicines, and done endoscopies, but nothing helped sufficiently. In desperation, I searched for a good book and found "NO More Heartburn." I started using her DGL protocol and cut out some junk, and as a result my reflux improved 90%. Then, thanks to the confidence these results gave me in integrative, high tech medicine as practiced by Dr. Rogers, I found an experienced local integrative physician, Dr. Len Saputo, who ran some of the tests recommended in the book. As a result, I've been taking supplements to correct nutritional deficiencies, now avoid foods I am sensitive to, am chelating the many heavy metals in my system, etc. This has cured by reflux (I rarely get it now), and improved my other health problems tremendously.  For over ten years I've suffered from several medical conditions that doctors' could not improve, but just cover up with drugs. Thanks to Dr. Rogers and Dr. Saputo, my quality of life has tripled!  Now I recommend Dr. Rogers' and Dr. Saputo's books to people I care about. Your health is worth the few bucks the book costs. Give it a try 
 Whether you play golf or not, this is a great read. Story line moves fast and characters are engaging.   If you do play golf, well... let's just say you are in for a real treat. This book is so well written that you can almost smell the fresh cut grass of putting greens.   Scratch and Foursome from the same author are also great read.   
 More than 100 poems being written today, Native American poetry is the poetry of historic witness. It comes out the past, which is the present. This book tells stories about people, animals and how they live. These poems are mostly about Navajos in different states like Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico 	 	If you're a person that loves to read poetry than this is a book that will sweep you off your feet and into another world. The poems I liked the best was "If I love you", and "Bear: a totem dance as seen by raven." "If I love you" is about a person trying to tell someone if they really care and what they see inside. "Bear: A totem dance as seen by raven" is about a bear who dances like a man but slowly and in the night he could hear the raven cry. The bear dances with elders and children's. They were both awesome. It felt like I was in the poem when I was reading it.  
 I purchased a Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the Cascades in Oregon. I have owned a liquid fuel stove for years (MSR Whisperlite purchased in approx 1992), and have loved it, but as I am getting older, I have been wanting to trim my pack weight down. I have found the following advantages to the F1 Ultralight. #1. Easy to use. Simply unscrew the burner head, open the pan supports, screw the burner head back down, screw stove onto canister, light match, twist valve, and you are cooking with gas. #2. No priming. The liquid fuel stoves required priming, and pumping, which made them harder to use than I would have expected. With this stove, you simply turn the valve and light. No waiting for the generator to heat up. #3. Very light weight. The stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone. This thing is a feather on the back. The disadvantages are there as well. #1. Canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister, and at temps close to, or below the boiling point, which is close to 0 fahrenheit, the stove simply will not work. For me, where and when I camp, this is not an issue. #2. Fuel cannot be used as an emergency fire starter.  #3. Fuel is EXPENSIVE compared to white gas, or unleaded gasoline.  The owners manual claims this stove only works with Coleman Brand canisters, but I have found that any threaded canister of 70/30 Butane / Propane blend works. I have used Brunton, Coleman, MSR, and some odd black Canister I bought at a gas station in Oregon with it, all with excellent results.. Compared with other canister stoves such as the MSR Pocket Rocket, Brunton Optimus Crux, Snow Peak Giga Power Stove, or Primus Yellowstone Techno Trail, the Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me, sported the lowest weight (.4oz lower than its nearest competitor), and from what I was able to determine in impromptu in store testing, appeared to have the best pot stability of the group, with pot supports that spread out nice and wide. One tidbit about this however is... The Evernew 1.3L Titanium cookpot, is oddly shaped on the bottom, and sits and a slightly odd angle on the F1. I have tried many other pots and this is the only one I have a problem with. The issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the Evernew pot, and NOT with the Coleman stove... SUMMARY. If you camp where the temps aren't freezing, low weight, ease of use are important, and cost of fuel is unimportant, then this is the stove for you. However you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood. If however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you, or you are going to go mountain climbing, or whatever, you will want to bypass any canister stove at all, and just go with a gasoline model instead. The Coleman F1 Ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves I had considered, had the best design, and came in at a price point that I liked. For the majority of backpackers out there, I would say this would be the best stove for you. 
 An excellent source of information for anyone interested in grazing dairy cows. Best suited for the beginner but valuable observations that everyone grazing cows can benefit from 
 The cast & orchestrations are incredible for the Tony-winning 2003 revival of "Nine", surpassing even the original 1982 production.  Best tracks include:  My Husband Makes Movies A Call From The Vatican    [Jane Krakowski's Tony-winning number] Only With You    [Antonio Banderas' version outshines Raul Julia's original] Folies Bergeres    [Chita Rivera's big song] The Bells Of St. Sebastian    [though the original is somewhat better] Unusual Way    [Banderas/Benanti's beautiful duet & best song of the show] Simple Be On Your Own    [Mary Stuart Masterson's gut-wrenching song]  A truly beautiful score 
 I was a bit skeptical upon first seeing this book. I worried about another floofy book about New Age/Western Buddhism. Thankfully, my fears were unfounded. This book is a fairly dense "argument" between the present positions of astrophysics/quantum physics and the Buddhist metaphysics. I'm a philosopher by trade and I read a lot of popular science books (especially in physics) so I managed well with the text. However, I think it may frustrate some persons without any background. So, ultimately, unless you are somewhat familiar with contemporary physics, you might want, regrettably, to skip this one.   The Buddhist in the book is a very intelligent chap, more than capable of explaining/defending his position.  And he successfully presents Buddhism in a very intellectual manner. I learned a lot about the Buddhist position with regard to cosmology - which is wonderful because that's what I hoped to get out of the book. I think this book should quiet some of the stereotypes of Buddhists... and it would be most enjoyed by persons who do not draw a hard absolute line between natural science and religious practice 
 Well I didn't even know what a duvet was until about a week before I purchased this.  So I'm obviously no expert on them.  It was nice and thick, almost thick enough to be a blanket by itself. I like the color and it fit my comforter just fine.   The only issue I've had with it is that it leaves some green fuzz on the bed but I'm sure that is just because I haven't washed it yet.  Its not even much and only really shows up because I have it on white sheets, and I'm sure its my own fault for not prewashing it. It does its job and I'm satisfied with it 
 It is amazing how many people I have met who cite John Robbins' previous classic book "Diet for a New America" as the book which has had the biggest influence on their life.  This book is basically a rewritten, enlarged and updated version of "Diet for a New America".  It explains the extreme benefits of adopting a whole foods plant based diet.  He presents the scientific evidence supporting the multiple health benefits for eating this way, as well as the strong ethical reasons.  It is above all a fascinating read, written by the person who was the heir to Baskin-Robbins, the world's largest ice cream company (he rejected it to live according to his own values).  One also gets a deep sense of the immense compassion of the man through his writing.  John Robbins is someone I would certainly want at the table of my fantasy dinner party!  It would make for a lively and interesting conversation and hopefully the chef would be persuaded to prepare some wonderful healthy vegan food.  By the way, he never mentions the word "vegan" but that is what you will probably want to be if you read this book! 
 "Big Brother is watching!" This phrase has been so popularly used that the meaning is now synonymous with issues like "manipulation of truth", "violation of privacy", "conspiracy theory", etc. `1984' is a cleverly written political satire often induced with dark humour, exploring life in a would-be fascist-like totalitarian future where everyone was being monitored and compelled to keep in line ('thoughtcrime' is a crime!), where the individual could no longer differentiate between truths and lies (through the practice of `doublethink'), where history was being constantly re-written to suit the prevailing political agenda, where language had been simplified to the point of uselessness (through Newspeak), where war had to be kept ongoing to reduce economic surplus so that the population could be held under control, and where party ideology had absolute power over a society dominated by fear, suspicion and distrust.   We follow the story of Winston Smith, one who disagreed with the party and was secretly envisioning a different kind of life without being under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother. His hatred for Big Brother and his attempt at joining the rebelling Brotherhood ultimately ended in tragedy and he was captured, tortured and brainwashed. Orwell's gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing. The last section of the book is especially thought provoking and really sends chill to the spine. Overall, Orwell's vision of the future in 1984 is intense and highly disturbing. Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell's `1984' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism. This book is highly recommended 
 This is one of the best books I've read about the business of voiceovers, and I've read them all. Hearing "how they did it" from some of the best performers in the country makes for a fascinating read, but there's plenty of real world information from the artists as well, including marketing tips, studio conduct, union membership and the "art of the craft."   I appreciate that the proceeds of this book are being donated to the Alzheimer's Association. As a voiceover performer myself, I'm acutely aware that the word "voice" means much more than simply an instrument for talking. The voice is the means by which we convey our soul; it is the stream of our identity. Successful voiceover performers, such as those featured in this book, are able to convey emotion and heart through their work, and the listener has a sense of who they are from the way they shape the words. All of us who make a living in this business have contemplated losing our voices, but for an Alzheimer's patient, the loss of voice is much more profound than losing the ability to communicate; it is the loss of identity. Using a book focused on voiceovers as a means to fight a disease that robs its victims of their voices is inspiring, and very creative.    For voice performers, this book is a wonderful addition to your personal library. If you already make a living using your voice, or hope to, purchasing this book is an investment--you're "paying it forward" as you learn from the best in the business. 
 Farmer and Poet Scott Chaskey gives us this wonderful work following his journey on his South Fork farm for a year. Follow Chaskey through the spring, summer, autumn, and Winter as he learns and explores life on this organic farm.  This book appeals to the senses and to the heart.  *** 
 "Dark Tort" is the latest addition in *the* leading culinary mystery series being published today.  The plots are well thought out, the cooking sequences are delightful, and the recipes make for an enjoyable weekend afternoon in the kitchen.  Also, as a native "Coloradoan", hunting for the real-life basis for the various locales Goldy describes adds a nice "side-mystery" to enjoy!  I highly recommend this and the other Goldy Bear culinary mystery books. 
 I frequently use Juran and Gryna's Quality Control Handbook as a reference for my work and writing. It is a comprehensive reference for many issues in quality management, quality control,  and statisitical process control.  There are excellent discussions of quality as "fitness for  use," and the true costs of poor quality.  If you plan to take any of the American Society for Quality  Control's certification examinations, this is a good reference.  I used it for the Quality Engineering, Reliability Engineering,  Quality Management, and Quality Auditing exams, and it served  me well in each case.       -William A. Levinso 
 I love this popcorn... but can't find it locally. Thank goodness I found it online so I can still get it 
 This is certainly one of Woodward's better efforts. I didnt find a "cheerleader" mentality for the administration as has been asserted by some.  I did find it extremely interesting on how Woodward was able to clearly delineate the differences within the administration on whether to go to war or not. Would have liked to have seen more on Rumsfeld, who I believe escapes closer scrutiny in this book, as to his exact role in the decision for war. I also think General Franks gets off pretty lightly on the failure of the administration to adequately prepare for the "end of hostilities" and what the exact plan for the occupation would be--per Colin Powell's State Dept's concern. Very quick read, and excellent insight (as usual) by Woodward into the inner sanctum of decision-making in the highest levels of government 
 For any salesperson or any person. since we do not sell only services we also sell ourselves be it in a job in a relationship. It is definately a must read 
 I have had digital cameras for about 5 years and still own an Olympus 5 megapixel, and a Casio 7 megapixel. Seems like Megamixels alone just don't cut it for me. I read about the rebel XT in a magazine and looked up the user reviews here on Amazon. I decided to go and buy one and though I am really a novice, I am extremely impressed. I have never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors from a Point & Shoot. I started with the basic settings and love the results.I am slowly progressing to more advanced settings and am getting better everyday. Even a novice who just wants stunning photography will be amazed with this camera. I also bought a Tamron 75-300 Autofocus zoom lens (look for it here on Amazon.com) and after lots of practice, have been able to take some great pictures. I have a brother in the UK who is also into digital photography, and after seeing some (full reso) photos I sent him, he rushed out and bought the XTi (called the EOS 400D across the pond)and is amazed with it.  I still have a lot to learn but really cannot fault this camera. The included software is also excellent.  For the record, some reviews seem to think it is too small to hold, I have big hands and don't have any problems at all. I admit though this is the first SLR I have ever owned. I will still keep a point and shoot to keep in my travel bag for spontaneous photography but I am in love with my Rebel XT!!  This camera costs quite chunk of change but I think it is well worth it and I do recommend it to everyone 
 Robert Parker has a certain love for ironic plots.  Bad Business, with its cluster of detectives following various spouses to determine who is cheating whom, is full of irony and misdirection.  Spenser is hired by the wife of one executive to follow her husbands who seems to have hired another detective to...  Well, you get the idea - open marriages gone psychotic.  Or so it would seem.  But when murder begins to become a part of the shenanigans Spenser realizes that something more important is at stake in a story that picks up on the Enron scandals and then stands loyalty and faithfulness on its head.  Kinergy has its own variations on corporate corruption, and layered on top of this is a talk show host who wants to maximize bed sharing.  Of course, Susan Silverman, Pearl the Wonder Dog II, and Hawk put in regular appearances so that us Spenser junkies will get our filp of flip and sarcastic dialog.  After all, it is Parker's wizardry with dialog that keeps us coming back.  Even if the story is a bit frail, the players make up for it time and again.  Spenser is the last true knight of Boston.  He still compulsively comes to the rescue and can't stand to see a woman cry.  The times change in these novels, but the main characters remain stable and attractive as if they lived in a time line all there own.  And frankly, I can never resist them.  My one complaint with any Spenser novel is that it is too short.  Parker's writing ability draws the reader through the book at lightning speed, and it's all too easy to finish them in one or two sittings.  On the other hand, they never cloy, and are often just the right length to refresh one after reading too many serious stories 
 I was first turned on to this album around '83 - '84. I have a brother ten years older than me and he had Sad Wings on vinyl. When I first started getting into metal/hard rock it was Iron Maiden, Saxon, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Rush, 80's Priest. I was listening to Maiden/Killers one day in my room when he burst in, took the record off and started to put Sad Wings on. I was pissed at first and jumped up to stop him. He pushed me back down and said, "just listen". So I did. I must have listened to Sad Wings 20 to 30 times in a row that evening. I turned all my long haired, metal head buddies on to it the next day. It is probably, if not the best, then one of the best metal albums ever 
 If you want perfection , don't buy this one.  If this is your first Goldberg, don't buy this one.  If you want passion in the performance of this beautiful music, buy this one.  
 ...once you tear out the subscription cards, there are no ads (unless you count one unobtrusive one buried in the publisher's information, telling you how to renew your subscription or order a slipcase).  Each issue includes a tear-out activity...a craft or game related to that issue's theme.  The cast of characters is fairly diverse with various races represented.  And if you like your child's reading material to be secular, this magazine fits the bill.    My 4 year old and I look forward to each issue...it's a little expensive for 9 issues, but it's worth it 
 When reading this book, it's quite easy to picture yourself a Hollywood movie, which fits the Rockefeller Center for the project is indeed a movie star in the New York City skyline. Okrent gives a dramatic and richly written insight in the way the Rockefeller Center came in to being, but to me he focuses a tad too much on the characters involved. Not the project itself is being treated like a movie star, but especially the great number of people involved, even if only indirectly. If you wouldn't know any better, you'd think Okrent must have been close personal friends to all characters. This is how one of the many characters is being introduced: "But of all people...no one was more important...then a slight, sandy haired former financial clerk from Westfield, New Jersey, who loved to dress in light blue, wore a thin, exquisitely trimmed moustache, lived in an apartment on Riverside Drive with his mother and sister, and was rarely happier than when he could stand in the wings of the Music Hall's vast stage and shout 'Shake it up for daddy, girls'".  The story is a good All American read, but if you are looking for more insight into the development and construction process and less drama, you'd probably prefer Karl Sabbagh's 'Skyscraper: The Making of a Building' or Jerry Adler's 'High-Rise: ...' 
 For us this is a LIFE SAVER!!... It has been really helpfull... I even bought another one for my mother's house... Im agree with a lot of nice stuff from other reviews and Im not going to repeat them, but I have to say something about how many times it gets full.  It's not true that it gets full everyday.... or.... It would get full if you put the diapers open.... What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use, and you would see the difference... I use to change it every 2 days, now It gets full every 4 days.... The refills are not expensive at all, and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us, buying 2 or 3 together....I use one refill every 3 weeks or so....I haven't try any other one in the market, but for me this is perfect, so I could say that is the BEST OPTION!! 
 This book is called,After The Dancing DAYS.This is one of my favator booksI have ever read.There is a girl and boy that go to a dance and they date.i like this book because it is aboutlove and the author caught my attention by useing beatful words.You should read it some time.It is a very good book. 
 Of the many  illuminating insights into Franklin provided by Gordon Wood, possibly the most useful to people entrusted today with great affairs is the signal  point when Franklin is  transformed  from English loyalist to American patriot.  It is a parable on the dangers of illusion to its creators.   Wood makes clear that Franklin always wanted to be an English gentleman serving   King and Empire. Franklin cherished the thought that he was accepted as one in London as much as in Philadelphia.  And he was ecstatic when powerful lords gave him  the idea  that he might be appointed undersecretary for American affairs.   It is conceivable that had this happened Franklin,  elevated to this great station,  might have negotiated an evolution of affairs that would have made the Atlantic truly a pond within the English Empire.    Of course, it didn't happen.   Franklin was not appointed; his ambitious hopes, crushed.  Furthermore, he was humiliated by the very members of that Great Club he so wanted to join. He had allowed himself to be fooled by an illusion.   But spinning  illusions can be a dangerous pastime. Instead of bowing in abject humility to the lords, Franklin is said to have whispered into the ear of his principal antagonist: "I will make your master a little king for this."  And so he did. 
 I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was "WE SELL THE EARTH." C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community 
 YES, ALL SHOULD KNOW HOW THE NORTH(BIG BUSINESS)COMPLICITY WITH SLAVERY.  ALSO,  THAT THE NORTH(NEW YORK AND THE OTHER 12 ORIGINAL COLONIES )HAD SLAVES, AND THE RELUCTANCE WHEN THE CIVIL WAR STARTED 
 As a big fan of Roeg, Bowie, and sci-fi in general, I was intrigued enough to purchase the new Criterion edition as a blind buy (also aided in my decision by some positive reviews from friends whose opinion I trust). Overall, I think it was a great decision, if a bit pricey.  David Bowie stars Thomas Jerome Newton, who we first see stumbling around disoriented on earth. He is a technical genius and privately arranges to meet with one Oliver Farnsworth - with a scientific breakthrough and a lofty business plan in mind. Farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager and begins amassing wealth for Thomas, who wants to become rich for reasons known only to him. Another scientist, Nathan Bryce, is also commissioned to be part of the research and development - this time for a space project. Around the same time Thomas meets a young and naive girl, Mary Lou, who helps save his life and cares for him (and eventually becomes his lover, despite Thomas having a wife). While all of this is going on, a rival corporation has noticed Newton's success and is keen to bring his empire of technology down. Of course, in a film like this, none of that matters at all.  That's because Thomas is [i]presumably[/i] an alien who has come to earth in order to save his small desert planet and his family, who appear to be the only survivors after two successive nuclear wars have wrecked havoc on the planet's atmosphere. I say "presumably" because, despite obvious (the scene with his eyes, I will say no more) and subtle (his constant need of water, his reactions to moving at a fast speed) visual and performance/dialogue clues, the film ends rather ambiguously on this crucial point. In my mind, the possible layer of Newton not being an alien at all is rather fascinating. However, if taken on the surface only, Nicolas Roeg has concocted a visually and sonically impressive sci-fi classic, with a fine and appropriate misanthropic and moody performance by David Bowie.  Roeg takes his time to develop the story around the loose framework of the novel but uses a number of interesting visuals and abstract imagery/metaphor in order to convey his major themes - the loneliness and the vices of man, the ruthlessness of the corporate and commercial world, the way we would potentially react to such a visitor (with malice). The other major theme, of course, is sexuality and the power of sex to destroy; Bryce is considered a problem because of his taste for very young women, and Newton's fateful encounter with Mary Lou, however in control he may appear to be at first, ends up doing the same as she introduces him to the joys and follies of human sexuality and also alcohol (which screws with his system and causes hallucinations - much like real life for us humans, eh?).  The film is not without flaws. There are a number of bizarre dialogue exchanges, especially between Newton and Mary Lou, that do nothing to enhance the plot or the development of either character. One particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene, using a gun and a lot of firing blanks as a sexual allegory, goes on forever and is utterly pointless and without context in that stage of the film. Strange and disturbing visual cues abound and some are particularly effective, but the frequent use of naked bodies writhing around in some kind of oatmeal throughout the film is silly. And not nearly enough time is spent on the reasons and motivations of how exactly Newton intends to save his planet.  Still, a straightforward linear film would have been far less compelling and is not what Roeg intended to make anyway. It is said by the writer in an accompanying interview that Roeg let the spirit of the book guide his choices, and to a large extent that is true; he does remain faithful to the [i]spirit[/i] of the narrative and does not deviate from the central plot. And his distinct visual sense is astonishing to behold for those unfamiliar with his work. However, the grade of the film dips slightly because of the flaws outlined above with regard to pacing, structure, and story. Despite all that, I'm glad I bought it and will look forward to seeing it again with the commentary in order to absorb all the details I missed the first time. An excellent but difficult and challenging piece of science fiction from a visionary director - It's amazing to think that "Star Wars" was only a year away....  
 Childstar is a funny (yet at the same time funny) movie. It has good acting, and an original story. Childstar is a little indie film that's quaint and witty 
 "Pierre" is perhaps Melville's most difficult and challenging novel--and that's saying something. Despairing over his inability to support his family, Melville began writing a book designed to be popular--a counterpoint to the sensational novels written and read by contemporary women, using inspiration from French romances and even from Hawthorne's novels. Wavering between psychological melodrama and social satire, Melville ultimately increased the book's length by half again, incorporating his rage against the literary world by adding a subplot about a young man's desperate struggle to become a writer.  The stumbling point for most readers is the novel's opaque prose, the "thees and thous" of its antiquated dialogue, and the labyrinthine hodgepodge of a plot. But the density is broken by colloquial asides, sparkling sarcasm, and an occasional passage that approaches Dickensian mirth, such as Melville's description of the "Preposterous Mrs. Tartan!" and her undercover attempts to play matchmaker between Pierre and her daughter: "Once, and only once, had a dim suspicion passed through Pierre's mind, that Mrs. Tartan was a lady thimble-rigger, and slyly rolled the pea."  Behind the mask of the prose, however, is a modernist--even scandalous--story of a young, somewhat deluded man whose nihilistic descent leads to his destruction. Engaged to Lucy Tartan, Pierre adores his mother (their make-believe brother-sister relationship is almost creepy in its amorous undertones) and worships the memory of his long-dead father. This idyllic world is shattered by a missive from a woman, Isabel, who claims to be his half-sister--a claim supported by a more-than-passing resemblance to a portrait of his father. Complicating matters are his romantic feelings for this alleged half-sister.   Convincing himself that he is choosing honor over duty, he breaks off his engagement and flees to Manhattan with Isabel, taking along a local woman who had been disgraced by an out-of-wedlock tryst. Disowned by his mother and cut off from his family fortune, Pierre finds shelter for this odd trio among bohemian neighbors in a dilapidated part of town. His finances slowly evaporating, Pierre struggles to support them by writing a novel. And then, just when the plot can barely handle another twist, his estranged fiancee Lucy shows up at their doorstep.  To go any further would spoil the fun for the reader. Yet even such a basic plot summary omits some memorable and extraordinary scenes and sketches: his first meeting with Isabel, the near-riot that greets them during their first night in Manhattan, the eccentric philosopher who refuses to put his scholarly brilliance into written form.  Adultery, incest, madness, murder, and suicide--all the ingredients of a bleak nineteenth-century melodrama are wrapped in archaic language and modern themes. In her life of Melville, Robertson-Lorant calls "Pierre" "a narrative nervous breakdown" that is a "minefield" for biographers. It's also a goldmine; in no other work does Melville more clearly ridicule his critics, his friends and family, and even himself. The weird universe of "Pierre" is not the place to start if you've never read Melville, but it's certainly where you should go if you want better to understand his life and works 
 Paul Pillar brings stunning clarity and an insider's sagacity to a subject that is far more complex than the sound-bites and political posturing that we normally hear.  Written before Sept. 11th, it is amazingly accurate in its assessment of the pitfalls and possibilities of counter-terrorist policy decisions.  This is essential reading for a congress that has far too often passed simplistic and consequently counter-productive legislation to cure a problem that they don't fully comprehend.  Though written by a savvy professional in this field, the book is amazingly lucid and full of concrete examples.  A "must read" 
 This was the hit of Christmas Eve.  I gave one to my brother and husband and everyone one wanted one.  It projects light way out in front of you and is a must have for power outages and walking in the evening. Great product.  I am ordering several more 
  This magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men. It has everything you want, including hot babes, cars, gadgets, and sexy bikinis. It is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff, like the new watches they showed by Fossil and DKNY, and some excellent Martini recipes, and then they turned me on to a DVD called "NEW SEX NOW"   which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies.  I, for one, am hooked. 
 GOLDWATER IS THE FATHER OF RONALD REAGA 
 Not only are the soups tasty and inventive; but they are sensible and nutritious. They require little time and ingredients that are neither exotic, nor hard to find. Most recipe books are loaded with expensive ingredients that necessitate driving 20 miles from your home, and that you use only for one particular recipe. I want recipes that use inexpensive stuff I have on hand, or will have no trouble finding. This book meets those requirements. I read cookbooks like other people read novels, and this is the best cookbook I've ever had. Now that he's conquered the soup pot, Joe  needs to move on to pastas and more 
 Mutts is so cool and realistic in its depiction of pets and how they behave; Earl, Mooch, and Shtinky are so cute!  If you have ever owned a cat or a dog, you've got to read this great comic series!  More shtuff...Yesh 
 This is a fantastic book. You can tell that it is a motivational book of the highest quality by the fact that it has not one, but two colons in the title 
 Played it as background music at my wedding reception. Very cool, loung, relaxed, urban. 
 I have used this book over and over again.It has wonderful bread recipes,such as a malt one with raisins.The side dishes and salads are VERY easy to prepare,and none of the recipes require an umpteen number of ingredients!!Most of them take very little time to prepare,also.If you are into adding mroe grains to your diet,or expanding your repetoire of recipes,this is a great book 
 This was a really funny book. I like the twist at the end. I think that the VP was a real jerk. I cant believe some punk bands were that cool. I mean, crashing a Harley through a window holding a samuri sword? To cool. ROCK ON.    
 You should see these guys play live if you can--they have an amazing show, but if you can't then you can't go wrong with buying any of their albums.  Inside these glimpses into the soul are rousing upbeat songs (some are even funny) that will make your feet want to dance--some with lyrics others that are instrumental.  Tree features the one song that makes my heart glad when I hear it--it is the instrumental piece The Plouescat Races.  There are also heart wrenching ballads that will make you want to weep such as Black is the Colour, and well as words of wisdom such as in Before the Night is Over which speaks of living as if this night were your last.  The Crazy Goat Song (An Poc Ar Buile) is an upbeat tune sang in Gaelic.  This is one of the albums from which is would be impossible for me to be parted. I own all three of their albums and love them all.  Once you hear them you'll  be hooked 
 This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts book. I have read it several times. Luke is a great hero (even if he is a thief) and I just fell in love with him 
 The title translated into German used to be 'Schuld und Suehne' which translates into 'Guilt and Attonement'. The book appears now with the new translated title of 'Verbrechen und Strafe' which translates into 'Crime and Punishment'. What was the author really thinking by almost excusing the crime? Are we now less forgiving 
 Having practiced t'ai chi for 25 years, I can say that Master Liao's book is among the most meaningful ever written on the subject of chi. This is a book that will open a true connection to your internal life force, and begin to help you develop that energy for the good of yourself, and the world. Read this book if you have any interest in developing your inner spiritual life 
 This is a band who hit it big in the 60's with some massive hits.Their TV series was very popular,and they seemed to do no wrong earlier in their careers.But a combination of things lead to this groups downfall.Changing times was one of them,and people found out the did not play their own instruments on the recordings.These days thats common,and even back then alot of bands had outside help to make their albums.But they struggled to produce the hits after a while,their show ended,band members left till their was only 2 left.  But in those years some excellent songs were made.The Monkees Theme,Last Train To Clarksville,I'm A Believer,(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone,A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,Pleasant Valley Sunday,Daydream Believer,as well as many other hits on this cd.Another song i like which is not here called Look Out Here Comes Tomorrow is a favorite of mine.  They had some great songwriters helping them such as Neil Diamond and the Boyce and Heart team.They also had writing credits to alot of songs of their own.This group was one of the best 60's bands 
 Masatsugu Iwase-sensei is back! And none too soon. The Archangel, a state-of-the-art battle carrier, has managed to wend its way through perilous war zones thanks to young stud pilot Kira Yamato and his sidekick robot, the Strike Gundam. However, the never-ending battles take their toll on the young pilot Kira-who also suffers from horrific nightmares. While scavenging for desperately needed supplies deep in a graveyard of space colonies, the crew stumbles upon Lacus Clyne, the knock-out daughter of a high official of the Zaft Empire. Is this a good omen? Or not? When a return trip to the Earth-controlled district of Alaska goes terribly wrong, the Archangel winds up in an African desert attacked by new Zaft craft, one of which is piloted by Kira's best friend and most dangerous enemy, Athrun! Fasten your seat belts; you are in for a ride 
 Nude by Bill Blass has been my signaturefragrance since 1996.  I've been wearing it for so long that I don't even smell it anymore when I put it on.  A little behind the ears and on the pulse point on my neck and I'm good to go.  Never, ever have I ever worn a scent that garnered more compliments than Nude has for me.  People love it on me!  It's just a lovely, sexy fragrance.  However, I would recommend that, before buying it online and if you've never worn it before,  one should go to a department store and try it on first.  Get the opinion of your husband or boyfriend or good friends because fragrances tend to smell differently on different people.  My sister plopped down $40 for a bottle of Nude years ago after smelling it on me.  Her husband told her it smelled awful, LOL (now, mind you, he always complimented me when I had it on).  She ended up giving it to me and going back to what she had used before.  
 I have made more recipes from this book than from any cookbook I have ever owned.  Every recipe is quick, easy, and absolutely delicious.  Being a lifetime Weight Watcher member, I love knowing the points value of each dish and knowing that what I cook is healthy and nutritious.  Despite all the good things about each dish, i.e. quick, easy, healthy and light,  it is still scrumptious 
 This book has inspired me to redo many of our rooms usingsimple and easy to find garden-style accessories. ............... the fabulous sequel to this book, Garden Style Projects. I  may need a new house now so I can keep using all these ideas 
 Thank goodness for Max Carl!  Formerly of the killer L.A. based band, "Jack Mac & the Heart Attack,"  Carl adds a kicking west coast rock and blues vocal style not possible for any of the former "southern or country-rock" members.  In fact, .38 special was starting to sound like a formula band getting increasingly stale with every record.  Max brings fresh air to the group meaning more studio polish, better guitar and keyboard work, higher quality writing, amazing vocals -- AND THE GROUPS ONLY NUMBER ONE HIT EVER -- "SECOND CHANCE."  After Max Carl left, the group never produced another top ten hit and now plays the oldies "southern-rock" circuit.  When I e-mailed their web site and asked them about "Second Chance" they say they only perform it in a medley and loathe the Max Carl period.  It's sad, but their best work is the stuff the current band (stuck in the southern-rock mode) likes the least.  It's always been adventageous for groups to mix members -- east coast, west coast, southern, european etc.  Kind of like when the Doobies added Michael Macdonald or War added Eric Burden.  .38 special was really on to something and progressing until Max Carl left the group.  It's a shame they never developed or advanced.  Now they've regressed to being a copy of what they were back before hit maker Max Carl joined them.  They're just another boring southern-rock oldies band 
 I love exploring James Lilek's website and this book is just more of his wackiness.  A majority of the items were way before my time but I did note my not-so-beloved "carseat" in there. Nothing like being hooked to the front seat with some metal tubing and a thin plastic strap 
 Simply amazing... the multi-angle view of Instrumedley on the bonus disc is worth nearly the price of admission... but there are hidden pieces of astounding talent on display throughout the entire DVD... I don't think Dream Theater knows how to play something that's just nice, short, sweet, and simple.  They pride themselves on pushing the boundaries, and they do so brilliantly in nearly every tune they compose!  Overall this is a MUST OWN for any prog rock fan, any shred fan, any musician who plays guitar, bass, drums, or keyboard, or fan of those instruments.  My only complaint is that the guys aren't the most entertaining in the world.  To some that's a complement: "shut up and play." But if I have to fish around for a complaint, that would be it. Otherwise this DVD is simply mind boggling. 
 This cd is INSANE.......  If yall thought emenem was f**ked in the head in the slim shady days, you aint herd nothin!!!!  this is cage's debut lp, which came on eastern conferecnce records, the same label he left in 2004......  On this cd, he's got a sick a** mind, on songs like "the soundtrack" where he's talkin about havin a dream of killin his stepdad and "suicidal failure" which he talks about his previous sucicide attemts in his younger dayz..This is sum crazy death rap s**T.....too bad necro didnt recruit this dude when he had the chance...lol  "agent orange" is the highlight on this one 4 sho...    and as for tha haters that write these stupid reviews...most of yall dont even know jack about hiphop, so why even make a review about an artist you know NOTHING about?  as of now, cage is signed to definitive jux for his new record, HELLZ WINTER, which will be released sept 20th....  If ur new to cage, get this one first b4 hellz winter....  
 Just wanted to add my quick two cents regarding this album.  This is the best album from Deep Forest and is one I play regularly.  The mixture of sound and music in this album is really great.  I'm still waiting for Deep Forest to put out another album as good as this one.  None of them have come close 
 I cannot stand Ann Coulter, she's arrogant and rants on anything to offend someone. I love authors such as Susan Estrich and such that write books like this one exposing Ann for what she really is, a liar out to make a quick buck. I love this book along with other like it such as Soulless by Susan Estrich 
 He's good, what else is there to sa 
 I never thought La'Chat would ever be heard from again. There was a rumor going around my area that she was dead. But low and behold, the joy I felt when I discovered she was back! Although her sophmore album "Ultimate Revenge" isn't as wonderful as her debut ("Murder She Spoke"), Chat still shows that she is hard as she wants to be. The beats are tight and I think she's grown lyrically, and she is starting to rap at a more uptempo pace. The material is unique, and she definitly shows she can hold her own. The only reason I didn't give this album five stars is because I don't like the front cover (Her face is hidden behind sunglasses and bandanas.), and because the track list is not in exact playing order. Other than that, it's bumpin'. Keep shining, Chat 
 I usually don't like romance novels because of their predictabilty but Waller's Bridges of Madison County breaks through the genre with emotional characters and thought provoking morality questions.     The Bridges of Madison County leaves you questioning your ideals as you attempt to justify or condemn the affairs of the two main characters.  Honestly the writing is average but the setting and the purity of the character's emotions make this story work.  Clearly the most interesting aspect of this book is the polarity in peoples reactions to it.  It's a deeply personal tale and those that can relate to it probably are the ones that can appreciate it.  Does it glorify adultry?  Perhaps, but the stars were alligned in this affair which makes it easier to accept and enjoy from a readers standpoint.  Which ever side of the fence you fall on will also probably determine if you like this book or not.  I say probably because personally I disagreed with what the characters were doing but the beauty of the whole literary experience made the book enjoyable.  I guess in the end I rationalized that this was fiction and that I didn't have to take a stance.  I haven't seen the movie nor do I have any desire to since Maryl Streep and Eastwood are way too old to be these characters in my mind.  Bottom Line:  An interesting look on the dichotomy between the simplicity and complexity of a marital affair.  What some find beautifull and pure, others will find abhorent and ugly.. Bottom Lin 
 Taking the proverbial leep of faith,  "America" steps out on their own to produce this third album with no inhibitions!  "Hat Trick" is distinctively different from their debut album simply "America" or "Homecoming" yet is filled with lush overtures and sometimes complex arrangements like that of the title track.   "Wind Wave" is very flowing and the string arrangements for this cut are stupendous.  "She's Gonna Let You Down" and "Rainbow Song" are also excellent!!! Do not be fooled by the critics.  You can not compare this particular work to any of the previous or post 70's era!!!  Give it a listen!!! 
 This is a great recollection of the muscle car era with exceptional, detailed photographs.  Would look good on any coffee table 
 First published in the mid-twentieth century, Samuel Shellabarger's Captain From Castile is an enduring adventure novel about Pedro de Vargas, a young Spanish nobleman who escapes to the New World when the Inquisition denounces his family. Pedro's exciting adventures (complete with swordfights, political intrigue, and romance), make Captain From Castile a merry and panoramic narrative worthy to take its place among the literary classics 
 Hi everyone,  I positively loved this book that inspired the first movie of the Rambo trilogy, also named "First Blood"... The only one that was written before and not for the movie.  It is absolutely excellent to find out all the scenes we can remember from the movie but with a dramatically different approach of the main characters. And actually, even if you've seen it, the movie doesn't really put his pictures over the book lines you're reading.  I will say that it's the same story with another point of view.  The three main caracters : Rambo, Trottman and the sheriff are totally human thinking and not so caricaturized as a movie tends to do. Yes, you can read they thoughs!  Rambo is not only a police mistraited hero anymore and is not so gentle... Not really the "good guy" anymore.  The nature described here is far more important and scary than the movie.  But a major surprise I will not write here makes the book absolutely special and different from the movie. Just read it.  If you liked the movie you will love the book. If you hated the movie you'll like it after reading the book.  Have a good one.  @lex 
 I used to use this commentary online, and it's very insightful and hence helpful! It's also worth buying, since the structure online is a bit distorted and sometimes hard to see the outlined structure the commentary follows. The book is huge, but if you won't need to carry this around, this complete and unabridged version is probably the best choice. 
 18th century California was a time of prejudice. Walk Across the Sea, centers around independent Eliza Jane, a young teenage girl who lives with her parents in a northern California lighthouse. When a mysterious Chinese immigrant boy saves her goat from the California waters, she tries to find him to pay him back. She soon learns that prejudice surrounds the Chinese by the people of her town. Along the way helping her is her brave and helpful friend Sadie, her open minded and kind neighbor, Dr Wilton and her pet goat Parthenia.   This story has a mix of friendship, prejudice, religion, compassion, and morality. This out of the ordinary story shows prejudice back then and gives lessons on how we can be rid of prejudice today. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested about life in general. Walk Across the Sea makes you think about things that you normally wouldn't think about in life. You learn you always have to been open minded and very conscious of other people and their beliefs. If you want to read a different story, Walk Across the Sea is for you! I also recommend ALL books in the Dear America, My Name Is America, and Royal Diaries Series 
 I own the book and the CD. This book takes you right down the streets. Roy Blount Jr. makes you feel like you are right there with him. This really makes you smile. I love driving and listening to his book 
 The best work of Renaissance never strayed far from the symphonic style of  19th and 20th century music.  Scheherazade & Other Stories, certainly one of the band's most ambitious recordings, saw the band using their classical roots to produce one of the signature albums of 1970's progressive rock.  Unlike other prog-rock groups, Renaissance eschewed much of the technology in favor of acoustic instruments and orchestral arrangements.  Electric guitars and synthesizers were seldom used, giving the band's music more of a symphonic sweep.    This is not to say that Renaissance was without talented musicians.  John Tout was an accomplished pianist and his work is well represented on Scheherazade & Other Stories. Jon Camp innovative bass lines often provided the melodic structures for the songs. And of course, Annie Haslam's ethereal vocals were the musical centerpiece of the band.  Renaissance was an incredibly talented ensemble and featured one of the loveliest voices in rock music.  
 No affairs. No criminal connections. No DNA. No clues. Eve Dallas may be the best cop in the city--not to mention having the lavish resources of her husband, Roarke, at her disposal--but the Swisher case has her baffled. The family members were murdered in their beds with brutal, military precision. The state-of-the-art security was breached, and the killers used night vision to find their way through the cozy middle-class house. Clearly, Dallas is dealing with pros. The only mistake they made was to overlook the nine-year-old girl cowering in the dark in the kitchen....  Now Nixie Swisher is an orphan--and the sole eyewitness to a seemingly inexplicable crime. Kids are not Dallas's strong suit. But Nixie needs a safe place to stay, and Dallas needs t solve this case. Not only because of the promise she made to Nixie. Not only for the cause of justice. But also to put to rest some of her own darkest memories--and deepest fears. With her partner Peabody on the job, and watching her back--and with Roarke providing the kind of help only he can give--Lieutenant Eve Dallas is running after shadows, and dead set on finding out who's behind them 
 Former Clinton Administration Labor Secretary Robert Reich argues that a tiny handful of people spun the media and American politics so we are more worried about private morality than the more substantially damaging corporate welfare.   His version of the good state examines the foundations of this country. Reich then concludes that liberalism is the American tradition and thus is still beneficial for the country. Furthermore, he argues that a majority of the people are in fact liberals.   It is the centrism and waffling among some Democrats which ironically confuses people about what liberalism is and who liberals are. Those actions prevent the voters from seeing that liberals are in fact human beings and they themselves are among the group.   The 'waffling' undertaken to reach 'swing voters' subsequently prompts a larger segment of voters to go to Radcons--even though those people are themselves the classic lions in sheep's clothing.  Radcons are only interested in getting and maintaining power over other people at all costs, they really don't give a flip about the common person.   Reich's words are inspiring in these times. Specifically because this man does believe in America, he wants us to go beyond sound bites and have America's actions demonstrate how great it is. We could save time and money on 'image consulting' if we remembered that other countries (especially in the computer/e-news era) look at our actions much more closely than the image make over of the second.    Reich's book is a thoughtful and articulate work. It needs to be in everybody's collection.  
 Just like others have reviewed, you can't expect to hear a "Leave a Whisper II."  Mostly because Shinedown is the kind of band who makes good music, and good music is not the same as in the last track or as in the last CD.  If you think about it, anybody's favorite CD is a favorite because each track has a different personality and chemestry.  CDs that sound the same are always boring and lose people's interest immediately.  So why would anybody want to hear something that sounds just like their first CD? Shinedown managed to make an entire good CD with "Leave a Whisper" and they did it again with "Us & Them."    I'm not going to lie, when I heard the cd for the first time, my first thought was "this is so radio material."  But the more I listened to the cd, the more I got convinced that they just got better.  It's not that they sold out, it's that they improved so much more as musicians.    In other words, looks like Shinedown just gets better and better, and I can't wait for a third CD 
 This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes 
 Very interesting book about the differences in Korean culture and how to fit in in a new culture.  Some editing mistakes, but a good read 
 Loved this Gothic tale of an alchemist who invents a way to live for ever, then later realizes it is a curse.  Lots of dark castles in Eastern Europe, Spain and other "mysterious" places with references to real people and events from the 16th to the 18th centuries.  Good writing, clever unpredicatble plot 
 Loved its look and feel... while I don't know much about using a compass, this one has all the parts needed to be a top notch "explorer".  GPS is for sissies 
 I grew up in Japan and I was a huge fan of its orginal TV series in 70s.  I am plesantly surprised how anime has been changed from the ones I used to watch when I was a kid.  Story is very sophicitecated in this short series.  Music is good as well.  I like the designs of machines better than its originals, but not of the people...(Casshan looks too young, Casshan's mother almost looks like his girlfriend, and Luna is showing too much of her body.)  Still, Casshan has been my hero for over 30 years!  I bet he will be your hero once you watch this DVD 
 If you are looking for a book to help you learn the art of watch repair this is the one, great book 
 This book has been a tremendous encouragement and help to me as a parent.  There are so many books out there on parenting and at times the advice contradicts and confuses.  Reading this book has taken me back to the basics. I was reminded of what an awesome responsibility and privilege I have being a parent!  I can strongly recommend this book to any parent! 
 Did a lot of research both on-line and in local stores, looked at Sharp Aquos, Philips and Samsung (all 37", due to space constraints). Sony Bravia comes in 32" and 40", went with smaller, 32" Bravia because of clarity and color - would rather have smaller Sony quality product than larger of other brands.  Great resolution. Easy to use out of box. Have had it for two months and are very happy with product. Only "complaint" is that when put on "mute" is does not close-caption 
 This was delivered quickly - in excellent condition -- thank 
 I love the Muppet Movies and the Muppet Christmas Carol is one I can watch again and again and again.  Highly recommend for people who enjoy Kermit and Miss Piggy 
 This book is a smash hit. You need some familiarity with basic science and mathematical concepts.  The book gives one a sense of awe at man's struggle to understand the physical world and the  achievement these equations represent.  Such a great idea it's a wonder it hasn't been done before. I enjoyed every page.  It had been a long time since I discovered and thought about these "icons" during undergraduate studies.  
 If you have ever had the pure pleasure of visiting the Monterey Bay area, you will never forget what a magical place it is!  Luckily, Sureel Elements has put together the next best thing to being there whether you want the memories in your home year round, or if you want to experience it without making the trip to California.  It is a beautiful, soothing and relaxing DVD that will bring all the magic of Monterey snapshot by snapshot into your living room!!  It is better than any home movie or photo album could ever provide.....I wish every place I visit offered this kind of momento!  
 Very useful for everybody who needs to have understanding about finance and accounting in thier day-to-day tasks. Clearly shows how managerial budgets are linked to financial reports. Furthermore it gives a basis to understand and read financial reports and takes out the important information needed for the daily management decisions and follow-ups.  The book takes you step by step and on a comprehensive way through all the necessary knowledge and skills you should have. 
 The stpry is amazing enough, a former slave teaching a horse how to do sums, spell out words, deliver mail, etc.  What makes Mim Eichler Rivas' book so interesting is the larger context she manages to place the story in.  As the subtitle says, these are the horse and the man "who changed the world."  And the way they did so is by aligning themselves with the ASPCA and other organizations dedicated to changing the way we think about animals.  It is hard to transport ourselves back into the middle of the 19th century and to see animals the way people back then did, but Eichler Rivas puts us there.  It is no accident that novels like BLACK BEAUTY and BEAUTIFUL JOE became best-sellers in the last quarter of the century--it is because they were sponsored, and even shoved down people's throats, by the big humane societies (as Eichler Rivas describes it, both books seem to have been written to order, to shock people out of their ordinary habits of cruelty to animals--horses in the one case, dogs in the other).  These books were the animal counterparts to the abolitionist best-seller UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, written as agitprop to convey social messages, and if they seem clumsy today (though actually all three are strong in construction and in detail) that is to be forgiven I suppose.  The whole "back story" of the way the novel was used by progressive organizations back then is fascinating, and it makes you wonder if such a feat could be duplicated today.  This book, BEAUTIFUL JIM KEY, is filled with different "back stories" that sort of distract you from the essential unbelievability of the horse's great feats.  At the end of the day, I remain skeptical, not 100 % convinced that a horse COULD be taught all those things.  Because of this nagging doubt (get it--"nagging"?) I would rate this book a notch below SEABISCUIT, which is an incomparable feat of literature.  However, it is a story in a million and not to be missed but anyone who loves animals or Americana.  I had the pleasure of reading A PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER a few months ago, by Victor Rivers, the story of a young Cuban-American's child abuse, and now I find out that author is married to the author of BEAUTIFUL JIM KEY.  They must be the most accomplished literary couple since, well, Will and Ariel Durant. 
  The epic feature of a doctor against the oppressive tyranny of the Russians after the invasion of Praga in 1968 will work out as the big frame in order he decides to turn off the reality evading it through the love with two women who are each one complement of the another one. Sabine is somehow, the embodiment of the mature woman and Teresa is the sweet bird of youth whose charm will engage to Tomas who will realize he will not be able to live without the love of both of them.  Notable adaptation, zealously depicted and best acted. The masterpiece of Philipe Kaufman.    
 If you were fascinated with the movie and fond of 1980's genre of femenistic rock and roll then you will most likely fall in love with the original soundtrack. And The original score of seventeen compilations is as dark as is it intoxicating. So cherish Donnie Darko with the captivating original soundtrack and score 
 This selection is an absolte great one.  It is great for parties and just to scare the bejesus out of people.  It is not, I dare say, one that you would want to listen to over and over again.  It repeats itself in many tracks, but for fun, you've got to have this one 
 This very technical guide will reach beyond the arts to any involved in color photography or the science of reproduction: Principles Of Color Reproduction covers the underlying principles of successful color reproduction, masking methods, tone reproduction and influences on color results, with many formulas covering densities, color separation and balance, and calculations for reflection. Very technical and perfect for the college-level art school library 
 All my kids love Sesame Street. I love that they watch it and learn from them. I'd rather them watch Sesame Street than those Violent Japanese cartoons that teach our children violence instead of numbers and letters. These oldies but goodies should be in every house that has DVD's. You can't go wrong with Sesame Street, no matter what the title 
 I bought this for my husband for Father's Day as well as the Von Bondies CD and he absolutely LOVES both CD's!!! It was nice to read the insert and have it written by Denis Leary himself.  He gave credit to his son for choosing the Von Bondies song...looks like his son is on the road to a successful career in music just like his dad is in television 
 This book revealed a very personal side of prayer in the life of a believer.  It gave the reader insight into the power of fervent, consistent and continuous praying.  It is a wonderful lesson and experience in "learning how to pray".  I would recommend this book to all persons interested in learning how to pray, especially those who are struggling in their prayer life.  
 I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series of books, I just wish the author had had time to write more of them 
 Since his assassination in 1967, George Lincoln Rockwell has become a rather obscure footnote in American history.  However, over the course of the last decade of his life, Rockwell was -- for many -- the living epitome of modern evil and his influence as a political extremist, racist, and agitator has continued long after his own death.  As the founder of the American Nazi Party, Rockwell came to represent, for many, the dark side of America in the 1960s.  William H. Schmaltz's intriguing, if not quite definitive, biography attempts to reveal just how and why Rockwell came into existence but also why his story remains important to this day.  Arguably, it's probably impossible to truly understand a character like Rockwell who, as Schmaltz shows, appears to only be comfortable when playing a role (in this case, that of a Nazi).  We're given clues to understanding what fueled Rockwell's brand of agitation.  We learn that his father was a veteran of vaudeville (and much of Rockwell's agitation was more meant to be theatrical than actual political activism) and that Rockwell, even before achieving his dubious fame, always seemed to feel the need to be the center of attention.  They're intriguing clues and Schmaltz certainly offers a convincing portrait of an unstable man who was eventually imprisoned by his own impulsively concieved image but one still finishes the book unsure as to just what was truly behind Rockwell's seemingly unending hatred.  As well, Rockwell's own death -- at the hands of a former American Nazi named John Patler -- is handled almost as an after thought.  Beyond providing evidence that Patler was obviously unstable, Schmaltz doesn't provide much detail or speculation as to what ultimately led to Rockwell's murder.  Indeed, the book mostly becomes a year-by-year accounting of the activities of American Nazi Party and it is here that the book excels.  While the '60s are lionized as a time of nonstop political activism, it is sometimes forgotten that not all of that activism was being done on the side of the Angels.  Much of the political activism of the '60s was fueled not be idealism but by anger, not by love but by hatred.  The final impression of George Lincoln Rockwell that one gets from Schmaltz's book is that of a racist, Swastika-sporting Abbie Hoffman.  Beyond ideology, there seems to be little difference between the gun-toting, conflicted men who made up Rockwell's American Nazi Party and the Weathermen who plotted to blow up buildings in the name of peace.  This is where Schmaltz's book provides it's strongest service -- he convincingly shows how a small group of extremists can, in times of chaos and with a charismatic leader, go from being a bunch of alienated losers to a true danger.  It's an important lesson, made all the more powerful and pretinent by Schmaltz's refusal to either demonize or sanitize Rockwell and his followers.  Hate is an important, compelling look at one of the most important fringe figures in American history.  Even if, by the book's end, the reader is truly no closer to understanding what created George Lincoln Rockwell then before, Schmaltz still shows why it's important to remember the man's life, no matter how distasteful it may have ultimately been 
 This issue of Ascent is superior to some of the others. More professional and less flaky, it contains gripping trip reports and hilarious satire. The poetry is overall good, though very focused on the work of one author. The  photography is beautiful but too much of it is in black and white. I found  the reproduced paintings to be luridly colored and uninteresting. Overall,  though, this book is well worth reading, with highlights including  excellent work by Kelsey and Viola 
 I've been looking for some heavy glass mugs with handles for some time.  These fit the bill perfectly.  Probably wouldn't have purchased them at the regular price, but the sale price them an offer I couldn't refuse.  Well worth the price and more.  Love them 
 McKee takes us on a quick and informal survey of current popular American culture. The book was chapters by various authors, each on a particular famous object or person. One subject is which of the Batman short series comics is the best. The book suggests that it is "The Dark Knight Returns", which may already be familiar to some readers. Another chapter talks about who the best basketball player might be. The choice is Michael Jordan, which is probably correct.  As you can discern, the subject varies considerably between chapters. Another example is the choice of best action console game. Grand Theft Auto. Quite notorious to many fans and detractors.  The book won't take you long to read. 
 Received the monitor quickly.  It works well.  The automatic feature is great.  
 This is really a rather profound book.  Superficially labelled a 'literary criticism' it is more an analysis of the way in which people remember traumatic experience.  In this instance we are dealing with men-at-war--World War One, predominantly (with an occasional study of its influence on World War II participants' subsequent memories) and the ways in which a tremendous number of authors broke away from the traditional self-mythologizing so many previous wars' histories tended to evoke.  It was here that people started to speak in public critically of the decisions of their superiors, both in the military and in government.  This book attempts to record the ways in which aggrandizement was altered, made into individually heroic scenes of defiance or love instead of an increasingly tired defense of God and Kingdom.  What is really being explored is the ways in which the modern world has changed from a generally considered 'glorious past' into a disillusioned report from the trenches.  This idea transcends war and imposes itself upon everyday life.  This is an important notion to consider seriously as the present glooms on.  A very important book disguised as something not many people would think about reading 
 Incredible DVD.  James Earl Jones' voice overs are great.  It's only of 8 and 16mm video footage with NOTHING else!   What a great way to watch a  movie!  It's very well done, lots of cool little facts and tidbits about  the good ol days.  For example, before the 1940s, players used to just  leave their gloves on the field when they went in to bat.  They even have  footage showing this.  Something you never would've known or seen  otherwise.  I can't wait for the other 2 to come out on DVD 
 Drazen has written a good, introductory book on anime.  As such, it doesn't do a spectacular job on anything, but it covers most of the bases well.  In general it treats the movies as art and covers sociology and culture only sparingly.  This book should be read by people who are new to anime and have limited experience with it.  For newbies it does a good job of giving them a handle on the genre so they can look an anime with some idea of what's going on. People with a stronger background in the field will probably be bored and likely to nitpick the book to death.  In particular some of the generalizations are likely to annoy anyone with a serious background in anime 
 If you've ever been to Germany and been introduced to someone whose title was Professor Doctor Doctor Doctor and you were required not to smile as you listened to the introduction, this is your book.  Academics in general take themselves too seriously, and Alexander McCall Smith draws on his years of experience in academia to lampoon the worst excesses.    The humor is rather broad and obvious, but it does hit the mark.  Those who aren't exposed to academics may wonder what all of the fuss is about.    These are a series of eight stories about Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld (think hedgehog field) and his colleagues.  With enormous self-confidence, the three professors decide to learn tennis by reading a book in the Principles of Tennis.  Von Igelfeld launches his fellow student and future colleague into a dangerous form of sport with humorous and unexpected consequences in Duels, and How to Fight Them.  Early Irish Pornography shows the potential absurdity of studying just any old language if you are a philologist.  Italian Matters explores the bases of national prejudices.  Portuguese Irregular Verbs explores the immense over-investment that all authors have in their work.  Holy Man explores how the rational man meets the mystic and what he makes of the experience.  Dental Pain looks into professorial romantic ideas.  Death in Venice tickles one's fancy with references to Thomas Mann.    If you like the Botswana stories, these stories will probably not appeal as much.  There's bile and vague pity beneath the humor here rather than love for the characters 
 Great music.  Christian with an edge is so neat.  I love this C 
 Historian and columnist Tom Segev contributes to the long series of books on the Middle-East with a book that fascinates and thrills. It made me look at Israel and the country's near history with new eyes. This small book makes you reflect on accepted truths and myths about the country and it's inhabiltants. Segev's book represents  someting new and different, and inspired me to buy a couple of other of his books on the subject. Consider "Elvis in Jerusalem: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel" an appetizer for further reading of this "new historian's" books.   
 This book is actually a series of letters that Laura wrote while visiting her daughter Rose.  Rose Wilder Lane is a married journalist living in San Francisco.  After years of begging her parents to visit her in this exciting, bustling city, Laura finally decides to go, but Almanzo must stay  home and tend their farm at Rocky Ridge.  These letters are sent to  Almanzo, telling him of the World's Fair, riding the streetcars, and other  exciting activities in the city.  This book is really enlightening and  educational.  We get to see early San Francisco thru the eyes of our  favorite pioneer. Children may not enjoy the letter form, but adults fans  of the "Little House" series will enjoy connecting with Laura  again 
 I remember the first time I realized that James Baldwin was a genius. I picked up one of Angela Davis's autobiographies. I found one of the most beautifully crafted letters ever exchanged from one writer to another.   And with one five page letter, I fell in love.  I am certain that The Price of the Ticket must be one of the greatest collections of essays ever bound into a single volume. If someone would like to challenge that, please be my guest. And, I believe that James Baldwin is probably the second most widley quoted African American writer in epithets, speeches and dedications after Martin Luther King. I admit, I have no statistical data to support these claims. I have no quantitative proof. Just keep your eyes and ears open and you will understand what I mean. Whether it was the text Many Thousands Gone I read in An African History course on Slavery, or the article entitled The Price of the Ticket that I discovered in my Art History course. Baldwin has left an indelible mark on history.   James warned us that, "It is very nearly impossible, after all, to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind." (The Can't Turn Back)   He proved to us that, "freedom is not something that anybody can be given; freedom is something people take and people are as free as they want to be." (Notes for a Hypothetical Novel)   Long before Morrison & Cose explanation of the Envy of the World we knew, "alas, that to be an American Negro Male is also to be a kind of walking phallic symbol: which means that one pays, in one's own personality, for the sexual insecurity of others." (The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy)   Before Mumia reminded us Baldwin informed us, "What passes for identity in America is a serise of myths about one's heroic ancestors. It's astounding to me, for example that so many people really appear to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free." (A Talk to Teachers)   And years later we still have not grasped the fact that, "Guilt is a luxury we can no longer afford." (Words of a Native Son)   Perhaps Genovese was smiling when Baldwin wrote, "We won our Christianity, our faith, at the point of a gun, not because of the example afforded by white Christains, but in spite of it. It was very difficult to become a Christian if you were a black man on a slave ship, and the slave ship was called "The Good Ship Jesus."   Perhaps the scarriest thing that Baldwin has showed us, is how seldom things change.  Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent. Talent is not to be ignored. Dreams are to be followed, Challenges are to be faced and Art is to be created. 
 What a great movie. good time you have watchign this one. Its a one of a kind movie. if your a star wars or star gate fan like my girlfriend, you will truly like this movie. its the only sci-fi movie with ''sad'' part in it. really good movie suited for nearly anyone. watch this one with your girlfriend rather then your beer drinking pals. 
 Robert Cameron's book is breathtaking and very beautiful. Natives of the City, tourists and new citizens of NYC will love this book, because it gives you a prospective of the city that most visitors never see. The  photos are a graphic map to the avenues, streets, parks and buildings that  are a part of this great American city. The pictures are sharp and clear.  The color is vivid and thought provoking. This is a must for anyone who  would like to know more about New York City. This is a great addition to  anyone's library and it is a real conversation piece 
 I bought this collection at the same time I bought the "Atomic Bomb Collection".  I found these two packages to be very complimentary.  While the "Atomic Bomb Collection" contained documentaries focusing on nuclear weapons development and testing that were intended for general audiences (very good, by the way), this collection contains documentaries prepared by the US government as technical briefings for military and other government personnel.  They provide a lot of interesting information, although it is likely to be a little more technical than some may prefer.  But anyone with a high school level understanding of science can easily follow what's presented.  One will learn a lot about nuclear weapons and their effects from these films.  Personally, I found them fascinating, and I'm sure I will watch them again to improve my understanding and address new questions that may arise in my mind.  For those interested in science, Cold war history, or technological development, I recommend these films highly.  p.s.:  The documentaries are from the late 50's, and they are presented in the style that was common in those days.  That, in and of itself, is an interesting look back for the historian 
 Authors Frank Kemerer and Jim Walsh have written one of those "must-haves" that belongs in your professional library. If you are an educator in Texas, you need this book. Readable and thorough, the  book touches all areas of concern, with emphasis on how the law applies in  Texas. Kemerer is Regents Professor of Education Law and Administration at  UNT and Walsh is senior partner in the Walsh, Anderson, Underwood, Schulze  & Alderidge firm which has been heavily involved with districts across  the state for some time now. This one is a needful reference, no matter  what you level you teach 
 I just came back from Russia would like to learn more.  It is very good reference film.  
 I took this book with me on a recent trip to Central America and absolutely loved it.  While there is less narrative flow than, say, A Walk in the Woods, reading Bryson's thoughts on Sydney harbor, Australian-rules football, former Prime Minister Harold Holt (peace be upon him), forever walking through Canberra, and his near run-in's with a seemingly endless list of nasty (and apparently deadly) native animals was engaging and thoroughly enjoyable.  He does this all the while encountering some pretty terrific and endearing folks, drinking many Victorian Bitters, and relaying an impressive and affectionate recounting of Australian history.  There really is a lot to like here.  So much so that upon finishing the book while still in Central America, and realizing that I committed the unpardonable sin of only bringing one book with me to read (you try finding a decent bookstore in Central America), I turned to the first chapter and started all over again.  And it was equally engrossing, witty, and informative if not more-so.  I can think of no higher compliment for a book and I recommend it whole-heartedly. 
 This book was a lifeline for me during my last pregnancy.  Although it was my 4th time expecting a baby, being over 35 does change the way you react both physically and emotionally to pregnancy.  The book is meant to be personalized to your particular pregnancy, with spaces for you to write the dates and record your emotions and physical feelings each week. The author is an over 35 mother herself and she discusses her personal history of loss and infertility just as if she were a close personal friend helping you navigate your own pregnancy.  The analogies to help you picture what your baby looks like are especially innovative (she uses food items as examples of weight and length) and really gives you a peek into what's happening inside you when you can't actually see it yourself 
 This is a thoughtful book which does not leave much out until you get to the index on pages 740-742.  The pages are long horizontally, usually presenting text and a large number running from 1 on the page after page 5 to 365 on the page two pages before page 736.  The index lists the big numbers only, the "Take" number.  Are punching bags in the index?  No.  Is Jean-Michel Basquiat in the index?  Yes, for six Takes under "Basquiat, Jean-Michel" and for three of the same Takes under "Jean-Michel Basquiat" (portraits, only one of which includes "and urine on canvas").  Is The Last Supper in the index?  Yes, for three Takes.  Do any of the Takes listed for Jean-Michel Basquiat coincide with Takes listed for The Last Supper?  No, neither three or six, none!  Which Take has ten punching bags?  Take 255!!!  How many times is Take 255 in the index?  Just once, for "Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper)."  Obviously, to use the index you need to know precisely what you are looking for.  In my previous review of a DVD on Andy Warhol as a great artist of the 20th century, I believe I understated how many times the word "JUDGE" appears on the ten punching bags.  In the view shown in the photo in Take 255, I can count 5 times on the first, 6 times on the second, then 3, 5, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3, and 4 times, respectively, on the third to the tenth bag.  Most of the bags look black and white, but the eighth bag has a blue crown or dark halo which might obscure a second "JUDGE" or "JESUS," a blue shape like a torso with head, the words "LEAD" and "ASBESTOS" and possibly BS, with a copyright insignia after the "JUDGE" at the bottom of the eighth punching bag.  The bags are hanging so close together that a physics student is bound to wonder how many bags would start swinging if viewers had the opportunity to give a bag on one end a good punch into the rest of the line.  The head of Christ appears to be largest on the first, fifth, and sixth punching bags, with the second and eighth having the smallest heads, to produce a standing wave effect even when the 14 inch diameter by 42 inch long bags are hanging stationary from chains to big beams in the ceiling.  The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh used to be a big warehouse, and Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper) might still be hanging there, because Entry 255 is not listed in the Photograph Credits, unless the bags are included in the bragging rights claimed by "Except where otherwise noted, ownership of all material is The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh."  (p. 742).  I hope they never catch me walking into that place with my practice gloves on 
 This important book by Stephen B. Johnson of the University of North Dakota's Space Studies Department, skillfully interweaves technical details and fascinating personalities to describe the rise of systems management in the U.S. and Europe. It is a very important work that uses Apollo as its key example. Only through the application of sophisticated management concepts were such a complex activity as the Apollo Moon landings accomplished.  Reviewers received Johnson's work warmly and it has been accepted as an exceptionally important study of how Apollo technology succeeded. As Erik Rau of Drexel University commented: "[Systems management (SM)] forced new temporal and financial discipline on contractors and engineers, imposed practices that undermined functional organization and loyalties, and subjected to scrutiny all institutions and firms involved in the project. Schedule and cost slippages on large government-sponsored projects may have continued, but Johnson asserts that SM minimized their rate. In fact, Johnson persuasively argues that without the bureaucracy of SM, success on several large aerospace projects would have been unlikely" ("Enterprise & Society" 3 (2003): 372-74).  While Johnson argued that systems management allowed the accomplishment of large-scale technological endeavors such as Apollo, it did not do so on the cheap. Costs rise as the engineering team manage for schedule and reliability, since they are interrelated and must be managed as a group. This held true for the Apollo program. The schedule, dictated by the president, was firm. Since humans were involved in the flights, and since the president had directed that the lunar landing be conducted safely, the program managers placed a heavy emphasis on reliability.   Accordingly, Apollo used redundant systems extensively so that failures would be both predictable and minor in result. The significance of both of these factors forced the third factor, cost, much higher than might have been the case with a more leisurely lunar program such as had been conceptualized in the latter 1950s. As it was, Johnson concludes, this was the price paid for success under Kennedy's lunar landing mandate. Of course, understanding the management of complex structures for the successful completion of multifarious complex tasks was an important outgrowth of the Apollo effort.  This is a critically important book in the historiography of Project Apollo and human spaceflight. It is must reading for anyone interested in the evolution of spacefaring in the last fifty years. I recommend it highly as a worthy study of the history of the systems management that allowed the success the Apollo program 
 What can I say? Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are brilliant! I have seen it in 1985 and again now! anything of true quality goes tru time and becomes a classic. Back to the future is! Indeed, the humor is great, the action clean and fun and some good one liners. It shows that we do not need gratuitous violence like in some of the movies now, to have a really Must movie to see even have 
 Having living in Poverty with "fear of failure" to being the first Afro-American to win the Academy Award and being knighted by Queen Elizabeth, Poitier gained awesome fame! He started with The Blackboard Jungle, copied after early Teacher, to A Patch of Blue, Lilies of the  Field, Raisin in the Sun, To Sir With Love, then onto Guess Who's Coming to Dinner! After being with Hepburn and Tracy his way into the Movie world became easier.   His manner and way of life seems always to be under the microscope and yet he maintains his restraint & resolve to be "I'm the Me I chose to be!" I am one who was made better for being the "Me I chose to be" in reading Sir Sidney Poitier! Retired Chaplain Fred W Hoo 
 Well to tell you the truth dawgs, I don't really remember much of this movie. I was blitzed 
 It is so nice to have something Gentle in the world... sweet... calm... That's Mutts. Life is not ONLY about blowing things up... zombies... hit men... etcetera. This is a fantastic collection and can be read by all 
 "'Taming American Power' - Why would one like to do that?" This seems to be the standard tongue-in-cheek reaction one gets from a fellow American student who has spotted the reviewer reading Stephen Walt's latest book. Granted, it is a bit hard to swallow Walt's line of argument at first. As the author, academic dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, himself admits, "by virtually any measure, the United States enjoys an asymmetry of power unseen since the emergence of the modern state system." And more than that: It is highly likely that it will remain the most powerful player in the international system for some time to come. So who would go about trying to tie down this omnipotent Gulliver? Walt does a good job in pointing out that reactions from across the world to America's "primacy" position (the author defines this as "being first in order, importance, or authority") are often lukewarm at best - large parts of the population in the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and Asia do as a matter of fact detest everything the United States stands for. And even seemingly close allies in Europe and Asia look like they have lost their (Cold War-) love for Mr. Big.  But is it just the "rise in the power of [modern-day] Athens and the fear it causes in the world" that makes America so unloved at the present moment? According to Walt, who is a neo-realist at heart but doesn't shy away from making use of other theoretical models on the way, the answer to the question of "why they hate us" is not so much what America stands for, but what it has done in the past, especially ever since the George W. Bush Administration took office in 2001. But his seminal book is more than just one of the many polemics on the current executive. It is a lucid, and often provocative, account of the current problems U.S. public diplomacy faces in the world. It is a profound analysis of the way states deal with American power, something that "has become an essential element of statecraft for every country in the world." More importantly, Walt gives clear recommendations for policy action as well, something that is so often missing from comparable works.  The author starts by shedding light on how the U.S. got into the position it is recently in. How did the "preponderance of power" (Melvin Leffler) come about? Walt attributes geography, shrewd diplomacy, but also pure luck for the unique situation America is in now. Starting with the end of the Cold War (here an analysis of earlier developments such as the Spanish-American War might have brought further insights) Walt goes through the development in the growth of U.S. influence and primacy. He then sets out to analyze the difference in perception the United States has of itself and that other states have of it. Americans and their political leaders are quite often ignorant of the fact that their country is not well liked in other parts of the world. Worse than that: On a regular basis, they simply do not care about other states' opinions. Walt considers the various strategies that states use if they indeed intend to oppose U.S. primacy. Balancing ("soft balancing" with other states or "internal balancing" on their own), balking (foot-dragging), binding (using norms and institutions), blackmail (threatening to take some undesirable action unless the U.S. offers compensation), and delegitimation (portraying the U.S. as morally bankrupt) are the various means that states put to use, very often in combination with each other and during different time periods. Although theses categories have large explanative value per se, it is however not quite clear whether they really cover the entire spectrum of political action. For example, a state could just refuse to hear what the U.S. has to say, thereby falling under none of the above categories.   But what if a state decides to go along with U.S. primacy? According to Walt, it can then either bandwagon (appease), follow a regional balancing strategy (use the U.S. to balance against neighboring states), bond with (establish close personal ties) or try and penetrate American politics (manipulate the U.S. domestic political system). But here, too, other categories seem to exist. A state can for example go along with U.S. policies while at the same time thinking very little of the nation's administration or even its president. The relationship between former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter serves as a prime example.  It is at this point that Walt gets to the heart of his controversial reasoning. He lays out an argument against political pressure groups and ethnic lobbyist movements - in itself not necessarily a new argument. Yet although he also talks about the Indian and Armenian lobby groups, his main thrust is directed against the various kinds of Israeli groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA). He blames them for having an undue influence and for pursuing a national interest that is "national" only in Israeli, not in American terms. Yet his argument about the "power of the weak" rings a bit hollow and is only thinly veiled by devoting very few pages to the Indian and the Armenian case. Although Walt rightly states that a solution to the problems of the Middle East is essential to "win the hearts and minds" of the Muslim world and to achieve one of the main objectives of U.S. foreign policy, he walks on thin ice when he makes sweeping statements about the influence of the Israel lobby in the United States such as "Israel is the `gold standard' by which transnational penetration should be judged."  Granted, the road for the solution of the Israel-Palestinian problem did not "lead through Baghdad" - U.S. involvement in Iraq turned into a quagmire situation, as Walt rightly points out. But does it really lead through K Street in Washington, D.C.? This seems hardly likely. Lobbies are influential, especially in the United States, but they surely cannot be the sole explanatory variable for why America has so many problems with public opinion in the world.  Bearing these caveats in mind, Walt is at his best when he comes to the actual policy recommendations in the last part of his book. Most importantly, he states, U.S. foreign policy "must be molded with [other states'] reactions in mind." Although this might sound like a truism to European ears, it is something that has not always been at the center of the U.S. foreign policy decision making process. There is hope, however: Consulting with allies and taking their opinions into consideration seems to have been taken up by the current U.S. administration recently - just look at the State Department's new efforts in "transformational diplomacy", increased student exchange and language learning. Walt also makes the important point that the strategy of "pre-emption" - which really is just another word for "preventive war" when the Bush administration uses it - must be abolished at earliest convenience if the U.S. doesn't want to ruin relations with the rest of the world in the long run. For large parts of the global public (especially the European part of it), this seems to be a matter of highest urgency.  The drawback of Taming American Power is that its analysis is extremely state-centered. It is perfectly alright to view states as the principal actors in international relations, but even the most hard-boiled realists will have to acknowledge that the U.S. will increasingly have to deal with non-state actors such as al-Qaeda in the future. Also, Walt seems to be a bit too sympathetic to John Mearsheimer's theory of "offensive Realism" to make it fit with his call for a "mature U.S. foreign policy" that takes the opinions of others into account when pursuing policy goals. It is because of theses inconsistencies that Walt's analysis can only serve as a starting point. But it is a good starting point and leads into the right direction. Therefore, it can be recommended highly. 
 I ordered this for my boss. He said it gave him some direction for a project he is working on. 
 What a gem of a book. My 7-year-old loved it, and my 5-year-old has practically memorized it. Great lesson, well taught, and what kid couldn't use tips on how to deal with bullying 
 I enjoyed this book, but it was a slow read.  I thought it was interesting how Swan smuggled in the 70's, but I'm sure none of these techniques would work today--if for no other reason, the cocaine-sniffing dogs!  The author writes very well, but he was so sharp and witty, that I'm afraid a lot of those witticms flew right over my head, and I had to re-read many times to figure out what was meant, and even then, sometimes couldn't 
 There is no single definition for perfectness, however Tosca with this album, achieved a perfection. Whenever I listed to it from the very "Peal In" to the "Pearl Off" I go to another place. The tunes, the beats everything work together. The whole album is a harmony, and I suggest listening to the album as a whole. Many songs stand out, however together I believe the effect is exponential 
 "Field-sequential" or "alternating-image" 3-D isn't a new idea on video.  The biggest push for it was in the mid-80s by JVC for their VHD format.  That format didn't make it in the US, but many of the 3-D movies they transferred have been endlessly copied to make bootleg tapes and DVDs.  Since then, other movies have been released in that format, but they're all either shot on video with a NuView camcorder adaptor, "converted" from 2-D movies, or a few CGI IMAX 3-D movies.  None of the many films photographed in 3-D over the last fifty years or so are available in good, legit 3-D DVDs.  Until now, that is.  This disc marks a major stride forward for the format.  Here we have a nice, clean, well-registered transfer of a 3-D film presented in 3-D.  How good is the 3-D and the transfer?  Pretty darn good.  The transfer is slightly narrower than the movie was intended to be.  I'm told this is because there were some problems with the film that made it necessary to crop it down a bit.  Overall, it came out OK, but there are several scenes that have action too near the edge of the screen.  Even on a non-overscanning display, it's a bit too tight.  As usual in 3-D movies, there are some scenes that just don't work.  That's not the fault of this disc, but it makes some scenes tough to watch.  Unfortunately, the worst shot is the very first.  It's pretty much unwatchable.  The good news is it only lasts as long as the opening credits and things pick up considerably from there.  Speaking of watching, what do you need to watch this?  To watch it on a TV, you'll need shutter glasses (not included, but widely available) and an interlaced display.  That means you can't use a plasma or LCD display and you'll need to disable progressive display on your DVD player.  If you can't do that, there are options for viewing on computers with certain combinations of hardware and software.  So the 3-D's good, how's the disc?  Other than the nice presentation of the film, the disc is plain-jane, lacking not only special features, but subtitles and closed-captions as well.  The usual 3-D setup test pattern is available, and the menus are in 3-D as well, which is nice to make sure your system is up and running right.  The disc has chapters in appropriate places.  Sounds good, but how's the movie?  Well, this review is for this disc and the 3-D presentation here- you can find plenty of reviews of the flat version here on Amazon and elsewhere.  I'm not recommending the disc for the movie itself, though if you can handle the goofy tone the filmmakers obviously intended, it's well made and fluffy enough that it's tough to be too hard on it.  And Dracula really is fantastic.  I've seen a lot of movies that were a lot worse, both in 3-D and flat.  Bottom line: for 3-D enthusiasts and collectors (and fans of this movie, I guess), this disc is a must have.  This is, hands down, the best way to watch this movie on video.  3D For Your TV could have a hit on their hands, and almost certainly will if they can find some better (or at least better known) movies for their future projects 
 This is simply one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  It catches the rhythm of life for the lonely 'invisible' people, and its emotion is conveyed so forcefully that the tragedy becomes cathartic.  Buy this book 
 Too little, too late, too generic has been my complaint on Mopar based engine books. Even the factory manuals have ignored the small block, especially the R series. At long last we have a book that at least acknowledges their existence. This manually actually focuses on the performance heads and blocks available instead of just the 30 year old factory stuff. A must have for anyone with a small block mopar 
 The product was received in great condition and timely delivered by the seller.  I would buy agai 
 I understand now! Tony forgot all the things that caused all his pain (at least he tried), yet he could not forget Hisako and her empathetic feelings about his wife. I think that's the reason he calls her in the final scene, perhaps Tony is thinking about a new beginning with Hisako. I came to understand that, Tony trying to replace his wife and somehow recreate her presence was him just fooling himself and I thought it was emotionally unhealthy. That seems to be the idea being relayed here, in a very ambiguous sort of way, not to be physically alone but to be emotionally lonely is unhealthy. This idea has been explored in films/books before.  The scene where Tony falls asleep on the floor of his wife's old closet, was transposed with a scene of his father sleeping on the prison floor from the beginning of the film, maybe that's some kind of metaphor of how loneliness can be a prison, how we create our own prisons. The director just kinda leaves the story hanging, not in the sense that it felt incomplete, it just does not deliver the ever-so coveted "happy ending", but it does leave a glimmer of hope in the fact that Tony has taken initiate and attempted to call Hisako, I thought that was brilliant and it leaves one to contemplate how we make our own choices and suggests the idea that it's in our control to obtain happiness.  The cinematography was interesting also, it gave a us a very restricted view of the characters world nevertheless we see just what we need to see. The slow panning shots got boring after awhile but it does not take away anything from this beautiful film 
 Item was recieved in excellent time and condition 
 Exercising Influence is one of the most useul books I've read in years. I'm tempted to buy a dozen or so copies as gifts for some of the miserably untalanted negotiators I've encountered in my two decades of practicing law. The book taught me two things (at least) of significant personal value:(1)The skills necessary for selling one's point of view to others can be learned; (2) These same skills overlap and improve one's abilities in the related areas of mobilizing public opinion; motivating partners, employees, and family members; communicating authority; making an impact; exercising leadership at home, in business, and in the community; getting results with and through others; implementing ideas; and making a positive difference. This eminently readable book is filled with charts, graphs, examples, tips, and instructions. What the book teaches is practical and immediately applicable to real-world situations. Kim Barnes'20 years of studying, writing about, and teaching the subject are amply in evidence in Exercising Influence. It deserves, and likely will receive, a wide and receptive readership. Five stars 
 If I could have rated this book 4 1/2 or 4 3/4 stars I would have.  It certainly is a beautiful artistic endeavor.  However, it fails the mark of perfection because of a few (VERY FEW) photos that are too suggestive for girls of their age, and a few comments by the author that would seem to provoke dangerously misleading thoughts in the minds of young people who might get their hands on this book.  As the step-dad of a teenage girl I have experienced first-hand the confusion of an easily influenced child, who lacks the full capacity to reason and misperceives what she has seen and heard.  Too many (pre-teen and teen) children think they are supposed to be sexually active, and there are certainly a few paragraphs and photos in this book that would help contribute to that pattern of thought.  There is some mild homosexual content in a few frames and some of the writings.  Otherwise this is a finely crafted work.    Many of the photos are soft, muted, elegant, and almost dream-like, while others are sharp and rich in color and contrast.  There are full figure studies and a variety of portraits.  Some of the girls look confused, content, generally happy, thrilled, curious, and some disgusted.  Unlike similar works by other photographers, the majority of the models do not appear to be emotionless, melancholy, or tormented.  There are no portrayals of violence or mishap.  The quotes from classic poetry are at times provocative but still tasteful and refreshing, especially if you are one who enjoys traditional Western European poetry.  The author/photographer makes several attempts at poetic verse but they do not work so well.    I do realize that the entire theme of The Age of Innocence is the psychological tumult experienced by young girls who are approaching womanhood, so the sexual element does have to be "taken with a grain of salt."  As an artist and photographer I do highly recommend this book and treasure my own copy, but I strongly suggest caution when selecting an audience to share it with; teenage boys are not a proper audience.    Overall this is quite a clean representation--with a few exceptions--of the human form and psychology of young women 
 This is a wonderful book full of mind and heart expanding stories of people making it in the third world. Anyone with an interest in learning about positive global forces at work should read this book. The book also brings together information on Microcredit activity from many organizations and provides a terrific handbook of resources.  It is extremely well written and quite entertaining with some great pictures 
 When I first saw this book I was not impressed - it seemed just ok.  But my now 20 month-old daughter loves it. It is definitely one of her favorite books to read.    She likes that on the right hand side you get a "preview" of which animal is coming on the next page.  She also loves to sneeze with the big bear's "Aaaaa-chew" and most of all she loves the line "and Baba smiled"  which I say to her every night before I leave her room.  It always brings a smile to her face and she happily goes off to sleep!!   
 I have owned "Brothers in Arms" since it was released in 1985, first on cassette and then on CD.  It has always been on my short list of music that comes out of my 800-plus discs to be played often.  For all of my enjoyment from this fine album over the years, it has been rendered obsolete after just a few minutes of hearing this 5.1 rendering playing through my home theater system.  The mastering is not just a faux 5.1, but a true experience that makes hearing the songs feel like it is the first time.  The rear speakers stay busy with short fills, the center speaker is pure vocal, making Knopfler's voice so clear and distinct, and when that thunder storm cracks on the title track, the sub lets you know it is really thunder, you can feel it.  For the price, you can't get a better rendering of a great album.  In short, the 5.1 DVD is a perfect way to hear this music, but at a cost.  It will make it hard to enjoy basic left / right stereo recordings again.   
 I first learned about Time Out while living in London.  The London edition of this magazine became my constant companion, allowing me to find great events.  Now living just outside of NYC, TONY was my first magazine subscription at my new apartment.  Offers many free events, as well as its usual picky reviews.  Great for a one-resource list of the week's events 
 I was so thrilled to find this collection.  As a little girl, I had the books along with the records.  The records were great...especially when Frances would sing...and the background music and sound effects were magical.  When I played this tape, I was disappointed.  There is no music or sound effects...just a woman with an English accent that reads the story to you...and she reads very quickly.  The songs are sung differently than they were on the records but the more and more I listen to this tape, the more I am just happy to have something that reminds me of my childhood.  I am still searching for the original recordings though 
 This is a fundamental book for everyone who is in a committed relationship with Christ and who wants to deepen their communion with Christ on a daily or hourly basis.  It is an essential book for anyone's personal library 
 I had this book on my bookshelf, but didn't read it until the day I found an abandoned kitten in the bushes in front of the house. She had her first road trip the very next weekend. She loves car rides, wears a harness, walks on a leash, comes when she is called...I cannot say enough about this book. I grew up with cats and have always had my own cats, but until I had this book, I had NO idea what I was missing. We have three more cats, all successfully introduced into the family following this book's guidelines. Now we have rescued a colony of feral kittens and using this advice. I'm sorry anyone ever had a bad experience, but from all the cats I've known, this book is invaluable and should be handed out with every adoption!!!!

 Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen.  As an aside, I remain amazed and impressed that Iles can so effectively write a  novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of  sexual abuse.   Not a five star, but a solid four.   
 I have not read the graphic novel so will not get into a debate of format. I can only say that I thought the film was brilliant; a 1984ish parable updated for the ominous times in which we live today. I think people need to be reminded that the fight and sacrifice for freedom is not something that a previous generation did for us, but something we have to do for ourselves day by day. The abdication of that fight, in reality and in the fictional England of "V for Vendetta", will always lead to deprivation and despair; chaos and violence.  Now about the book...  ...Novelizations based upon films are justifiably viewed with skepticism; however, Steve Moore did right by the film and wrote an engrossing novel as well. Fans of the film will be relieved to know that the dialog in the novel is verbatim the same dialog as in the film, with all of those excellent Shakespeare soliloquies coming through intact. It was worth reading the novel just to have those passages near to hand. As some art forms can only be properly portrayed in film, so too, depths of character and backstory can only be properly portrayed in print. The novel provides just a little more exposition than was possible in the film; a little more insight into V and Evey and Finch, et al. Steve Moore's novelization can stand alone as an excellent work of political fiction. 
 First off,I have been a fan of Elvira's since her first movie "Elvira Mistress of the Dark" came out.  I have always admired the spunky character.  I told a guy I was dating once that Elvira was my hero and he replied back to me that she's not even real.  Who cares!  The character Elvira is a role model to me and I really look up to the person behind that character.  She's gorgeous, spunky, has a cheesy and charming sense of humor, and she speaks her mind!  Simply put, she kicks ass!  Now, with that being said, I was really saddened at some of the reviews I've read here.. not only is "Haunted Hills" being cut on, but the lovely Elvira is being cut on for her age, playing the character of Elvira at her age, and the way she looks... ????  WOW!!!  I did watch "Haunted Hills" and I've watched it quite a few times actually.  This movie is a "feel good movie" and I enjoyed it thoroughly!  Elvira has an amazing charm and it shines in "Haunted Hills" as well.  Elvira looks wonderful and I'm not entirely sure of how the comments of how "bad" she looked came about.  I will say that the lighting did seem bad at times in small parts of the movie, but ANYONE, regardless of age, won't look their best in bad lighting.  I've had friends of mine say that they had a bad picture taken of them and said it made them look haggard or terrible and it was because of bad lighting.. etc.  Yes, Elvira looks fantastic compared to some actresses half her age.  Does it sound like I'm trying to fend for Elvira?  Not entirely.  I'm just pointing out some facts and how harsh some of those comments were.    To move on, it's quite possible that some were expecting "Haunted Hills" to be something similar to her first movie, and there lies alot of the disappointment... but who am I to say.  I applaud Elvira for taking it upon herself to see this movie made.  It's the cheesiest humor (which is Elvira all over and it's always worked for her!), fantastic settings, and it's just an all around fun movie!  I won't go on about the scenes and characters since a few have posted already in detail about them.    I'm not an expert on the Elvira news, but it seems she's kind of dropped out of the spotlight since this movie came out.  I think she continues to make public appearances, but other than that, I'm not sure.  Out of my curiosity one day to see what's new with her, I did a little search on the net and found that there are some admirers of hers trying to get her a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame.  This woman deserves one for all the pleasant years she has given laughter, inspiration, shared her talent, and for just being Elvira!  To anyone that did or didn't like this movie.. my words would be simply this:  We see what we want to see.  Everyone's tastes are different and that is just that.  I don't cut on anyone for not liking "Haunted Hills", but I applaud the ones that did.  I will always keep this movie in my collection!   
 One of the best yoga books to assist the beginning instructor on how to adjust and assist the student.  Wording is descriptive and to the point.  Wish there were more poses than 30.  Maybe the author will come out with a second book with 30 more poses.. 
 I read this book after I visited Gloucester last year and had a chance to read F/V Black Sheep before it was published, in it the author talks about drinking in a bar with Sully so it was interesting to be able to get this book and read about what happened to him. Gloucester fishermen sure lead tough lives. This is a very exciting book with lots of details and information about what their lives are like. I'll probably read it again. 
 LCR is a great game.  Fun for all ages!!  And it's so small you can keep it in your purse (especially on vacation) to have handy for play after dinner or while waiting for a seat etc.... 
 This is a collection of lectures given at the LSE.  So DON'T think it is a history.  Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive journey from aristotle's economica thru the modern era.  Good as a reference.  Not bad as a read -- but be aware you are reading a transcribed lecture and adjust your expectations accordingly 
 This cd is so cool and all the songs are thight and of the chain I like that song rica apretadita is cool 
 Few films carry an all Female cast that was so strong in it's acting, and making you believe that what was happening actually unfolds as you watch, of course the making of, just blew me away with how real and cleverly the movie came together. I would have like to have seen an expansion of the characters involvement between the end 2 female characters and a related male character who we see at the start, but only get an inkling as too their possible involvement to possibly each other....you have to be quick... 10/10 all up, and I Highly recommend it.

 For school administrators who need some tips/helpful hints or for those aspiring to become school administrators....  This is a must read!  Although not read like a novel, this written tool gives much needed advice  for handling situations that eduators and administrators must face in  today's world.  This should be in every administrator's office and in every  graduate student's curriculum 
  I thought this movie was very good. I love the Middle Ages time era, and the things that made this movie good was the fact that it had some history in it. Plus, I liked the way they showed that there were certain problems with traveling back and forth through time. And how at a certain point you won't be able to get back home:( Then, too the end of the movie with Maverick and Lady Claire buried in the tomb stone HE was actually digging up himself. It makes you wonder who would've been there in his place if he kept digging 
 I received my Kingston 256MB SD card just as advertised. The unit came in the mail exactly 2 days after I ordered. Worked perfectly and I'm very satisfied 
 I bought this book and went on the diet during my second IVF cycle--after 3 years of trying.  I got pregnant for the first time in my life...Unfortunately, I miscarried at 11 weeks, but this was due to Down's Syndrome & my doctors have told me it was not related to my infertility problems (endometriosis) at all.  What I most took to heart was the author's qualification that though the diet has not been proven by traditional scientific trials, the worst that will happen is that you will eat nutritiously while you're on it.  I don't know if this diet got me pregnant or if it would have happened anyway, but now that I'm embarking on another IVF, I feel strongly enough about the diet that I am going on it again, just in case it was what made things work for me last time. (BTW, I did not follow the diet strictly after becoming pregnant).  I also just ate the yams I found in the supermarket.  Maybe it's one of those mind over matter things.  It is an effort, but I just feel like it's worth a try.  Who knows?  Best of luck to all out there TTC 
 Whining, 30's something, music obsessed, English guy can't get it together.  He searches in all the wrong places to blame everything in his life on someone else.  His character is so well written, he becomes annoying and there is a real need to hang in there with him to find out if he ever figures himself out.  Self centered, going nowhere, taking advantage of others seems to be his lot in life. Interesting presentation of how some men view the world, waste their lives, and those who are drawn to them. 
    This Is Some Straight Killa. In My Opinion, there is no other three six mafia album that beats harder. I would Prefer you to get this album 
 S. Robert Ramsey's THE LANGUAGES OF CHINA is a survey originally published by Princeton University Press in 1987. China is an immense country with a rich linguistic heritage, and it is a challenge to cover even the basics adequately in a mere 340 pages. Ramsey does an admirable job, and this student of historical linguistics was thrilled to see such attention paid to the diachrony of many languages mentioned within.  The "Chinese language", the set of mutually unintelligible dialects belonging to Han people and descended from a relatively recent common ancestor, is by far the most widely-spoken in China, and Ramsey dedicates the first half of the book to it. He begins with a presentation of the historical debate over Han linguistic unification, with the northern dialects winning out over southern dialects like those of Shanghai and Guangdong. Since Mandarin has, for better or worse, been taken as the standard, it is the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Mandarin that Ramsey describes as representative of the entire language. Ramsey clearly wrote for a non-specialist audience, as he tries to debunk older Western myths that Chinese is somehow a "primitive" language due to its lack of inflection. The grammar of Mandarin here is splendidly full for just a few pages, though the debate over the use of the particle "le" isn't mentioned.   Ramsey's coverage of Chinese isn't, however, purely synchronic, for  he also devotes space to the earlier stages of the language. He begins with an explanation of the Qieyun rhyming dictionary, the document compiled by Lu Fayan that, in spite of its faults, is our only useful source for the pronunciation of Middle Chinese. Ramsey then gives a colourful presentation of the life and work of Berhard Karlgren, the Swedish scholar who, by applying the comparative method to modern Chinese dialects, worked towards a phonetic reality for the mere algebraic relationships of the Qieyun dictionary. But this is not mere blind adulation, Ramsey does acknowledge Karlgren's faults and lists the younger scholars who followed him and improved on his theories. Ramsey also briefly mentions Old Chinese, the reconstruction of which is quite uncertain, and talks about some of the important changes from Middle Chinese to modern Mandarin.  The second half of the book deals with the many non-Han languages of China. First is the "Altaic family" spoken in the north of China, the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages that may or may not be a valid genetic grouping, but which have significant typological similarities. Here again Ramsey gives abundant space to diachronic issues, showing how various modern languages each differ from their common ancestor. Writing systems, too, are covered. The languages of the south come next, including the Tai, Tibeto-Burman, Miao-Yao, and Mon-Khmer families, as well as unclassified or isolated languages. The story of how these languages have fared under Han domination is a major theme of the book.  If you have little bit of Mandarin under your belt (and you don't need a lot) and are interested in the linguistic diversity of this part of the world, THE LANGUAGES OF CHINESE is worth seeking out. This is especially true for historical linguistics curious about China. I can only wonder why it hasn't been reissued 
 When I first opened this book, I had already read numerous books on Technical Analysis, including candlesticks, momentum oscillators, volume indicators and basic chart patterns.  It became obvious to me that the Elliott Wave Principle lies at the heart of why certain chart patterns work only a certain percentage of the time; for what one is seeing in chart patterns is the formation of robust fractals, or Elliott Waves.  Chart patterns are the blunt tool and Elliott Waves, the knife - at least in a probabalistic sense, as no method provides perfect accuracy.        This book is not for the mentally lazy, which included me when I first started reading it.  In fact, it took me several months just to get through it, understand it and then apply it in real time chart reading.  I still keep going back to it as a reference.  However, if you have an obsessive desire to understand the financial markets, you will make it through the book and be rewarded with a perspective that VERY few have on the financial markets and, therefore, the psychology of crowds.     I would suggest The Wave Principle of Human Social Behaviour (also by Prechter) before reading the highly technical Elliott Wave Principle.  Your want to learn the details of the Elliott Wave Principle will then be fully primed.    
 We have really enjoyed our liddle griddle.  Its convenient to cook anything.  It's especially good for breakfast - pancakes, bacon & eggs.  But we have also ended up cooking hamburgers or porkchops on it when the gas grill has run out of fuel.  The size makes it easy to clean and store. We are ordering our third griddle shortly - we use them so much that the surface wears out.  Now, don't get me wrong - our first griddle lasted about 5 years, the last one about 2 years.  Again, we use it all the time.  It really is one of the best purchases for our kitchen we have ever made.  
 I am taking a class on Harlem renaissance literature and this was the first book assigned. It is easy to read and an enlightening story, the background information provided was interesting as well 
 May not look like much with such few words on each page but this GEM OF A BOOK, filled with engaging illustrations, provides an ideal and a totally fun storytime.  Use as a warm-up. A denouement   prepares young listeners to further enjoy stories about sheep. Follow with Nancy Shaw's Sheep in a Jeep !! 
 This book is simply one of the best dictionaries of its kind ever to have been published, and, I might add, Brewer's work has already become a classic. It contains a wealth of entries from divers areas, including  mythology, history, classics, language, as well as common sayings, phrases  and legends. Useful as a reference though it is, this dictionary is  eminently suited to a casual browse, which one will invariably find  interesting, entertaining and edifying, containing many obscure tidbits of  trivia that catches one's eyes. This edition, unfortunately, omits a few  entries that were present in previous editions, and this is a sad loss,  but, all in all, the book is worth every penny, and is a valuable reference  on anyone's bookshelf, especially to those with literary pretensions 
 I just got done writing a fairly long review, so I'll be brief with this one. I highly recommend this book, as I recommend all of P.D. James' books. If you want an author who keeps things fresh and entertaining, then you will definitely enjoy this book. Maybe this isn't James' strongest book, but that doesn't matter. She's a master, and she deserves well above four stars. For these people below me to knock it down makes me wonder if they really know what a dearth of great authors are out there. But I can see their point, since James has set the bar so high with all her books before this one 
 this is a mad hot cd. the only reason i didnt give it a 5 is cuz the second half of the cd can get boring. i recommend this to any fan of west coast hip hop, or any fan of hip hop at al 
 This was the most informative book I have read about the Canadian Mafia. Very interesting reading about the rise of Montreal Mafia 
 I too HIGHLY recommend Iza Trapani's "I'm a Little Teapot" and "The Itsy Bitsy Spider"! This book is so beautifully illustrated, and brings the classic song to life. This was a great bedtime book and now my kids are starting to read it themselves! Timeless!  
 I absolutely love this novel! OK, it's no "Pride and Prejudice" or "Gone With the Wind", but I'm still not understanding all the negative reviews. I like True, she seems like a good-hearted person, Hank was SUPPOSED to be a semi-jerk, and Franny, Rudy, and Esa were all cute characters. Give this book a chance 
 I received this book from a dear friend a few months after the birth of my daughter, and found it to be the best gift I had ever gotten!  The voices of these women, with experiences like mine but far greater ability to put  them on paper, were extraordinarily reassuring during the often-difficult  transition to motherhood.  I now give this to every new mom, and it's  always greatly appreciated 
 Just want to say that it is a great book that Carolyn Corbin has written.  I borrowed it from the Singapore National Library 
 I have been very happy with this mattress.  After researching Baby Bargains, Consumer Reports and reading all the online reviews I decided on this one.  Good quality but best of all a perfect fit for the delta luv jenny lind crib.  Mattress is firm and has the recommended coil number.  Do your homework and you will find yourself coming back to this mattress.    
 George is so versatile.  I like all his music--even the stuff that didn't get played on the radio a lot.  "Something" is definitely my favorite Harrison tune.  My teenage daughter has discovered this CD and LOVES "Give me Love" and "What is Life".  I can hardly keep this in my car, she keeps borrowing it. Guess it's time to buy another one so we can both listen 
 All the Absolute books have been perfect so far, and I will certainly order the next three volumes of Absolute Sandman. Well worth the money, and the centerpiece of any bookcase. Actually, I would have paid more as well done as it is 
 In Kaalbringen, a quaint seaside town in Sweden, the population lives in fear. Two men have been killed by an ax murderer. One is an ex-con while the other is a wealthy businessman. The relentless detective Chief Inspector Van Veeteren is assigned to the case. The stakes get higher when another body is found. Can Van Veeteren and the local police solve the crimes before more lives are lost? Hakan Nesser is a well known crime fiction writer in Europe. He has written a series of bestselling novels starring Inspector Van Veeteren. BORKMANN'S POINT is the first to be translated into English. The major strength of this work is the character of Van Veeteren. He is a likable detective, highly competent at what he does. The minor characters are also solid creations. This mystery is so character-driven that despite of the somewhat simple solution, the book as a whole works remarkably well. The setting of the seaside village is also described with great care. BORKMANN'S POINT won the best novel award for the Swedish Crime Writers' Academy in 1994. It is easy to see why.   
  I started to watch Eternal "Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", and after first 15 minutes I realized I could not turn it off and drive to work (which I was supposed to do). I did what Jim Kerry's character Joel did - I called my boss and left her a message that I would be late. I stayed home and I watched the film. I cried, I laughed, I sighed, I felt - I lived through it. There are not so many films that we don't just watch but live through - for me, ESotSM was that. Finally, the Charlie Kaufman's film that I absolutely love. "Being John Malkovich" amused me; "Adaptation" irritated me - too much of Charlie in there for my taste even if he looked like Nic Cage. "Eternal Sunshine..." is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us - to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works?   I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played their best roles ever and I hope to see Carrey more often in the dramatic performances. But in the beginning of everything there was a word - without Kaufman's screenplay the film would not have happened. Thank you, Charlie.   
 This was an excellent story with extremely well developed characters.  Although, I have never before been close to experiencing what the characters of this book were challenged with, I was able to identify with all of the characters.  The plots and twists are engaging and it is obvious how much time and research the author put into entertaining his reader!  Thanks Jeffrey 
 this cd is a great cd for bumpin you thang in the whip.  you got a good system this what you need.  great beat and great flow he keeps it real 
 This book in my opinion is a very effective tool for the professional salesperson of today. The ideas in the book, when followed are a sure fire way to succeed in the ever changing highly competitive sales industry of  today. Anyone interested in advancing their career or the career of other  fellow sales professionals will see this book needs to be in their library  for personal growth. I have and will continue to spread this book around in  my circle of influence, to further the career's of my peer's 
 Songs like Nik Kershaw's "Wouldn't it Be Good" and The Special AKA's "Nelson Mandela" make this easily the best volume in this 15 volume series.  Nik Kershaw fans beware:  An edited version of  "Wouldn't it Be Good" appears here 
 This is a good summary of the history of Japan. It spans all topics and is quite balanced in social, political and economic issues. McClain's book takes quite an academic approach to Japan's history, (without exessive notes of course). It is well founded, he is precise, concise and avoids controversal or journalistic subjects and speculation (such as whether Roosevelt knew about the attac on pearl harbor). In this sense this book can be highly recommended for those readers who look for a no-nonsense textbook. However, this style makes the read a bit boring. Compared to other historical books I have read I found it hard to read and - as a non-english native speaker - it took me a long time. Because the writer never goes deep into one subject, the reader gets only a kind of the summary of an issue. The book is never really gripping and as a more casual reader it is probably not my the first choice. John Dower and David Nathan have left me more inspired.            
 I really enjoyed the first few books of the Left Behind series, but as the preachiness increased and the quality of the story and writing began to sank, I just couldn't bear continuing to the very end.  But as a stand alone book, it's easy to see why this one was such a bestseller and went on to spawn several more in a series. The characters feel alive and so real; so very human as though their very lives were being recorded down, not invented.  The premise, that of everyone dissapearing in a worldwide rapture, may not be agreed upon by all Christians or biblical scholars but as a plot point in fiction, it works wonders. Just imagine that billions of people dissapear from the earth - would you want to know what happens? What consequences it has on the world in the days, weeks, and months after the event? I know that curiosity is certainly what got me to pick this one up, and it definately delivers.  I also recommend reading the sequal and the third book too, because by then I'm sure you'll have made your mind up on whether 'Left Behind' is "your thing" or not 
 This is a loving and warm story of a Mississippi family during the depression.  As a Mississippian, I have never read a book that so clearly gives the reader the sense of being in the Mississippi farm culture during this time.  The characters are based on Deal's real life experiences and each of them is a living, breathing person you will come to care deeply about.   I hope you take the time to read i 
 Crawford fans already know that while this movie was a famous flop for Joan, it contains one of her most interesting performances. Now they can see it struck from a near-immaculate print and enjoy both the gorgeous cinematography and those wild closeups of Joan. A friend of mine who is not a Crawford fan described her look in this movie as "Makeup Poisoning". Personally, I love Joan's characterization of South Seas prostitute Sadie Thompson. Highly stylized, it's a little ridiuclous, but  compelling. In her "redeemed" scenes  Sadie is quite moving (and stunningly beautiful! This was Crawford at her peak). Sadie's ascent up the staircase to confront Walter Houston's lustful preacher is brilliantly handled and has to be one of Joan's best confrontation scenes ever --ranking  right up there with Mildred slapping Veda. A little talky and slow in spots, but the rewards are worth the wait 
 This was the assigned book in my first year grad topology course. It has good examples, interesting exercises. I like the emphasis on geometrical examples, constructions. It's not easy to read, but interesting 
 If you have a spirited child this book is a must read!  The best part of this book is that she helps you figure out what specific situations trigger your child and the best ways to deal with (and avoid) those situations.   She doesn't lump all spirited child together.  I bought two parenting books  when I purchased this one and I didn't even bother reading the second one.   Awesome book - it saved my sanity and perhaps one spirited little 4 1/2  year old 
 Delivered on time in perfect shape.  So far, works as it is designed.  Great picture with the direct dish.  Would recommend to anyone 
 Being a teacher of English, I recommend this book because it's a must-have item, one can learn better about fruit and vegetables by looking at them. It can used by students of all age 
 I have always had a fascination regarding J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.  This book, Public Enemies" gave me a chance to learn more about this era of our history.  It was packed with so much information that it is one audio book that I will listen to again and again in order to take in all the facts, names and timeframe described in it.  In 1933, there was no FBI so how did this group get its start, and when it was formed, it was not a well oiled group.  They did not have guns and when they finally were allowed to, they had to be taught how to use them.  They were sloppy on surveillance and allowed the criminals to escape more than once before getting up to speed.  What do you know of the gangsters of this era such as John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd and the Barker gang?  Did you know Ma Barker was never really a part of the gang?  Did you know that Bonnie was badly burned?  Where did the term G-Man come from?  What were the FBI's original duties and who was really responsible for all the captures?  This audio book reveals all this and more.    Public Enemies describes a less than glamorous life that each of these groups led most of the time.  Of course, when they were flush with stolen money, life was good but as the FBI became a better working group, they caused them to run from the law and live hand-to-mouth.  The audio book also tells about who was willing to harbor them and what their favorite haunts were.  Campbell Scott was the reader and he read well.  He did not have a lot of voice changes to denote one person from another so I had to pay close attention to what was being read so I knew who was speaking.  The introduction by author, Bryan Burrough, set up what the whole book would tell and he wrote well enough to keep me from wanting to stop the tape.  If 1933 and the gangster era holds a fascination for you, grab a copy 
 Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy 
 This book is what one expects, a comprehensive coverage of HTML/XHTML.  There are perhaps more easily digested books on the subject, but this is well structured and readily understood reference work.  It is my primary source of  accurate HTML information.  
 I originally purchased this book for my Father who was a young Marine in Korea. Once I received it though I found it to be a very interesting read. When I was in high school 20 years ago, we learned very little about the Vietnam War in our history classes. By reading this novel by Christy Sauro I was able to learn not only technical facts about Vietnam but I could also feel the emotions that he and the other Marines and their families went through during the war. For this being Mr. Sauro's first novel I thought he did an excellent job and also did his research well 
 I've had a copy of this book for at least 25 years and read it over and over. It is by a Brit, but so what? Make the stretch. It covers so many aspects of the subject that transcend goats that it would be informative to anyone interested in land management and animal husbandry in general. He deals with concepts of nutrition ecology and health hardly ever dealt with today, such as alternatives to the use of mainstream comercial feeds, rearing methods and things too numerous to mention, and all from a unique perspective. A true lover of goats. It's THE Bible of goats, written back in 1957 and never equaled to my  knowledge 
 This book is the one I finally bought for myself out of all the current books on the subject.  It successfully walks a fine line between being too overly "popular" in nature to be useful and too achademicly  oriented to be readable. At 400 pages it is not a casual read. Be ready for  occasionally dense and often contrary insights from most of the "big  thinkers" in the field. Perhaps not the first book you should buy on  this subject but a highly recomended next step for any person desiring to  extend their knowledge beyond the level of what is in the generally  recomended popular books on this still mysterious subject 
 Compared to Wolf and Mandel's tome "Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics", this book gives the reader a lighter job on math without him reading over 100 pages on probability theory and fourier transform. However, this book has two major drawbacks:  1. The author keeps refering to later chapters on some important concept. When I read the first two chapters, I have many undefined concept and unanswered questions, whose answer may be put in chapter 16! For those who are already familiar with this field, it may not be a problem. But a rookie may want a lucid and detailed introduction in the beginning.  2. Some calculation should be elaborated because the result is far from obvious 
 Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Business Protocol continues to be an invaluable compendium of "user friendly" information for entrepreneurs and business managers in the protocols of the workplace. The corporate manager will receive gift-giving guidelines; communication (email, fax, cell phones, beepers, voice mail) etiquette standards; business meal and entertaining guidelines; the do's and don'ts of office friendships and romances; ethical conduct standards, holiday officer party norms; and much, much more. Business Protocol is "must" reading for anyone wanting to master those social skills that can help make their career or company successful in today's highly competitive marketplace 
 Yes, it's hard to get a copy, but hunt one down because once you've heard the original vinyl this music will reveal more to you than you ever thought possible - it wasn't cut for CD, it wasn't mastered for CD, it was made back in the days of vinyl, upon which it sounds warm, deep and extremely rich like a great French crepe - these 1970s CD issues always sound thin, reedy, shrill, boxy and lacking ambience and depth; as for the bass tones, well, where are they?  All the instruments are seperated out instead of blending together, then the vocals are left to hang on the top right out front someplace.  This is not how it's meant to sound, and not how the LP is mixed.  Repertoire does us all a favour by keeping this stuff available and leading new listeners to it, but that doesn't alter the fact that these compressed digital approximations are NOT what is to be found on the vinyl pressings; half the time these CDs are like listening to some second generation tape recording a mate's made for you to introduce you to something new.  The same problem exists for the other greats of this era; the two Cressida LPs, Caravan's charming In the Land of the Grey and Pink; Focus' Moving Waves: they just do not sound very good on CD.  Treat yourselves to some decent hi fi, seek out the vinyl originals, and find out what you've been missing.  This Spring album is highly original, and almost borders on the perfect prog era record, it just falls a little short in a few places.  But the sound is amazing, most of the songs, in particular the last cut, are superb, and Pat Moran's vocals blend into the music far better on the vinyl - they're an acquired taste perhaps, but if you listen to jazz singers and less mainstream belters your ears will adjust, he has great phrasing, a really passionate delivery, and a charming lisp which he works to his advantage. After you're familiar with this mighty fine work, can you really imagine anyone else singing these songs better?  Find yourself a vinly copy and hear how great this recording really is. 
 Dr. Colgan writes a complete and thorough book which describes the process to develop an athletic and useful body.  I've followed him faithfully for the last 15 months with remarkable results.  I'm a 53 year old man who was unfit.  Cogan has changed my life.  It's that simple.    The best advise among much is his common sense approach to preparation in the gym.  If you follow his advise to build the connective tissue and stablizing muscles you will reduce the chance of injury.  THAT will save you a trip to the Chiropractor or Orthopedic Surgeon!  I did a chin-up for the first time in 30 years a few weeks ago after 15 months of training!  That might sound strange.  If you're a couch potato then I challenge you to get down on the floor and do 20 push-ups.  Better yet, find a bar or beam and pull yourself up.  You can't do it, most men can't!  Get the book, follow, and change your life before it's too late!  Added 03/05: This program is very intense.  If you're an athlete then this program is great.    For people who have not exercised for years, you need to go VERY slowly or you'll injure a joint or two.  Watch your elbows for pain.  It is intense on the elbows, especially the Power portion.    For seniors I would not recommend lifting any weight you can't handle for at least 5 repetitions.  During the Power phase you lift your maximum weight, which is frankly dangerous for most.  Arnold Swazeneger had a heart attack and his doctors told him NOT to lift the Max weights.  Go lower weight higher reps.  Much of the program involves 4 days a week.  You're arms take a beating by doing resistance training 2 days in a row.  For example, one series involves "Shoulders" on Monday followed by "Arms" on Tuesday.  Shoulders involve the arms secondarily, then turn around and do arms on Tuesday.  You risk an elbow injury.  It's a good challenging program, but listen to your body.  If you're sore than don't lift weights with that muscle.  Colgan doesn't give enough information for most people to judge this. 
 J.D. Robbs is a new author for me though I am familiar with both this pseudonym and her real author's name of Nora Roberts. In general I tend to stay away from mysteries that use rough language, and mysteries dependent upon sexual predators, and though there was both of these topics or tendencies in this book, I could barely put it down. It was extremely engrossing, and I find that many of my own opinions concerning those who were abused as children were mirrored by Robb/Roberts. Many people have existed through the history of the world who overcame horrendous abuse, and used their lives for good, so I have no pity for those who 'choose' (yes, 'choose') to become evil to fulfill some need in side of them to punish the person who hurt them in the first place.  Robb's characterization is not three dimensional in this book. You get a sense of Eve's, Roarke's, and their friends voice and mannerisms, but I found it hard to bring up a picture of the people themselves in these books. Maybe in some of the other ones that I intend to read.  With the latest natural disasters of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we saw newspaper articles released along with photographs of a 4000 pound alligator who had been shot in the streets of New Orleans, as he feasted on the dead and unwary. I have always loved animals, even most predators like the big cats, but there were a few animals that I would gladly rid the world of because they are nothing but lean, mean, eating machines. Alligators and Sharks are some of them. I told my husband they should give the military freedom to shoot every alligator in sight down there...I would not care. Another predator would take it's place in the environment. To a good extent I feel the same way about rapists, child molestors, and serial murderers. The loss of any form of responsibility, compassion for others, and no purpose to life but to rid themselves of that person (or ones like him or her( who impacted their lives so horribly) leaves society with little choice but to lock these killing machines away and throw away the key (especially since the liberals refuse to allow the death penalty to be practiced. Better these guys, then the innocent who just happened to be seen through their crosshairs!  Karen sadle 
 I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did. Read this book 
 This collection of essays and papers by experts in the area of early Christian/middle Jewish history will be of interest to most students of the fascinating period during which there was a "parting of the ways" between the earliest Christians, many of whom were Jewish, and the descendants of Pharisaic Judaism in the post-Temple period (starting in AD 70) through the second rebellion of Bar Kochba in AD 135.  The papers deal with and analyze material from early Christianity including sacred writings (contrasting harsher polemical material in Matthew with more resigned, mature reflections in John, in turn compared with Pauline conclusions), Patristic apologetic material (including Clementine literature, Barnabas and Justin Martyr), Talmudic allusions to "minim" (heretics) and reactions to difficulties with what constituted proper synagogue worship, and other early Christian and Jewish sources (including Jewish pseudepigraphical writings).  The papers are of varying tenor, a few appear to be losely tied in with the "parting of the ways" theme, but overall the editor has chosen well and the collection will be of interest to the student of the period 
 An excellent book. One of the best I have read on the subject.  Very well written, easy to understand.  Good suggestions for parents and teachers.   Every teacher should read this book!  Every parent should read this book!   Every school trustee should read this book!   It should be a book studied  in a compulsory course at teachers college since we get unidentified  learning disabled students in our classes and we are really not prepared.    Dyslexia is an invisible handicap and unfortunately few teachers are  qualified to recognise this LD. Your site is very useful because I am the  founder and the president of a non profit  association for french parents  of children with dyslexia and I am always looking for information on  dyslexia (high school teacher since 1974) Our daughter has dyslexia. She  was tested by 8 different specialists and none mentioned dyslexia.  They  all said she was gifted, she would grow out of  it, she was lazy... this  ruined her self-esteeme.  Was finally diagnosed at 13.  Did multi-sensory  method with her. Now she is doing great 
 Contrary to what one might think, this book does NOT make the argument for "leaving it up to the experts". Quite the contrary, it ecourages science educators to stop teaching science "because" people "need" to know basic scientific principles (it may be difficult to accept this, but Shamos gives loads of evidence of why it is an empty goal). The book does by no means discourage the teaching of science. It argues for a CHANGE in the way science is thaught, and in the reasons behind the way science is thaught. Its main argument is that science must be taught because of its aesthetic value, because that's the most realistic way to get good, effective and, above all, honest, science teaching 
 I'm reading this book now for the second time. Charles Marowitz has an interesting style of writing, the kind that you have to stop and think about it for a little while every other page or so. I often go back and re-read some sentences just to make sure I fully understood the whole meaning and the context. It's a very professional view on theatre in all it's aspects. It's not usual to find an author that does not mind sharing his point of view and breaking taboos (I like the way he disagrees with Method acting in some aspects ). This book has helped me in my work as an actor and director 
 This toy is very small, please check sizes when ordering....I should have known better than to assume the washer was bigger, but learned a lesson.. 
 Somehow "The Liveship Traders" just got better.  Robin Hobb, the author of the "Farseer" trilogy and "Ship of Magic", has written a book that builds upon the story began in "Ship of Magic" and expands it far enough that already I have to consider "The Liveship Traders" be superior to the excellent "Farseer" trilogy.  How did she do this?  Robin Hobb simply turned the entire world of the Traders and Bingtown on its head.    When we last left our characters at the end of "Ship of Magic" we saw Kyle Havan, his son Wintrow, and the Liveship Vivacia taken captive by the pirate Captain Kennit.  Kennit had been striving to capture a Liveship so that he could rid the waters of slave traders (Havan, on his first voyage on Vivacia after his father in law Trader Vestrit died, is trading in slaves).  A Liveship is a sentient ship and one that is bound to her owners family, but if tamed would be the best ship on the water.  Althea, the daughter of Trader Vestrit, is sailing back to Bingtown on another Liveship after having quite a hard time proving that she could be a sailor.  She had expected to inherit Vivacia from her father and her brother in law, Kyle Havan, told her that the only way she would ever get the ship was to prove herself a sailor.  Brashen Trell, the former first mate of the Vivacia and disinherited son of a Trader family, is sailing on a pirate ship himself as it is the only berth he could get.  The Vestrit family is low on fortune and struggling to make the payments for the Vivacia and is counting on the money Kyle would bring back from the slave trade.  Except that he hasn't returned yet.    This previous paragraph helps to bring the storyline up to the beginning of "Mad Ships", although it is a much abbreviated version of what happened in "Ship of Destiny" and robs the story of all of its craft and does not do justice to it.  "Mad Ship" takes everything further and in a whole new direction.  Brashen Trell returns to Bingtown with news that the Vivacia is captured.  Althea also returns and learns of this and helps her family, with the assistance of Brashen and a mysterious woman named Amber to rescue the Vivacia.  This is one third of the story.  The next third of the story revolves around the Vestrit family, in particular the youngest daughter Malta.  Malta is being courted by a young man named Reyn from the Rain Wilds Trader family who holds the lease of the Vivacia.  Malta starts the novel wanting nothing more than to live a lavish lifestyle and to be introduced into society and feels held back by her family's impending poverty.  But as the novel progresses Malta begins to learn what it is to rely on her family and her responsibility.  She still has flights of fancy, but not to the extent as before and she becomes much more responsible.  The final third of "Mad Ship" deals with Captain Kennit and Wintrow.  Wintrow is the eldest (living) son of Kyle Havan and Keffira Vestrit and was studying to be a priest of Sa.  But when Kyle's heir died he was called back unwilling to resume his place in the family and by the time of this novel Kyle took his own son a slave, branded his face, and was disgusted by Wintrow.  But Wintrow is the only one with Vestrit blood aboard the Vivacia and this bond is vitally important...except that Wintrow's rejection of this life has caused the Vivacia to be able to be wooed by Captain Kennit into piracy.  It is interesting that the character of Captain Kennit initially appeared to be one of the villains of the story is coming out a hero in "Mad Ship".  Whether or not this holds is another question, but he is feeling like an anti-hero as he wants to improve the lives of those in the Pirate Isles and end slavery...but he is a pirate himself with all that entails.    To reveal too much of where "Mad Ship" takes the story would lessen the joy in discovering it.  The pace of the story still moves at a gradual but insistent pace, but the story is rich in detail and Hobb builds this world with great skill.  Even though it is part of the same world of the "Farseer" trilogy, "The Liveship Traders" takes place in a completely different part of the world and while the Six Duchies are referred to as is the Red Ships War it is only a reference to set this story on a chronology.  Suffice it to say that what Robin Hobb reveals about the nature of Liveships and also about the serpents which keep getting a prologue and a few "interlude" chapters changes everything about how I view the story.  Not to mention that Hobb has completely altered the lives of Bingtown and the characters irrevocably.    Midway through this novel I was very much wrapped up in the story Robin Hobb was telling and by the end I was in turn impressed, wanting to cheer (Althea), and shocked by the revelations.  I knew Hobb was a good writer and have enjoyed the four previous books of hers I have read, but "Mad Ship" is a cut above those.  I am truly excited to finish of the trilogy with "Ship of Magic" and as I said in the first paragraph I believe this series to be better than her excellent "Farseer" trilogy.    -Joe Sherr 
 Rock Steady is a great party album. No Doubt just let their hair down and did the damn thing. No, the music isn't ska, but it still has elements of island, reggae flavor mixed with rock. Their previous album Return of Saturn didn't really grab most people's attention despite being the best album of their career. I still marvel at how much I enjoy Return of Saturn, but I digress. Rock Steady comes one year later, and was met to better fanfare partly because the public was warmed over due to Gwen's solo appearances with Eve and Moby. Also, the music is simpler and catchier, which seems to be what the masses want.   Most of the songs are really good. There are no Don't Speaks, but the album is very consistent.  Hella Good-this song was written by the Neptunes and I suspect they produced it even though the song is credited to being produced by Nellee Hooper. You can hear the Neptunes sound in it regardless.  Hey Baby-it took me forever to like this song. It was released as their first single, and I remember hearing it and going, "nope, I'm not buying the album." Obviously, I changed my mind.  Making Out-has a weird sound but is pretty good. Think of a discoish, electronic, computer game like 80s sound.  Underneath It All-a good song with Lady Saw as a featurette. One of the reggae songs.  Detective-a cute song about a girl catching her guy cheating. "Hey girl save the liar. Can't you see his pants on fire?"  Don't Let Me Down-the worst song on the album.   Start The Fire-another reggae song. It's competent, but I hardly listen to it.   Running-a sentimental song about trying to keep a relationship on track.  In My Head-one of my favorites. It's about a paranoid woman who can't trust her boyfriend. I love it when she chants "...cause everybody wants everybody else! Everybody wants everybody else! Only in my head."  Platinum Blonde Life-I didn't like it initially but it has grown on me. I love the music and the lyrics.  Waiting Room-most seem to really hate this song, but I love it. It's weird sounding, but Prince produced it and is featured in it. I love Prince and No Doubt. If they make a cool song together, it's musical bliss.  Rock Steady-a great song that probably should have been released as a single instead of Running. 
 THis book was obviously written by a great Freudian analyst.  It is very thought-provoking, and worth the read, especially if you are in analysis or some form of talk-therapy. Frattaroli makes several important points about the importance of talk therapy, and giving up some of the medications to get the work done - no matter how difficult the journey 
 This finely crafted treasure, edited by Rabbi Nechemia Coopersmith and Rabbi Shraga Simmons portrays life in Israel today , and the trials and tribulations faced by Israel and it's people. It shows you what a prejudiced media will not dare to let you see, because their agenda is to prepare the world for genocide of the Jews of Israel, through a monstrous propaganda machine, never seen since Goebbels and Der Sterner paved the way for the holocaust.  The book is dedicated to the victims of Arab terror , and the first of four sections is a harrowing and heartwrenching portrait of the horrific terror faced by the people of Israel, since Yasser Arafat launched a war of genocide against the Israeli people In this he has been fully backed , in his evil plans , by the international media, world academia,the international left, the United Nations and other powerful global interests.  This part of this phenomenal work shows you that victims of terror are real, that the suffering of the people of Israel is real, no less so because they are ignored by the media and universities.  It deals with the trauma of the familes of those who where murdered by Arab terror , and the pain and courage of those who survived. As we read throught the case histories of some of the +- 1000 Jews killed and tens of thousands injured in the last five years of terror, we are astounded by how resilient are the people of Israel in the face of this onslaught , as well as how cold-blooded and savage her loathsome enemies are:  "All I see in my mind's eye is a woman shrieking as she turns to see her two-year old daughter , in her stroller , engulfed in flames. She reaches to pull her daughter out of the fire-but can't because the explosion that has sheathed the carriage in flames has blown off her own arm below the elbow. She can't pull her daughter out of the burning carriage because she no longer has two hands."   A few of the cases covered: Thousands of Israeli Jewish men, women and children have died from bombs, bullets or knife attacks, and thousands of others have been maimed, blinded, orphaned, widowed and terrorized.   Two years ago on the eve of the Jewish New Year, seven month old Shaked Abraham was shot dead in her crib by an Arab murderer who forced his way into her parent's house as the family was celebrating the New Year.   A ten-month-old Jewish baby, Shalhevet Pass, was shot in her father's arms by an Arab sniper in 2001.   The following year, a five-year-old girl, Danielle Shefi, was shot to death at point blank range by an Arab killer, while cowering under her parents' bed.   That same year, two boys, four- and five-years old, where shot dead together with their mother as she read them a bedtime story, in a left-wing kibbutz, by Arab terrorists.   Over 25% percent of Jewish children living in Israel do not have enough food to eat as a result of the Intifada (war of extermination) waged by Yasser Arafat, along with the economic boycotts initiated by sympathizers of the Palestinian plans of genocide against the Israeli people.    Parts two and three 'Israel Perspectives' and 'Israel Diaries' cover the lives and perspectives of the people living in the Land of Israel, and of the Jewish people generally. Professor Laurie Zoloth details her experiences of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hate at San Fransisco State University. The fourth section involves seperating the facts from the myths , which have been so obscured by the media and universities. Articles by William J Bennett , Benjamin Netanyahu , and Ephraim Karsh detail the facts behind the conflict and the history of terrorism. There is a super article by Rabbi Ken Spiro about the history of Jerusalem ,and the conflicting Jewish and Moslem claims to Jerusalem , and the fifth deals with the choice faced by Jews in the diaspora to return to Israel, the ancient Jewish homeland-to make 'Aliyah'. There is a helpful chapter detaling 55 ways to help Israel. In summing up, Rabbi Shalom Schwartz reminds us that 'Since Camp David, 2000 , it has become painfully obvious that this conflict is not primarily about land , it is about Jews. The book deals a lot with the spiritual side to the conflict , urging Jews to improve themselves spiritually .It is primarily about Love of the three most important things to the Jewish people. Love for the Land of Israel Love for the People of Israel And love for the Torah of Israel. The book affirms the extraordinary spirit of the people of Israel, the most humane, giving, life-affirming people on the planet-- whatever sick propaganda you might have read to the contrary. The past four years have been largely fashioned by the violent and cruel stepping-up of the campaign of those Arabs that call themselves `Palestinians', and their international networks of support, to destroy the Jewish homeland. This attack on Israel is not merely for a piece of land. It is an attack on decency, truth, compassion, respect for human life, on the sense of honor and on the Judeo-Christian spirit.  For the Jews, the past four years have been deluged with antisemitic filth, which has poured from Arab and pro-Arab faucets. These sources include the extreme Left, the international media, Neo-Nazis, the United Nations, much of the European Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, Third World regimes, universities and academics and have been perhaps the bitterest since the fall of the Third Reich. The Palestinian terror network has engaged in merciless slaughter of Jewish men, women and children through bomb and bullet. Their malevolence extends to all continents, and Jews are being attacked on all continents.  Universities around the world have become cauldrons of the most uncompromising hatred of Israel and the Jewish people, with the feverish participation of some radical pro-Palestinian Jews. The media around the world does its best to paint the beleaguered nation of Israel as an aggressor and human rights abuser. They use the most sophisticated as well as the most blunt propaganda tricks, while showing not the slightest compassion or sympathy for the five million Jews of Israel who are facing a wave of daily terror. The Non Aligned Movement, has been particularly venomous in their uncompromising hatred of Israel. They support the most horrific excesses carried out by the Palestinian terror network and by every dictatorship in the world.  In the face of this growing terror, it may seem to be whistling in the wind to call for confidence. Yet it is good to remember the Jews are not fighting alone. Many Christians in the lands where freedom is still valued realize the assault on Israel is an assault on Judeo-Christian civilization, and that the Islamists and their extreme Left allies are a common enemy.  It is good to remember also that the Jews have shown a capacity for resistance and survival that has never been equaled. There have been others who have attempted what the Palestinians and their sympathizers are attempting, such as Pharaoh, Amalek, Haman, Antiochus, Torquemada, Chmielnicki, Hitler and Stalin.  It may require a miracle for Israel to survive the contemporary Amalek, the most powerful incarnation of them all. But the very existence of the Jewish people after so long a travail is itself a miracle. It is clear that God has always pulled the Jewish people through and ensured the total defeat of our enemies.   Jews and Israel must once again call up their reserves of courage and hope and, in alliance with the pro-freedom forces that still survive, continue to fight back. Perhaps our stamina, tested so often in the past, will once again help us over this grave crisis. Most importantly God will once again destroy our enemies and save Am Yisrael 
 Drawing on their extensive work to produce the documentary "If Japan Can, Why Can't We?," the authors provide excellent examples of successes from quality focused organizations across the spectrum, including education and government.  A good read for skeptics.  A good motivator for those working through challenges 
 A number of things passed through my mind while viewing "The Killer".  Firstly, director John Woo, with the possible exception of "Face/Off", never approached the brilliance in his American endeavors that is on display here.  Chow-Yun Fat's screen charisma was never exploited in his American films.  Lastly, Quentin Tarantino knows how to borrow from the best.  This flick is just a rush from start to finish.  The action setpieces are ingeniously staged.  Characterization, unlike in alot of Western action films, is not compromised for pyrotechnics.  The film's title character is involved in two poignant relationships that are focal to the story, one involving a girl he blinded at a hired hit and another with a maverick police officer played very effectively by Danny Lee.  This film is a success in every aspect 
 Here's the one, parents and grandparents.  Stephen Carpenter's son Tad had loved this story so much that Carpenter decided to write his own version--and am I glad he did!  This is one of my four-year-old's daily requests, and my 13-year-old will still scoop it up for a chuckle from time to time.  What makes this particular edition so great?   1.  Big, fun illustrations.  The goats are different sizes/colors.  The troll is green, knobby, and hairy. 2.  A troll who is just scary enough for a little menace (the littlest goat gruff appears once in his shadow) but is still kind of cute, and very comical when he takes that famous drink.   3.  The cadence and style of the writing is just perfect for doing different voices for the troll and three goats, just like my mom used to do.  The first time she tried it with this book, she remarked, "This is a really good version." 4.  The encounter between the biggest billy goat and the troll is simply thrilling--this is one tough, unintimidated billy goat!  4. The last page is fantastic.  The goats are grazing in a veritable Eden with smiles of satisfaction, and the troll is hilariously peeking out of the water down next to the bridge.   5.  The old-fashioned ending--"snip snap snout, this tale's told out." This family of seven could not love this book any more.  I would not change a single line of the illustrations or a single syllable of the text.  A beaut.  
 "Taking Charge" is another outstanding book from the great presidential historian Michael Beschloss. You will feel like a fly on the wall as LBJ speaks to many politicos, Jackie, Bobby, etc. As the leading civilian authority on the Secret Service, I was especially interested in what LBJ had to say about Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman: "he was as dumb as an ox." Vince Palamara Secret service expert, History Channel, author of 2 books, in over 30 other author's books, etc 
 Elizabeth R, brings to the screen the story of Queen Elizabeth I, the woman responsible for transforming England into a major world power. The setting is England in the 1550's, and King Edward rules the realm having succeeded his father King Henry VIII.  Nevertheless, his health problems will lead to his untimely death and the ascension of Queen Mary to the throne in 1553, only to be followed by Queen Elizabeth in 1558; the rest is pretty much History... Glenda Jackson, Ronald Hines, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!   The clash between England and her adversaries (notably France and Spain) is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism. In addition, the series does a GREAT job of presenting both the queen and the woman in Elizabeth. The only setback is that Elizabeth R does not provide that much of a balanced examination; it is quite biased against Queen Mary (Elizabeth's half sister), and Mary, Queen of Scots (her cousin), both of whom are presented rather negatively. The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! History, Politics, and Intrigue, are all about. It is a BBC miniseries well worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History. 
 Passover is the ultimate home holiday.  But Passover is so much richer than family, friends and food--it is an opportunity to delve into Jewish heritage and find its relevance to so many of today's pressing concerns.David Arnow gives Seder leaders the tools to create spectacular Seders for years to come. Just as the meal takes preparation, the Seder takes preparation beyond using the Haggadah. For all ages, for all levels of knowledge of Jewish history and tradition, David Arnow provides dynamic materials, ideas, questions and methods that are relevant to the present and respectful of the past. No matter how many years you have been conducting Seders, this book will amaze you and enrich your experience 
 The film version is not the same as the Broadway show, but it firmy stands on it's own as does this soundtrack. John Williams' orchestrations are wonderful and Topol brings a more human flavor to the role of Tevye than Mostel's more comic vision of the character. I love both actor's interpretations, though. The CD lacks the fabulous photos which were included in the original 1971 LP edition, but sound-wise it is extremely competent 
 Every year as a child I looked forward to watching Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer during the holidays. In fact, I looked forward to seeing it on TV even as an adult!  Wanting to share this great classic with my 7 year old son, I bought it for him a few weeks ago. Sure, I had it recorded on a VHS along with other Christmas classics, but the quality wasn't that great and we had to endure commercials.  The DVD version seems to be cleaned up from the TV version in terms of quality. I seem to recall more background "fuzzies" when it was on TV (perhaps the DVD was re-mastered?)   The Desinty's Child claymation video is basically worthless, in my opinion, unless you have a little fan of this kind of music (and I don't).   With a run-time of 65 minutes, this DVD has hardly any extras. There's a lost scene which originally aired in place of the song "Why Am I Such A Misfit?" (an optimistic tune about striking out and finding your fortune). You can also view the DVD in Spanish, and my son gets a kick out of doing that once in awhile.   The "previews" for other DVD's--including an annoying promo for one about Peter Rabbit/Easter--seems ENDLESS. It's a shame how they advertise to death on DVD's for youngsters!  And as far as the Rudolph story: well, I was always bothered that Rudolph's Dad rejected him for being different--as well as Santa himself! Very disappointing, but isn't that like life--where people judge based on appearances?  Still, I love the songs on Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Hermie the dentist wanna-be, Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble bring warm holiday nostalgia to our house. And my 7 year old son plays this DVD at least once a day! What more can you ask for? (except maybe some fun extras) 
 First published in 1936, this is the 12th Poirot book, the 3rd Superintendent Battle book, and the 2nd Colonel Race book, and has no narrator. It's the first case in which Superintendent Battle, Mrs. Oliver, or Col. Race appear together with Poirot or each other, and the only case in which *all* do so at once.  The story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes, where Poirot encounters Mr. Shaitana, a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. Shaitana deliberately cultivates a Mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen.  For Shaitana, like a few other collectors in Christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius, but murderers. And being a connoisseur, he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. He amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to Poirot of his hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of "tigers" (Poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.)  Poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer Major Despard, a strong silent type; Mrs. Lorrimer, a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young Anne Meredith; and Dr. Roberts, a loud and jovial general practitioner.  Shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up, and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players!  This is, of course, Poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in THE ABC MURDERS - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. There are only the people themselves, and their memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. Solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. But how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that Shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with?  Rather than following Poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout, some chapters follow Battle, Race, or Mrs. Oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. Each represents a different style: Battle is a professional police officer, Race an empire-builder-type secret agent, and Mrs. Oliver a writer of detective stories. Battle, of course, has a duty to investigate Shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. Race deals with checking out Major Despard, the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. Mrs. Oliver, for her part, works on worming information out of not only Anne Meredith, but her roommate Rhonda (whose attitude is that Anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention).  And, of course, there's Poirot. He's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning: (1) Describe how the bridge games played out, and (2) Describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in Shaitana's house where the bridge games were played).  See if you can figure out where Poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he received 
 I love devil duckies. I have recently started collecting them because they come in so many unique colors and styles. My most beloved devil duckie has to be the tattoed/pierced devil duckie. It is a light tan duckie with a pierced horn and is covered in tattoos. This devil duckie is definitely the coolest with its pierced horn and tattoos. I love the web tattoo on the duckie's behind. On its right cheek is a little devil duckie tattoo with the number 13. Too cute. I think it truly embodies the rebellious spirit of the devil duckie brand. I may be an adult but I am also a kid at heart. Devil duckies aren't your average rubber duckies we all grew up with as kids. I don't think you need to be a kid to collect devil duckies. 
 Blue stone opened up a new interest in the genre of preferred music. It's serene, calm, soothing, has a sort of Enigma effect. Helps me relax after long days of work 
 I liked the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes .In the story Sadako makes the relay team, but when she is running she gets a dizzy spell. So her parents take her to the hospital and she has leukemia .From reading the story,I learned that there was an atomic bomb and leukemia .After reading the story,I felt sad because one day Sadako was making a paper crane and she fell asleep and never woke up. I would recommend this book to my friends because it teaches friendship 
 Edited by Richard Aldington. Stories include the picture of dorian gray, salome, the importance of being earnest, de profundis, many poems and the selfish giant 
 The doll house was just as expected. Easy to asemble. I would think that any one thinking of purchasing one should not hesitate. The delivery time was excelent and would recomend it to any interested party ! 
 Well written and provides a lot detail on the training and planning that went into the invasion of Tarawa.  The description of the fighting and deadly landing is very engaging and descriptive.  The number of casualties suffered by the main landing forces was extremely high, and when historians write that only a certain percentage of casualties suffered based on the total of number personnel that landed, it does an injustice to the extreme hardships that the Marines and Navy personnel faced on the first two days of fighting.  The book also describes the lessons learned from the deadly landing.  What is most interesting however, is the family backlash towards the President over the high loss of life.  Even after the attack on Pearl Harbor there were those anti-war Americans who believed that the US should not be at war with Japan.  Some of those anti-war protestors tried to use the high death toll from the landing as a reason not to continue fighting.  When one compares the past history with current events, it is very noteworthy that regardless of the circumstances, some people will always believe that the military is not necessary and that fighting against those who attack and wish to destroy us is never an option to these extreme peace activists.  Fortunately, we have men and women who understand the risk and sacrifices involved in defending our country while serving overseas in a war.  This book does their memory justice and definitely worth reading 
 There was no marks in the whole book, and the price was great 
 First off this is "A History of Hollywood" not "THE History of Hollywood."  David Thomson isn't writing the chronological, straight-up, blow-by-blow account of Hollywood movies.  "The Whole Equation" is an essay that takes as its question, "are Hollywood films ever art like a Beethoven symphony or a Picasso painting?"  He says they are both more and less than that.  More because American film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen.  That serendipity is wonderful when it works which isn't often.  Less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits.  And unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension.  His argument is that to understand and appreciate American film, you have to understand that it's always about the money and about the art.  That means it is never truly art in any pure way (but is any art truly pure?). To tell you the truth, I don't think the book succeeds that well on that level.  He  points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of American film but he doesn't developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight.  For me, that just didn't matter.  What makes it a terrific read is that David Thomson knows and loves film.  He writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic.  He uses the film "Chinatown" as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie, I was in heaven.  He is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater, the audience, the actors, the costumes, the music, all of it.  He constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film, you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride. 
 Like others, I went looking for the song from the club...I think this is it:  Everthing but the girl:  Five Fathoms, from the cd Temperamental.  This song, gets the 5 stars.  Good stuff 
    Let me start by saying this is my first Greg Iles book and I'll be back for more!     Joe Hickey has pulled off five kidnappings for ransom, each a year apart.  Not only has he not been caught, but none of the parents of the victims ever reported the crime.  Now it's kidnapping time again and Joe sets his sights on Abby Jennings, the five year old daughter of an anesthesiologist and his Junior League wife, who resents her husband's success and social status.     Joe's retarded but lovable cousin, Huey, will take charge of Abby.  Joe's wife Cheryl (a former prostitute) will monitor Abby's dad Will and Hickey himself takes charge of mother Karen who turns out to be a lot tougher than he anticipated. The fact that Abby has juvenile diabetes increases the chance that Will and Karen will never get their daughter back alive.    The action shifts between the Jennings' Mississippi estate where Hickey holds Karen prisoner, to a cabin in the woods where Huey hides Abby to a medical doctor's convention on the Gulf Shore, where Cheryl keeps Will from calling the FBI or police.     As the Jennings parents engage in a battle of wits with Joe and Cheryl Hickey, Abby and the childlike Huey entertain themselves in their secret location.     24 Hours has one of the cleverest criminals and best thought- out plots I've encountered and you really come to care about the Jennings family and their individual fates.  Strongly recommended for page turning reading! 
 I think this is a beautiful book. The photography is gorgeous and I love how the projects are sequential based on experience. For example, you start with a simple scarf (NOT ideal for babies! but good practice), a blanket and then move into pillows and sweaters. I'm working on my first wearable for my new son. The directions are clear for knitting the pieces, but those pertaining to seaming it together are VERY vague. 
 This double CD is based on a legend of a harp left behind by Sir Francis Drake in what is now California; the harp was supposedly placed atop an altar on a cliff at the ocean's edge, where the wind playing over its strings created an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of sounds as the changing weather affected its tuning.  Using a tuning other than the equal temperament that Western music has used for several centuries now guarantees unusual results, but it takes a composer and performer such as Riley to create beauty such as on this CD. You'll hear some traditional musical forms here (waltz and even ragtime!), but from a new point of view. It's easy to get lost in this music, but pay attention. It's worth it 
 I've almost worn out my copy, & have recommended it to everyone I know who is interested in down-to-earth, country-style Japanese food.  Not only does the author give ingredients & quantities, he explains why & how various cooking techniques evolved.  You won't find the usual Japanese restaurant favorites, but there are other books for those.  The breakfast ideas & recipes alone make this worth reading -- a great alternative to eggs-toast-bacon-cereal.  One minor quibble, which may have been remedied in this edition:  the indexing & general organization of the book are a bit tricky.  Dishes are usually listed by their Japanese names, or by their method of cooking, & the page number references in the index are not always reliable.  So get a pack of Post-It notes or some bookmarks (my copy is full of them), but by all means get this book 
 The way this story does present itself may be a similar idea to Young Goodman Brown by Nathaniel Hawthorne in which upon traveling through the woods he encounter's what turns out to be a nightmare of the supernatural an intermix of fantasy,reality, & the super natural.Possibly not knowing if it's a dream or a reality but it's an adventure on the whole that's very enjoyable from start to finish.    
 A very concise yet informative survey of world history from the antiquity. This book touches almost everything important in history. Could be used both for recreational reading and also as a primer in world history for a university/school course. The only flaw in the book is that it stops abruptly in 1932. No fault of Mr Nehru, though. I guess someone should work on this book and bring it up to date 
 I don't know how I managed to go this long without being aware of James W. Hall, but I did. I was a huge Travis McGee fan and, although Hall's Thorn character is quite different from John D. McDonald's wonderful knight-errant, it was great to return to south Florida for a terrific story. Thorn is a much more gritty character than McGee, and Hall's writing style is also grittier. Thorn is a hermit-like eccentric with a troubled past who earns a living in the Florida Keys making bonefish lures. He winds up in the middle of a mystery that he decides to resolve himself. Hall describes his setting beautifully and fills his version of the Keys with some odd and quirky characters. All of his characters, even the minor ones, are rich and well fleshed out. The story flows smoothly and the pages fly by. I'm looking forward to reading all of Hall's mysteries, especially those featuring the Thorn character. Very highly recommended 
 I never knew there was a history of girls refusing to eat. This book starts all the way back from Midevial times up until the 1980's, when the book was written. I found it extremely fascinating. I would reccommend this book to anyone with an eating disorder, people who are into psychology or history, or just if you are looking for a great non-fiction book. Do not pass this one up 
 This is one of the best recreational math books I have ever read.  The humorous real life scenarios lead to deep mathematical concepts.  I use this book in a class for future mathematics teachers.  Hopefully, it will inspire them to make math fun for their students 
 This book has helped me in ways that I never imagined. The information in this book has been extremely useful in my quest to better understand myself and others. "Bringing Out the Best in Yourself at Work" is very much a must read for anyone interested in improving their relationships at work and in life in general.   
 I have been buying books at Amazon for years, and this is the first review I ever felt compelled to write. Simply put, this is the book I buy and give to family and friends. The knowledge contained in this book is potent and reflect the juicy nuggets of a lucious truth that can be known and experienced in this life. Why just connect with the font of life when you can merge fully into it. I highly recommend this book 
 Great feel good movie and we love the Red Sox. Never get tired of watching the movie and now have the grandkids into it 
 Russell is not concerned with refuting the claims of any specific religion with philosophic rigor. He shouldn't be. Since religion is not based on evidence, carefully refuting it would be like refuting the ancient Greek belief that Zeus and other gods reside on Mount Olympus. The only difference between that religion and current religions is that the Greek pantheon is out of fashion.  If you are a staunch believer and want to test your faith by subjecting it to a withering logical assault, you are wasting your time with this book (In fact, you are wasting your time period, since faith has nothing to do with logical arguments). If you want to read the thoughts of a great 20th century thinker on religion, and understand why he rejects it, then enjoy. I think that Russell is one of those men who values truth over everything else - a rare quality, even (especially?) among the followers of organized religion 
 If you're at an edge in your life and you feel like you've searched and scratched every possible corner for some more breathing space and growing room with and in yourself -- and you are wondering if you can remain married, are having thoughts of letting go to "find yourself" but you're also heartbroken at that thought... read this book.  Within the first few pages, I burst into tears feeling seen, known and understood AND I was given the space and encouragement I desperately needed to stretch myself and my marriage in positive ways.  This book has been thoroughly researched and is well-organized and written with such flow and ease.  What a positive service Ms. Jarvis has gifted wives/mothers/women and those who love them.  She has beautifully addressed and offered ideas for something so many women face in silence, guilt and even shame.  I have seen too many marriages break up, that could have been repaired, had this book found its way to them.  For quality relationships and marriages -- this is a healthy breadcrumb for the path.  Thank you Cheryl Jarvis!  I also recommend (more breadcrumbs) Joan Anderson's books A YEAR BY THE SEA and A WEEKEND TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  Small steps.. 
 Kellerman's Delaware novels are complex, entertaining and keep you interested from start to finish 
 THIS IS IN MY OPINION HIS FINEST RECORDING EVER. THERE IS ONLY ONE SONG THAT IS TOTALY OUT OF PLACE (BREAK DOWN THE DOOR). THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS FULL OF MELANCHOLIC SAD BALLADS WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY AND REMEMBER ME OF MY CHILDHOOD DAYS AND EARLY GIRLFRIENDS AND THAT FIRST TO BE IN LOVE FEELING. I ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND HIS 1989 AND LAST "REAL" STUDIO RECORDING "BARRY MANILOW". IS THIS REALLY THE ARTIST WHO PUT OUT SOME OF THE WORST RECORDS EVER A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER (HERE COMES THE NIGHT FROM 1982 AND THE MANILOW 1985) 
 The first thing I noticed about this album is that strong "beats" are featured very prominently on nearly every track.  All kinds of beats - straightforward rock, synth, exotic, jungle, you name it.  You'll like this if beats are important to you, as they are to me.  The second thing I noticed is that overall it sounds somewhat subdued, including Debbie's vocals.  Her seductive persona is still in evidence, though not as triumphantly as before.  But, really - what could measure up to "Autoamerican", especially at a time when the band members were going through such serious problems?  There are still some interesting sounds on here.  "Dragonfly" is an excellent track, with a complex, relentless beat and a hypnotic vocal by Debbie.  "The Beast" features some very good guitar work as well as some "Rapture"-like rap.  Other tracks have excellent guitar work too.  "English Boys" has jangly guitars that remind me of 60's folk-rock, and Debbie sings it in a strangely sweet voice that is quite appealing.  "The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game" manages to have a retro R&B sound, updated for the 80's.  The final track, the extended version of "War Child", goes back to Euro-disco for inspiration, sounding a little like Donna Summer's "I Feel Love" in places, while a couple of other tracks remind me of the "Parallel Lines" sound.  So, although this is certainly not Blondie's most accomplished album, neither is it the failure that some claim it to be.  Timing is everything, and that was a bad time for Blondie.  I would say, give it a try, especially if you are a fan 
 American adolescent Kate and her sister Frankie live with their mother in Hong Kong. It is the summer of 1967; their father is mostly away, photographing scenes from the Vietnam War for Time magazine. Through their father's stories and photographs, and also through newspaper articles, the Vietnam War is constantly and immediately present to Kate and Frankie, forming both a backdrop to their lives in Hong Kong and a rival for their father's attention.  The atmosphere is sultry. Twelve-year-old Kate and older sister Frankie swim in the ocean and play on the beach. One day while swimming, a dead Chinese woman floats up out of the water. That shocking sight changes the girls, marking the end of their innocence.  Hong Kong is full of unrest, with Red Guards planting bombs to encourage the British to leave. There is anarchy in Canton, resulting in corpses in the streets and washing up onto the beaches. With Kate's father gone six weeks at a time, her mother Marianne yearns to protect her daughters, all the while feeling vulnerable. However, Marianne's protective nature is hindered by her profound naiveté and a tendency toward denial.  The two girls differ. Frankie is voluptuous, dark and strong; Kate is small, slight, asthmatic and blonde. Their personalities are also dissimilar. Frankie is a daredevil, verging on being out of control; Kate is quiet and takes the time to notice the details of her life.  One day the girls are in the marketplace with Ah Bing, their nanny/housekeeper. Frankie persuades Kate to slip away to watch the Red Guards' demonstration. When the police arrive, the girls try to return to Ah Bing, but two rough men grab them. One holds Frankie; the other orders Kate to take a heavy bag, supposedly containing lychee fruit, to the police. Kate, terrified senseless for her sister, drifts toward the police, feeling like gwaimui (white ghost girl) while conscious of the fact that she's being used as a pawn. Hostilities escalate between the police and the Red Guards as she continues on, aware that the bag is too heavy for fruit. What happens next is devastating.  Soon the house is awash with guilt, fear, shame, denial and wariness. What happened in the village that day transforms both girls, who react in different ways. Frankie spirals into a wild self-destruction as Kate watches, feeling helpless and angry. Kate hopes someone will notice and attend to their despair. But no matter what they say or do, Kate and Frankie feel invisible, like white ghosts. Their mother is afraid to truly see them; their father can only see Vietnam even when he's physically with them.  The suspense builds slowly in this family tragedy, beginning with the first page, as Kate and Frankie hurtle inevitably toward disaster. The reader's every sense is engaged, thanks to a poetic and lushly detailed description of the exotic setting. Reading WHITE GHOST GIRLS feels like drifting, fear-filled, through a foreign land within a sultry dream while being pierced through with Kate's emotions: love, jealousy, passion, loss and longing. Highly recommended.     --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com

 Those of us who read and enjoyed Santa's Twin know that sisters, Emily and Charlotte had to save Christmas last year (the events in this story take place a year later) by rescuing the real Santa Claus after his deranged twin brother, Bob, stuffed poor Santa in a sack, dropped him into the basement, then hijacked the sleigh and reindeer.  Oh, the awful things crazy Bob left in unsuspecting kids' Christmas stockings!  This time around, Bob is repentent and tries to make amends by building a robot Santa that will take some of the burden off his jolly brother, Nicholas.  But, of course, the robot malfunctions on its first stop on Christmas Eve, Emily and Charlotte's house, and winds up TAKING instead of giving.  It's one calamity after another as Emily and Charlotte try to prevent Robot Santa from destroying their house without awakening their parents. Their dog, Woofer, loyal pooch that he is, tries to help but is sidetracked by a trained gorilla named Keith who is supposed to be piloting the sleigh but instead goes into the girls' kitchen to whip up a tasty treat.  Woofer is undone by his stomach, and follows the gorilla.  All seems lost!  Will Emily and Charlotte manage to get a message to Santa before Robot Santa turns their house into a disaster area?  This was a funny follow-up to Santa's Twin.  I wonder what's going to happen to the put-upon sisters next year.  Hopefully Bob will get some therapy.  After all, it isn't easy being the brother of someone as perfect as Santa Claus.  I loved the illustrations as much as I did the hilarious story itself.  Especially the drawing of Woofer floating through the air after a fall from the roof.  The expression on his face is priceless! LOL 
 Turning Angel is a legal thriller worth reading.  Set in Natchez, Mississippi, it has some of the same characters as one of the author's earlier books, 'The Quiet Game'.  It is about a standout high school student, Kate Townsend, who is found raped and murdered.  During the investigation of the case, a prominent local doctor, Drew Elliot, becomes a suspect due to his rumored sexual involvement with the victim.  Attorney turned novelist Penn Cage, who is one of the repeat characters, is involved as the suspect has been his best friend since childhood.  Elliot wants Cage to represent him.  The story is quite well done and certainly holds one's attention.  It contains deceit, adultery, violent drug gangs, teenage thugs, and more.  There is also a great deal of exploration of the dark side of the modern day high school subculture.    The story itself is quite riveting and well done.  I am a bit disappointed with the author in this book as he seems to try to justify or at least turn a blind eye toward relationships between middle aged men and teenage girls.  In spite of that, it is a good novel and will not bore readers 
 Here for once is first hand musical theatre history written by someone who took part in the making of some extraordinary shows. A dancer who worked with Bob Fosse (as both a performer and an assistant) gives us her personal  insights in how the man worked.  It is a very rare thing to get such an  intimate view from inside the creative process.  Ever wonder why  "Fosse dancers" are a breed apart?  This book is a great place to  start finding the answer 
 I love how this transmitter and {MP3 player} help to transform an otherwise mind-numbingly dull commute to work into an entertaining and occasionally educational experince.  Depending on what I have programmed into my Sansa, I can listen to books or my latest music purchase.  The sound quality is excellent and I am quite pleased with my purchase.  I was also happy that the price was much more reasonable than the 'pod' option with all it's high-priced accessories. I plan to buy a second one (for my husband's truck) in time for Christmas 
 i watched this film after viewing Nathaniel Kahn's more personal depiction of his father. The latter one is an intimate conversation with the dead. This one is asking the viewers to share the growing process of a living person, in parallel to and through events in the recent history of the USA. A leitmotif of time and history running along with personal perception and interpretation of these events.  Maya's architecture, funny to say, is a lot about the sensuality of touch, which goes beyond the visual. Never in any other film about an architect's work does the audience being so moved - by the detail depiction of a hand touching a piece of stone engraved with names; the quiet flow of a thin film of water over a piece of stone being interrupted by the tip of fingers tracing the history of a place....tears.... We see in Kahn's architecture an emptiness of self in order to contain the infinity of the universe in the most cerebral way; while Lin's is an embracement of the past, present and future in the most romantic and sensuous. Sometimes i wonder if it is turning architecture into too much an emotional apparatus?  Anyway, i would recommend such interesting parallel viewing of the two films about these 2 american architects 
 Every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator.   The mid-first century of Rome was such a time and Tacitus was such a communicator.  The Histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history.   The historian will do well to read Tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity.   While observing and commenting on the human element in history, Tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil, wars, and rumors of wars.  His beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity.  His example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow.  A word on this translation in particular - I found Mr. Wellesley's translation very readable and poetic.  He seems to have captured the literature value of the text as well as the content.  Well done 
 If you love animals, you have to read this book. This is the most inspirational and enlightening book on the subject of animals that you can read and it changed my life forever.

 This telling account of life on the south side of Chicago is worth reading to catch a glimpse of the struggles and hardships that marginalize this south side community. The narrative and accounts of life in Chicago's public housing complexes unveil the social conflict that is tucked away from viewing and ignored by outsiders.   To shed light on the situation, two teenagers, assigned by the National Public Radio, conduct interviews with family members, neighbors, and friends throughout the text. During the process of their interviews, they describe the everyday life and hopes of escaping the self destruction of  those who must live in the projects especially Ida B. Wells public housing.  The book is a short read of two hundred pages with a reading level of sixth grade. Despite the simplicity of the layout of the accounts, the descriptions of urban city life and death are profound. Since the teenagers' interviews, some of the public housing complexes have been brought down. The south side of Chicago is beginning to prosper as new schools and businesses bring opportunity and hope to a community that seemed abandoned.   Whether you are a student, parent, or professional, reading this book will make you want to take action to rebuild our community.

 I heard so much about Masaki Kobayashi's "Harakiri", so I bought it at Amazon and watched it.  Wow, this movie is awesome!!  Now I don't know who is my #1 favorite director, Akira Kurosawa or Masaki Kobayashi. This black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by Tohru Takemitsu.  In addition to these assets, the camera is wonderful.  I pick this movie as one of "my movies of my life".  Tatuyua Nakadai was shining in this movie.  I like him more after seeing "Harakiri".  
 I purchased this book in hopes of decreasing or eliminating my 11.5 year old son's Ritalin. He started the vitamins/minerals/and Omega 3 and so far we have eliminated dairy products and prepared waffles and cereals switching to wheat, gluten, and milk free waffle mix, and increased water consumption- 6 days ago. His teacher asked me what I changed at home on day 5; she asked because he had an excellent week. The timing was not planned but the week coincided with the state standardized testing- he didn't even use the scribe his IEP states he's entitled to!! I will soon decrease his Ritalin working closely with his psychiatrist, therapist, teachers, and sports coaches. I have already recommended this book to school staff and parents. 
 This is one of those books that is quite simple on the first read, but reveals a much deeper level of insight as you begin to apply the principles.  Mindfulness as a concept is difficult for westerners who have been taught to rationalize everything, but it is an essential skill for seeing things as they truly are.  Gunaratana gives the reader a step-by-step system for learning the basics, and introduces Buddhist concepts gently, in a non confrontational way.  He is not saying that Vipissana meditation is the only way to experience the world, but that it is one way.    This book has changed the way I look at the world, and given me tools to understand what I am experiencing.  An incredible value and an incredible book 
 This movie is another must for all fans of film-noir and/or Bogart & Bacall - an excellent and totally unique and original story with outstanding cinematic technique.  DVD is a very high-quality preservation of the original film 
  I bought this frame for my wife. She has alot of digital pictures and no good way to see them all. After reading the reviews by others, I decided to try this one. She loves it. With the little card reader we have for our computer, she can drag and drop her photos to an SD card. Then just plug in the card, hook up the AC power, and turn on the frame. It goes to the slide show automatically.   We didn't bother to re-size or crop the photos. The 1/2" black bars on each side of the photo just aren't that bothersome to us. No remote controls or sound features but if you're looking for a simple frame to just show off all your digital photos, at a reasonable price, this one is great 
 This is a rare thing - a scholarly study that you can't put down. It's beautifully written, enlightening and thoroughly researched all at once. I strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Batman in particular or popular culture in general. Superb 
 If you like the Catholic Flannery O'Connor's depth analysis of human nature, and can endure its frequent morbidity; if you like Evelyn Waugh's sense of humor and thought The Loved One was amusing; try Walker Percy.  Walker Percy is Evelyn Waugh on crack.  And the place to start is with Percy's Love in the Ruins.  It's not his first novel, or even the first to win him recognition (that would be his Moviegoer).  But it's a tour-de-force analysis of the human condition in a Louisiana setting by a womanizing, semi-alcoholic, lapsed Catholic protagonist who, despite (or by means of?) the hyterical laughter of the reader, sheds new light at every turn on the human condition.  One imagines the brilliant Percy, with twinkling eye, smiling down upon the event.  (The next book to read must be Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book, a book unlike any other in the cosmos -- not a novel, but another absolute must-read 
 Victoria Newhouse adds to her growing list of superb publications (Towards a New Museum, Wallace K. Harrison) this insightful volume about art and the importance of presentation.  These curatorial decisions are shared for the first time in a manner that is readable and informative and provides a pathway to understanding the subtleties of 'showing art'.  When a painting or a sculpture impacts us, makes us stop in our museum promenade and freezes our attention long enough to send our minds back to the origins of the work as well as free our eyes to truly SEE the art, there is in Newhouse's informative writing a reason that goes beyond the greatness of the work itself.  From the color of the walls in the space to the lighting techniques to the proximity of other works of art and their ability to enhance - all these are issues Newhouse not only discusses, but also illustrates in this richly colorful book.  Newhouse takes the time to walk us through the history of presentation in museums, palaces, churches, and public spaces, even finding such odd manner of hanging as the 'studiolo' concept one to define and illustrate.  Through these references she guides us into the sanctum sanctorum of curatorial decisions and how today's museum curators not only organize an exhibition, but also study and execute the hanging with all the modern accoutrements that make the exhibition a meaningful experience for the viewer.  This fine, lavishly illustrated  volume is so well written that it must become a bible for all museums, but it is also available to the public, allowing those of us who ponder greatness some windows into the thoughtful logistics of art presentation.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, May 06  
 Huston hits a homer again with "Six Bad Things".  With out spoiling the plot, this is a sequel to "Caught Stealing", so if you haven't read the first book... do so now!  "Six Bad Things" continues the story of Hank Thompson, the protagonist of "Caught Stealing", and man it is one hell of a ride!  What really draws a reader in is Huston's sparse style.  With it he crafts stark and unrelenting pictures in his reader's imagination.  This book is proof positive that Mr. Huston is here to stay and will forever leave an indelible mark on crime fiction.  This writer is in the same league as Chandler and Hammett.  If you like your stories well crafted, fast paced, filled with wild but believable characters and hard boiled than, brother, you've just found the right book! 
 Bailie draws on Rene Girard's theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force, and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence.  I found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory.  Bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory, producing a hard-hitting indictment of all forms of violence, whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act.  Increasingly, I find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice.  I have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading Violence Unveiled, nor do I react to photojournalism with my previous detachment.  The impact stays with me, despite the fact that I read the work initially two years ago when I borrowed it from a friend.  I now have my own copy, heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by Bailie's excellent analyses.  Provocative and insightful 
 I purchased this CD this past weekend and I wished I had bought it the first day it came out!! Totally anointed, I've always been a fan of Kelly's and have all of her secular cd's as well. She has a powerful, spirit moving voice and I always knew she would return to her roots.  I watched her do a duet with Bishop Paul Morton on BET Gospel Awards and she brought me to my feet.  I love this cd and you will enjoy it too 
 I've been listening to this record for 40 years now.  It is an amazing, piece of music.  I'm glad to see that others have enjoyed it as much as I.

 I join the other reviewers in wishing there were more detailed city street maps in this series. As others have said if you are traveling from one city to another by major roads then you are better off with mapquest directions (as dodgy as they sometimes are) or the foldout highway map you can buy at a gas station. However, if you travel back roads, camp, fish, hike, canoe, etc., then this book is invaluable. I have relied on this book to provide us with out of the way camping spots and it's never let me down. Most state and national forest campgrounds don't appear on highway maps, but this book has them. It's also especially useful if you want to find alternative routes, scenic drives, or short cuts off of major highways. 
 I never used to really buy into astrology for the simple reason that I knew the 30,000,000 or so other Libras in the U.S. were not all exactly like me. I also refused to believe that the million or so people who shared my birthday were all like me. Then I picked up this book (which wasn't easy given its weight!) and used it to produce a chart for myself that was based on the day, year, and even TIME of my birth. The result nailed me so perfectly (and not always in a complimentary way) that it was frightening.  What was great about this book was the way it used the positions of the planets, sun, and moon at the time of my birth to create a reading divided into ten different aspects of my personality. This is how it's able to create a profile that is so unique even for people born on the same date but in a different year. After all, George W. Bush and the Dalai Lama were born on the same date -- it's the different years of their birth that make the difference!  What's most astounding, however, are the charts included in the book which provide the planetary positions all the way up to 2025, allowing you to create a reading for any future day. It then shows you how to compare this reading to your own chart in order to see what the possible interactions (positive, negative and neutral) might be for you on that upcoming day. This alone makes it worth its price.  Of course, the only way you're able to do this is because the book provides you all of the charts you need. I don't know what the reviewer from Publisher's Weekly is criticizing up above. The charts are the whole point of this book and the thing that makes it so unbelievably useful. Considering that the review got so many other facts wrong (there's nearly 200 pages of non-chart material, and the 12 traditional Zodiac signs are divided into 48 new periods, not 36) shows that the reviewer was basically clueless and didn't understand the true value of this book at all.  If I have a negative critique, it would be that gathering up the information pertinent to you requires a lot of flipping back and forth. This title practically screams for a CD-Rom version that would assemble the material all by itself and compare it to selected future dates automatically. I hope the publisher will consider this with some future edition.      And finally, I also have to mention how gorgeous this book is. All the other stuff aside, it's just a pleasure to flip through, with it's unique design and stunning full-color artwork. For anyone interested in astrology, I can't imagine a better gift than this.  PS: I did find a mistake on one of the charts, but I went to the book's website listed on the back cover, and the publisher had already caught the mistake and posted the correct information. Later editions of the book should be fine 
 WW2 Combat veteran John Hodiak wakes up in a Honolulu military hospital with his jaws wired shut, face bandaged, and memory totally gone in the solid Joseph Mankiewicz directed film-noir "Somewhere in the Night".  After a long convalescence he heads to Los Angeles based on a letter he has in his possession from a friend Larry Cravat.  He learns that his name is George Taylor, as it is inscribed on his wallet.  He begins asking around for Cravat in a local nightclub and immediately becomes the focus of mayhem courtesy of some shady locals. Hodiak meets and then confides his plight to nighclub singer Christy Smith played by attractive brunette Nancy Guild.  She refers him to her boss Mel Phillips played by Richard Conte who helps by introducing him to slick L.A. detective Don Kendall played by Lloyd Nolan.  We learn that Larry Cravat and two million dollars have mysteriously disappeared three years ago.  The plot proceeds chronicling the revelation of the identity of Hodiak and the whereabouts of the money.  While the film was nothing outstanding, it certainly was a convincing drama with satisfying storylines and acting performances

 One of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist.  Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States.  Redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed.  He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics.    Redford has always been a political animal, with a reporter's instinct, and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the American political climate.  Earlier, he and director Michael Ritchie had made THE CANDIDATE, a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women (and a film well worth your time).    It took two years of hard work to get ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN off the ground.  It was turned down by several studios, with the excuse that people were tired of Watergate, but he was finally able to get Warner Bros. to say yes, provided Redford himself would star.    Dustin Hoffman was enlisted to play Carl Bernstein, Redford's old friend Jason Robards won an Oscar as Washington Post Editor-In-Chief Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden was cast as Editor Harry Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam was Editor Howard Simons, Jane Alexander was Judy Hoback, bookkeeper to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (C.R.E.E.P.), Ned Beatty was Martin Dardis, who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence, Stephen Collins was Hugh Sloan, whose wife Debbie (played by Meredith Baxter) kept his conscience working on the right side, Robert Walden (who would go on the the fine television series LOU GRANT) was Dirty Trickster Donald Segretti, and Hal Holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story:  the mysterious Deep Throat, who helped Woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall.  Of course, we now know that Deep Throat was the FBI's Assistant Director W. Mark Felt, an old friend of Woodward's and a man torn between his loyalty to the FBI and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on.    Redford asked Alan J. Pakula to direct and Gordon Willis to handle the cinematography, and they crafted a look that is part documentary, part thriller. (If you get a chance, also see Pakula and Willis' THE PARALLAX VIEW, starring Warren Beatty.  Another outstanding, scary political film.)  William Goldman, who won an Oscar for BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, wrote the tight, exciting screenplay for which he won again (this was actually the fourth time Redford and Goldman had worked together; Goldman also adapted Donald E. Westlake's THE HOT ROCK, a very funny caper film, and the poignant THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, which was out for a short time on DVD in Pan and Scan, but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful Widescreen splendor.  Universal, where are you?)  The efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN a smashing success.  It succeeds as an exciting, suspenseful procedural, as a statement on the neccessity of a free press, as a character study, and as a great movie-movie.    The double-disc DVD set is the one to buy:  the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp, clean 1:85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by Redford himself.  The second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film, on Woodward and Bernstein, and on Deep Throat.  There is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film, and an interview with Jason Robards on the Dinah Shore show.  A deserved landmark in film and in journalism, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be, a must-own.  In our darkest hour, when all seems obfuscated and hopeless, it reminds us that light can be brought to bear.  People CAN make a difference 
 I'm a big fan of Robert Sabuda's work and I love his books.  I collect them for myself as they are too delicate and exquisite for little hands. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a wonderful example of Sabuda's talents.  Each page is a surprise and a treat! From the very beginning you are welcomed by an wonderful forest with hidden faces among the trees.  The very last page shows Alice surrounded by decks of playing cards popping out of the page. This is a wonderful book as are all of Sabuda's pop ups.  I highly recommend it!     
 Dan Reingold has written what must surely be the definitive account of the analyst scandals of the nineties, a sold behind-the-scenes look at Wall Street.  This book is so well written that I read it in one sitting, more or less. Highly recommended 
 Greg Grandin's Empire's Workshop is a work of enormous synthetic breadth.  While it is a commonplace for commentators to point out that many of the policy analysts and foreign policy specialists that staffed the Reagan administration have also staffed the George W. Bush administration, in my reading Grandin's work is the first to chart the philosophical, policy and propagandistic correlations between them.    Grandin demonstrates that many of the techniques employed by the Bush administration to garner and sustain support for its wars and to employ effective disinformation were forged and refined in the laboratory (or "workshop" as Grandin puts it) of Central America during the Reagan years.  Particularly novel is Grandin's analysis of how both Reagan and Bush curried the active support of the USA religious right in pursuit of its foreign and military policy aims.  In the end, the reader realizes that the Reagan years became a template for the Bush years.    The book is brilliant.  I found it difficult to put it down 
 Without hesitation, this film has been one the best achieved ones of the decade; not only because the formidable directorial accuracy (the best film of Petersen after his masterpiece Das Boot) ; there also other highlights such the towering performance of Eastwood as the agent who failed to protect JFK thirty years ago and the breathtaking acting of John Malkovich as the killer, the script is sharp and incisive and explores the undermined conscious filled of a strong sense of missed responsibility at the moment to avoid the inevitable murder in 1963. So in this brilliant thriller we assist once to a cat and mouse game in which one of them will have to fail in order to redeem himself or fail again.   Tense, absorbing and well made thriller.  
 Despite the modest price, this set of blown crystal light weight glasses is artfully elegant, in the fine tradition of Italian design, and will certainly enhance anyone's enjoyment of the fruit of the gods. Compares favorably with the heavily advertised Reidel and Waterford glassware, except it is lighter 
 Alice McDermott's narrators are all sharp observers. They see things you might miss. If you like subtlety, you'll find it here as she flits like a butterfly among the characters while they struggle in slightly adverse circumstances. All the little trials of life in Queens, the bus rides, the bills to pay for sending kids to school when there are financial limitations, the meeting of life's challenges, ordinary people doing their best to keep themselves steady while stormy winds blow around them. Why aren't these stories made into films?  Nadine Gall 
 The commentary from the history professor contained in the special features was excellent. It added a new dimension to the spectacle as it explained the background to what was being viewed as as well as interesting information as to what happened to the sinister characters that were being displayed on the screen 
 The author demystifies writer's block as a natural, manageable part of the writing life.

 I was impressed with Jeff Tweedy's boldness with the crowd and his ability to perform songs (solo) that I had only heard with Wilco.  
 This book delves deeply into the first season of my favorite TV show. If you are looking for background about the episodes, creators and actors I can't think of a better companion. I can't wait for the season four edition 
 This is an exceptionally well documented expose on the socialistic,  communistic, anti-American beliefs of the ACLU.  The ACLU is not the paragon of pro-americanism that it's press releases aver, but rather a negative force bent on destroying America as we know it.  One that is truly out to change the American way, the American tradition, and America's core belief in God and country.  Per the ACLU patriotism and the constitution should be shoved aside for a new world view.  The ACLU was founded by an avowed communist and cannot be trusted.  Read this book to find out why.  Read this book to find out who the Aliance Defense Fund (AFD) is and why their anti ACLU stance is so important to all Americans

 The Age of Innocence is an exercise in ironic nostalgia.  While ridiculing the hypocrisy, strictures, and sense of entitlement of turn-of-the-century New York aristocracy, Edith Wharton ends her novel with a modern world that is free of such twisted morality, but also devoid of passion, noble restraint, and appreciation of the human experience.    Couched in the first unappealing context is a tale of awkward love, with rough edges and misunderstood silences. Newland Archer, although married to May Welland, is drawn to her cousin Ellen Olenska.  Ellen has a casual relationship with the petty proprieties of aristocratic New York, and his disillusionment with his marriage and society is matched by hers. Although rebels in spirit, Newland and Ellen are ultimately guided by a simple morality based on the very real consequences of human interactions.  The Age of Innocence provokes discussion by raising questions but rarely suggesting any answers. After savaging the strictures of old New York, Wharton leaves us with a gem of an observation that love, in fact, may be diluted by the modern freedoms we now enjoy:  "`The difference is that these young people take it for granted that they're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took it for granted that we shouldn't. Only, I wonder - the thing one's so certain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?'"  Similarly, she not only questions those who pretend to be virtuous, but also the very virtues themselves.  "Archer felt irrationally angry.  His host's contemptuous tribute to May's `niceness' was just what a husband should have wished to hear said of his wife. The fact that a coarse-minded man found her lacking in attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words sent a faint shiver through his heart. What is `niceness' carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness?"  May is virtuous by contemporary standards: she is modest, humble, soft-spoken, and kind. Yet these virtues form but a veil to hide the vacuity of her character. Intelligent enough to see through the hypocritical morality of her time, she has neither the desire to do so, nor the will to do anything but adhere to it herself. Yet the partially gender-segregated structure of society, combined with her evident virtues, make her an ideal spouse.  Definitions of virtue may have changed for us in our time, but the struggle between virtue and vacuity is a constant. Perhaps we should take a page out of Wharton's playbook: let us incessantly question that which we hold dear, lest it slip away 
  Its too bad these guys had to grow up. After two completley immature LICSENSED TO ILL and the genius (but still juvenile) PAULS BOUTIQUE it seemed that there was nowhere left to go. They had dominated the mainstream rap scene; but now the scene was changing and rap music was becoming a little more complex. Was there still room for BRINGING ALICE THE MEAT? What happened here, was the boys decided to "go back to their roots" this meant basically, playing instruments. As we know BEASTIES were once a punk band- and not to mention very intuetive when it came to music in general. This album is a new phase for BEASTIE BOYS music, yet still incredible stuff. Just stuff to dig on. A few (more earthy) hip hop styles, some awesome instrumental jams, some punk, some somethin' somethin' somethin'.  Its a lot of stuff, but it doesn't seem like they are lost at all. They have become very in tune with themselves... And though we were laughing with the BEASTIES all along, something about this one made it look like they'd be laughing last. VERY GOOD WA 
 Wow.  Being one of the many people who saw the movie first, I was immediately surprised at how radically different the book was from its cinematic adaptation.  Starting off in the latter years of the 20th Century (already a major difference), the book was an intricately-woven web of mystery, magic, and wonder.  It's next to impossible to write an adequate review of the book (or the movie, for that matter) without giving away too much (even a little bit would be too much!), and I'm sure that the other reviews give enough information on their own.  This was a very intimate, truly MYSTERIOUS, and dark story.  So dark even, that in some ways, it was even darker than the movie (which went for a more obvious - even conventional - angle on the story).  I loved it, and movie fan or not, you probably will, too 
 I am so glad this finally came out on DVD.  I'm 40 now, but I vividly remember seeing this on HBO (I don't ever remember it being in theatres) in 1979 and how much I related to it, even though I grew up in the Rust Belt and not in a planned housing project.  The soundtrack was classic.  I had it on vinyl at one time.  It had a lot of what we listened to, but we also would have had Aerosmith, Kiss, Nugent, Sabbath, Kansas etc.  Bring on the CD!  We all thought Pamela Ludwig was such a babe at the time.  It would be interesting to see her now.  This movie deserved much better than what it got, especially since it launched Matt Dillon's career.  One thing I found refreshing about the "extras" was that it didn't go into every minute detail of the movie (I sold my copy of the extended version of "LOTR: The Return Of The King" because all the extras bored me to death) but told some interesting facts.  Highly recommended 
 Being a professional psychic myself, I thought I would read "Diary of a Psychic" and see what Sonia had to say about her experiences.  I found this book to be a very enjoyable read, something I can't say about some other psychics' books.  Sonia's story was very interesting and I could relate well to many of the things that she experienced as a young psychic.  If you want to see what it's like to live with psychic ability, I would recommend this book. --Rev. Jeff www.revjeff.co 
 Brings out facts about Joshua and his leadership that can be made an example to us today. Not dull or boring in any way. Stuck to the facts and didn't "make" things fit their agenda. This is an excellent book and I recommend that everyone read it 
 Though a new cook, I'd already grown tired of boring chicken dishes & pastas and wanted to try something new.  I can't believe how tasty the recipes are in this book.  When my dinner companion and I sat down to eat the Chicken in Pomegranate Sauce (chosen because the author said it was her favorite), we actually started laughing.  It was so tasty it actually made us silly and we giggled while we ate (maybe because we couldn't believe I had produced this gem). I'm going to try the meatballs next.  What an incredible book 
 I tell my life coaching clients that even one of these poems makes for an loving guide as to how to live your life.  Her poem, Mindful, eloquently points the way to a life of joy and fullness for anyone.  Yes 
 Do you love the writings of Ken Kesey? Buy this.  Do you want to relive a magic moment in the past, or want a better understanding of what the spirit of the 60s was all about? Buy this!  Do you want to laugh, cry, and have a great time? Buy this!!  Spit in the Ocean #7 brings to a conclusion a project Ken Kesey started more than a quarter of a century ago. In 1974, he laid out plans to self-publish seven issues of a literary magazine by this title, each issue to have a different theme and editor. By 1981, six issues had appeared, but the leader of the Merry Pranksters was ready to move on to other ventures.  Now, two year's after Kesey's departure at age 66, his friend Ed McClanahan has edited that final issue of "Spit," appropriately all about the man who gave the world so much joy. There are contributions from famous names like Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe and Larry McMurtry, but there's also lots from others who were touched by Kesey's boundless spirit and zest for life.  There are letters, interviews, memoirs, song lyrics, photos and more between these covers. I bet Kesey would have loved it. If they could have somehow included a DVD and scratch-and-sniff, he would have loved it even better. This book does a wonderful service in keeping alive the spirit of the writer, painter, filmmaker, jester, teacher, activist, wrestler, leader and lover of life named Ken Kesey.--William C. Hal 
 This book is a guide to sanity for those who have experienced mild brain injury, as I have. In the fall of 2000, I suffered an accidental fall and spent the following 15 months in a struggle to recover my 'real self". With the aid of this book, I am now fully functional again and able to cope with the minor relapses. I strongly recommend this book to those who suffer, their friends and caregivers 
 This is a fantastic story. It sparks children and adults (I'm 53!) the imagination and creativity that will help make the world a more beautiful place. I hence started to write my own children's stories. Amy Tan is my inspiration, and I hope she becomes yours. 
 I'm a big star wars fan and I very much enjoy seeing the story contiue on in all different forms of media. This volume is a must have for anyone trying to keep up to date with the clone wars 
 Lots of sound advices, and useful things for any speaker, and this should help novice and veterans. Cover the mind-mapping useful technique 
 We have used more expensive "professional" grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the Integrity compares for a home version.  Assembly and operation are easy, the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable, allowing conversation or TV viewing with only moderate volume increases 
 This has to be the best recording that AKUS has done to date. Lyrics, music, bluegrass, country, rock.... it doesn't matter.. this is a CD from the heart...This is the type of music that touches one's heart and soul, and makes one's self better for the touch. 
 Machiavelli's "The Art of War" is only half the story.  To fully understand the point and purpose of these conversations, you must read Machiavelli's other and more important book: "The Prince".  Both books are exercises in the logic extending from the premise that the ends justify the means.  You should either obtain both books or the new volume: "The Art of War & The Prince by Machiavelli - Special Edition" which combines both books into one.  Both books are important in the history of philosophy, logic, politics and strategy.  Reading both helps put them in their proper context.  Machiavelli's vision was always clear that success is all that is important.  His detailed insights on the methods and means for achieving success, however clever and convoluted, were always right to the main point:  To the victor there is fame and glory and to the loser there is humiliation and oblivion 
 The book is written in the first person voice, half as a fourteen year old girl trying to cheer up her widowed mother, and half as an old man whose only wish is to communicate with his son before death. These two characters are in no sense related. The two do not know of each other; in fact their lives could not be further apart. The only thing they share in common is a book titled the History of Love. To Alma (the 14 year old) the book is the link between his mother and deceased father. To Leo (the old man), the book was once a dedication to his first love.  The way the author brings these two characters alive, and the way she brings them ultimately together is nothing short from surprising. After starting reading, I never once lost interest in following the narrative. I enjoyed watching (reading) Alma maturing, as well as watching Leo grow wiser. I found both of their voices genuine, and pursuance of their respective quests heart-warming.  Upon finishing the book's last chapter I felt like lending a hand to help heal the two 
 T. S. Eliot, the illustrious American 20th century poet, was - like every great poet - also an extraordinary philosophical person. Unlike some other poets he was not only interested in philosophical questions, but also very knowledgeable about  philosophical matters and the history of philosophy. M. Jain's very informative book describes how T. S. Eliot got the foundations of his philosophical erudition and what the main themes of his thinking were. Eliot's primary influences were the philosophers of German idealism and thinkers like George Santayana and especially F. H. Bradley, about whom he wrote his dissertation. T. S. Eliot became growingly skeptical about philosophy and preferred to be a poet rather than a philosopher, although his Harvard teachers seemed to be sure that he had the ability to become an important philosopher. Manju Jain's work is an important book for all those who are interested in Eliot's biography as well as for those who want to understand the philosophical background of his poems and essays.       
 it analyses the human species from a zoological point of view and provides hypotheses of how it has evolved.  i enjoed it a lot.  
 This book was very interesting to read, a litle bit like reading a novel about how you could become very happy and successful using a variety of new techniques coming straight from the information age we live in.  Most of these techniques did not exist ten years ago, so this is new content.   However, don't think you can learn and master all these topics just by reading this book. It will take time.  Over the past two years, I have been myself following many of his advices and have indeed increased substantially my income and quality of life using the multiple streams of income approach, but also by paying more attention to my own objectives in life and for my professional life.   This book is a good way to learn a litle bit about each main inceom sources (income streams)that are proposed.  From there, you can see which one would fit your style better, and then learn more using more specialized books or courses and give it a try.  Realize that each of these topics could take you a year or more to learn about and develop.  I myself have worked on the basic investing through mutual funds using best funds with 15 years returns of 15% or more, and these funds gave me a return of 20%-40% last year.  I also have started a business to write-off many of my business expenses and started working as a consultant instead of an employee, which allowed me to negotiate a much better rate.  My independance and time flexibility has also improved dramatically, and I can now spend more time exercising, enjoying life with my family and travelling.  I have also worked on investing in options, but did not get better results than mutual funds, and the volatility was too high for my liking (winning 50% one month, loosing 50% the next..)  I decided to stick to mutual funds and index funds.  I have also started writing a book about achieving more success,  and this should start providing some income in another 6 to 12 months.  Overall, very good book but don't underestimate the Planning and focused time and dedication it takes to reach you goals.  However, it is worth it as you reach them one by one!  
 When the Corr siblings first began their "Talk on Corners" world tour in 1998, they were still relatively obscure, selling well in their native Ireland but not so well worldwide. Over the next sixteen months, the band shot up the charts with five hit singles and soldout shows the world over. By the time they returned home in July 1999, they had become one of the best-selling groups in Europe, and their concert at Dublin's Lansdowne Road Stadium proved it by becoming the show to top them all.  With over 40,000 fans in attendance, the quartet took the stage armed with recent hits and Irish charm, and the audience eagerly ate it up. The Lansdowne Road concert has since reached near-legend proportions among Corrs fans, and the DVD capturing it all has recently been released to North American viewers.  It's a roller-coaster ride from the get-go, with the show starting backstage, watching the band settle their nerves while getting ready to perform. From the opening note of 'Only When I Sleep' to the closing strain of 'Toss the Feathers', the show is one hit after another, spurred on by an enthusiastic audience that sang along ('Runaway'), danced along ('Haste to the Wedding'), and weren't afriad to participate fully in the music ('So Young').   In addition to the historic concert, this DVD has several "extras" that can't be found anywhere else. Since it was originally released in Europe just before the 'In Blue' album's debut in 2000, the DVD features a "preview" of three songs off the album (including worldwide smash hit 'Breathless') taken from the 2000 Fleadh festival, as well as interview/behind-the-scenes into the making of the album itself. It's a real treat for true fans of the band to see a bit of the studio work that goes into an album.  I have only two complaints about the DVD: first, there are some awkward cuts between songs, as, for some unknown reason, some of the tunes played at the show didn't make it onto the DVD. The only other complaint I have is that it took nearly four years to get this concert released in the U.S.  Looking for an exciting concert that will have your heart racing and have you eagerly participating from your living room? Look no further. It's family friendly, exciting, and an adrenaline-filled two hours of good music, good stories, and good fun. 
 Wow I couldnt put the book down, this is one of the best Buffy books written so far. The story line is amazing 
 Time passes, but Paolo Freire's ideas are still basic in development work 
 Instead of typing out a contrite or, worse, convoluted summary of this work of art - because that is what this amazing novel is-, it would be better for me to say what it is about this (I'll admit) very long novel:  1- It is full  of lessons of spirituality, some truths and some exaggerations of Christianity, and many historical facts about the ancient Celtic religions.  2- You will grow to have some type of feelings for each and every character. Contrary to the opinion of another reviewer, I do not think it was difficult to keep up with names and relationships at all. The character development is exquisite.  3- The plot is so grippingly interesting that you won't want to put this down!  4- The perspective is a fresh take on the traditional Arthurian stories, with female characters in the forefront.  5- This was a very modern-minded writer! I personally  believe she must have been a feminist, because this book is quite empowering to women. Also, there is much to learn from the lessons that different characters are presented with throughout the book.   In short, this novel was NOTHING SHORT of AMAZING! It made me cry, laugh, sit on the edge of my seat, and -most of all- wish I was living in the story!  Happy Reading 
 Great read. Very propulsive - and immersive, despite having been written via ghost-writer. Excellent insights into the Israel-Palestine quagmire, and great stories about how great counterterrorism is executed.  Also, for what it's worth, if you've seen the movie 'Munich', read this book.  If you haven't seen the movie - don't - and read this book.  If you've read the book and haven't seen the movie, don't.  I can't fathom what Spielberg was thinking when he directed this, but I really feel that he sapped the life out of the book while trying to amplify the drama that the Mossad agents went through.  
 Wow! So glad to a see a fresh new voice from a real storyteller. Dyson combines mystery, suspense and romance and even a good dose of humor for a real page-turner. I planned to liesurely work my way through the story and ended up finishing it overnight! Her characters, from the hard-nosed detective, and victimized mother, to the tantilizing psychic immediately grab you. On top of it all, Dyson tackles the question, "Why do bad things happen to good people." The story is immensely satisfying by the time you've turned the last page. I can't wait for the sequel. You'll want to curl up in your favorite chair and totally enjoy this book, but beware--if you read it in bed late at night, you might find yourself hearing strange noises and having to get up to check for intruders. You'll find yourself involved with the characters from page one 
 This book is not rubbish.  Yes it is slightly propagandistic on the part of "socialism" (though I agree with the views of a previous reviewer), though if you'd seen this type of poverty and social immobility in a FIRST WORLD COUNTRY you'd want to do the same thing. If you read this book and come out with the view that "they should have worked harder", then I believe you are only accepting the view that these people projected onto you. THEY believe they won't make it, so they don't do any work.  Also to these Calvinists, maybe you'd like to do a little research of your own into the US education system, especially concentrating on the amount spent on these individuals.  They say segregation is dead in the US, it's just gone underground (I'm including "involuntary minorities" eg the Hallway Hangers) 
 Another very funny movie with Sandra Bullock! In rehab, Gwennie finds friends, and oddball romance. Favorite part when she gets a diamond 
 Set in medieval France, this is one of the novels in which the characters are full blooded and eternal, faulted and fundamentally good. The characters that alternate in carrying the narrative are the main ones and surprisingly through their own eyes you get a pretty good picture of their own souls.  I always felt that in older times, people had a different code of living and that it is not possible to subject the people who lived then to the standards that apply now - or are there any standards now at all? - and reading this book, I felt that it was not written with that mindset either. I love period pieces that stay true to them. And this is my read of any of Joanne Harris's work. Is it sufficient to say that I really enjoyed it a lot and am looking forward to read more? 
 I have read a few reviews on here by people I feel did not actually purchase this book and were pre-judging it based on part of the pagan communities views towards SRW.  I will agree that many of her books seem to be on the "fluffy" side, especially anything with "Teen" in the title.  Here first series of books were very useful to those just starting out in Wicca or Witchcraft.  She then submitted some books on the market, which I would not offer up to someone starting in the Craft.  However, this book I believe brought her redemption.  If you are not willing to do some studying then this book is not for you.  (That is why I feel she got some bad reviews on it.)  She covers many aspects of Wicca, Witchcraft, Spirituality, and Magic(k).  If you read the book from start to finish then I think you will have a good base to begin your practices and seek out new information.  When you read it, it does seem directed towards teens yet she throws some adult things in as well.  In the back there are spells she offers up for suggestions, however throughout the entire book she insists spells written you write for yourself are more effective.  She also gives the complete guidelines for spells, ritual, and the purposes behind each part, such as why and how to cast a circle, call the quarters, recite the Charge of the Goddess.  There are two things in the book I do not enjoy.  The first is that everything is from a very feminine point of view.  I am not saying it is Dianic but she briefly mentions the God.  The second, is that she is clearly influenced by Dutch Folk Magic(k) and I am more interested in other things.  For both of these things I could go buy separate books.  I think this book is a great starting place for someone interested in Wicca, as long as you pay head and know that her advice does not mean it is Wiccan Law. 
 I absolutely loved this novel! The timeliness of the reality-based plot in the framework of an epic that spans the globe made for a lot of reading enjoyment. I usually don't get an opportunity to read until we put the kids to sleep and by then I'm usually too tired. I got a copy of this book just before a two week vacation and had a hard time putting it down long enough to enjoy my trip. I found myself eager with anticipation for the chance to crawl beneath the covers each night and return to the captivating Winter in Kandahar story.   The novel begins a short time prior to September 11, 2001 in the northeast corner of Afghanistan where the Northern Alliance remains precariously in control of territory that includes the Panjshir Valley where the Alliance Mujaheddin are making what appears to be their last stand against the combined forces of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The main character of the novel, young ill-fated fighter Ahmed Jan, is on the front lines of the see-saw battles that have seen his entire family wiped out. As shaky as the Northern Alliance situation is, it's made all the worse by the assassination of revered Northern Alliance leader Commander Ahmed Massoud at the hands of al- Qaeda in chapter 2. Ironically, in this their darkest hour, the Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington D.C. turn out to be salvation for the Tajik, Uzbek and other groups of the Northern Alliance who are resisting the cruel Taliban domination. Within weeks, U.S. Special Forces, Air Force, Navy, and other military units sweep the Taliban out of Kabul, Taloqan, Kandahar, and other major cities of Afghanistan and put them on the run, along with their al-Qaeda guests, into the Pakistani tribal territories along the Afghan border. Ahmed Jan finds a mysterious communiquï¿½ in the coat of an al-Qaeda messenger and, along with ruthless Mujaheddin fighter Mustafa and old, rigid holy man Mohammajon, gets swept into an adventure that spans the globe from Islamabad to Amsterdam to Venice to Seattle to Vancouver to Karachi and back to Kandahar. This engrossing epic story includes CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers interwoven with three love stories with very different endings. The adventure concludes with a movingly heartrending, surprise finale. I must be a romantic at heart too, because I enjoyed the romances. It's hard to believe the previous reviewer was writing about the romance between the Tajik fighter Mustafa and the nurse Fatima in the Pakistani Hospital because it's so central to the plot. I guess she was referring to the pubescent romance between the young American scientist and his student. I guess the author could have omitted it, but I enjoyed it, and it helped to break up what otherwise could have been too heavy.   I highly recommend this book for both women and men who are fans of international thrillers 
 Having enjoyed his music for a few years now I'm so glad to have bought "Inside the Thunder" which ranks already with my all time favourites...right up there alongside Jackson Brown's "Late for the Sky", Joni Mitchells "Blue", Van Morrison's "Moondance" and Beth Orton's "Trailer Park"! The song lyrics are thoughtfully profound and yet beautifully poetic and the arrangement always fits the lyric perfectly...ranging from wonderfully layered rhythmic tracks with atmospheric and accomplished instrumental solos to simple, perfect acoustic guitar with vocal. Dougie MacLean's voice is so distinctive and  positively addictive and this album is the man at his best! 
 At first I thought I had bought a crap kung fu film,however,if you look past the TV soap style picture and sound quality,there lies a really cool kung fu film with a great story and excellent fight scenes masterly crafted by genius Yuen Woo Ping.In fact the film is actually an edited version of the TV series with the same name.I strongly recommend this title to hardcore kung fu film fans. 
 As a medical scientist at Duke University, I would like to commend Dr. Graves on a superb overview of genetic differences between human populations from different parts of the world.  This book makes a very clear statement of what is now mainstream science, though unfortunately it may be difficult to understand for readers without sufficient scientific background.  What makes this book especially remarkable is its expert weaving of a tale involving the history of research in this area with the parallel history of social concepts of race.  Given the importance of its topic in the world today, this book should be more widely publicized 
 This is a good introduction to investing for the person who wants to squirrel money away for retirement and isn't interested in "beating the market." Schulters cautions against managed mutual funds that charge big management fees and against chasing hot Wall Street picks. I found his advice to be sensible, his style likable, and the book overall very readable. I cringed a little when he started talking about his own mountain-climbing experiences, but even those turned out to be not so bad. 
 This book is a linear commentary on the little things in life. Each page and comment has a picture of an animal that adds meaning to the comment -almost always in a make you smile or outright laugh kind of way.  It is a gentle and sensitive light hearted book that everyone will enjoy and gain something from. Of course it doesn't answer the big question, it just gives you food for thought about it.   The only minus about this book is that all the pictures are in black and white. Color would have been so much better.   
 The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of great mystery and fascination. His role in the development of the atomic bomb and his subsequent role in shaping America's nuclear policy, as well as his rise and fall during McCarthy has been the subject of countless books. David Cassidy, Hofstra University professor, has written an excellent account of Oppenheimer's life and the development of theoretical physics in America during the early part of the 20th century. The parallelism between the life of Oppenheimer and the rise of American science is an intriguing tale that is captured in this book.  This biography is a detailed and beautifully written work. Cassidy expands beyond the traditional scope of a biography and expertly explores the surrounding environment that shaped Oppenheimer's life. He draws upon previously untapped primary documents, and shows the importance and character of Oppenheimer's early education on the rest of his life. Cassidy examines the conflicts between Oppenheimer's liberal education from the Ethical Culture School and the culture that he found at Harvard. Oppenheimer's time in Europe is also recounted.  The book does not become overly focused on the Manhattan Project, but covers the time on "The Hill" in enough detail to keep the story in context. He instead offers insights to the periods before the war, when Oppenheimer taught at Berkeley and Cal Tech. Oppenheimer's genius and ability to inspire his students is shown, allowing us to gain insight into the man before the events that would be the foundation of his legacy.  The 1954 Atomic Energy Commission security review that disgraced Oppenheimer, and stripped him of his security clearance for alleged "red ties," are explored with the same thoughtful insight. Recent documents and information regarding those events are thoroughly and conclusively discussed.  Oppenheimer: and the American Century is a welcome addition to the history of science.

 First of all, this is a good game.  I have only played with two teams and I am going to have to say that the estimated time of game play for teams is off.  Whenever I played, it took at least three hours to finish, and less if we decided not to finish.  The hardest part is getting the industry awards.  The game always ended with both teams going for their last award, so that kept it close . . . which is cool, but it is the main reason the game takes so long.  Also, the board design seemed to make it so that we would land on "On the Map" and "Music Mix" more than any other space.  Most of the questions are pretty hard, especially "50's".  It was one of the funniest moments during the game when my opposing team was relieved to know they were to get a Britney Spears question.  The relief turned into frustration when the question asked for one of the producers of her album, and it was not the one that they knew.  It was awesome.  Overall it's a good game.  It just takes a while to finish (especially with the difficulty of the industry awards), I hate landing on the "50's" square, and it seems to get like some bands more than others (like the Band).  Buy it if you really know your music.  Casual listeners don't really help their teams that much 
 This is a beautifully illustrated and translated two-book comic adaption of Wagner's Ring cycle.  P. Craig Russell's defends his belief that he could translate the opera music into images and create a powerful fantasy saga.  The art is fantastic: Russell draws beautiful panels - the covers of these two books are a great example of the art inside.  The translation into English is melodramatic (well, it's opera) and powerful.  I can't praise these books enough.  This is my favorite graphic story since I read, and re-read, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman, and these two volumes will be accompanying me on all my future moves 
 The Folger Shakespeare Library presents the optimal format for reading Shakespeare's single plays.  Each book provides the background and context of the play, a brief description of the theater as Shakespeare would have known it, and a brief bio of the writer himself.  But the most useful feature is the notation on the page facing the text, explaining Shakespeare's usage of words and phrases.  There is a wealth of scholarship embedded in these brief notes.  An experienced reader of Shakespeare may skip them, to maintain the momentum of the play, but even we may tarry to ascertain his ken.    The Tempest is the birthplace of "there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple," "he receives comfort like cold porridge," "what's past is prologue," "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows," "Oh, brave new world*," and "his complexion is perfect gallows."  It is Shakespeare's farewell to London, and it is imaginative and enlightening.  It is also timeless, often giving rise to contemporary settings in its production.  Prospero's supernatural powers, permeating the action of the play, will take an additional effort at the "willing suspension of disbelief" which we always take to the theater.  Yet we are not at all reluctant when, in his epilogue, he boldly asks us to applaud his players.  *  This phrase, "...brave new world..." was penned in 1611, and should not seem so "new" to our modern ears as it does 
 Loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around.  Two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries.  Very funny and moving - yes, I'm a romantic! It's awesome! 
 There probably isn't too much more to say about this book that the good reviews above don't already say, but I had to chime in in agreement. I picked up a paperback of Vampire High off a Halloween table because of the engaging cover, and bought it because of the clever conceit and a brisk first chapter. And I'm so glad I did - I devoured this book in all of a day and a half, and found myself hungry for more when it was finished.  Quoted VOYA comparisons to Rowling and Snicket on the back cover aren't really fair to the individuality of this book. Yes, it has the clever wit of Snicket, though here it is channeled through a likeable teenage protagonist and isn't overdone. Yes, it immerses us in a school for exceptional students - in this case, of course, vampires - down to the odd yet enthusiastic teachers and administrators, but expectations for Cody are certainly not what they are for Harry and the gang over at Hogwarts. Instead, challenged not with being a "chosen one" but a "meaningless one," Cody chooses to rebel - which in this case means doing his best to make the grade.  What I liked most about this book was how it blended a bit of what's being done with contemporary vampire horror fiction by adult authors the likes of Dan Simmons (namely in Children of the Night) and contemporary YA fiction. I cared equally about Cody's relationships with love interest Ileana and new best friend Justin as I did about the tantalizing hints of vampire social structure in America.  This is a well-conceived and entertaining book that should appeal to both boys and girls, and I for one hope there are more books like it to come from Mr. Rees 
 World War II ended fourteen years ago, but London still shows the ruins.  For Russian descendent Chief Superintendent of Scotland Yard Freddie Troy, the conviction of crime kingpin King Alf should be a time of elation.  Instead the war years have returned; his former lover Kitty Stilton is back in town but unavailable since she is married to American presidential hopeful, Calvin Cormack, another person from Freddie's espionage past.  Private investigator Joey Rork is in town to insure that Kitty behaves while in England.  However, while London swings with Kitty as its biggest swinger, a war seems imminent to take over King's Alf's crime syndicate and American gamblers and crooners are in the middle of the action.  When Rork and others are violently killed, Freddie leads the inquiries that take him back to 1944 when he was recovering from a bullet courtesy of his mistress and the antics of his family especially his promiscuous sisters and his brother, who has present day (1959 that is) ambitions.  There is also links to when he was Sergeant Freddie Troy.  Still, in spite of his efforts London with Ike coming is filling up with mutilated corpses.  FLESH WOUNDS is an exhilarating British historical police procedural that binds events and real persona or obviously disguised persona between World War II and 1959.  The story line is overloaded with several subplots that at times may feel overwhelming, but not only come together but enables readers to compare 1944 and 1959 London.  Freddie is terrific in both eras as he is the string that keeps the multitude of subplots tied together.  Fans will appreciate this deep but dark look back to two distinct Great Britain's only fifteen years apart within a fine Noir.  
 This is real, as in no plastic, no sound byte america, in a period of irrelavance.   This is salve.... this is just what you didn't  think existed is just a twisted time. 
 As one who is more interested in the composer than the performer, I am always skeptical when I hear that a performer puts his own spin on a composition.  Such was the case with Glenn Gould -- until I listened to this collection.  It was a pleasant surprise to find that I liked Gould's interpretation of Mozart's sonatas.  He deepens the pathos and remorse of the slow movements, and takes the energy of the fast movements to new heights.  Somehow, Gould managed to "interpret" Mozart without imposing himself too much on the music.  I can't really explain why, but this very conservative Mozart fan is well pleased with Gould's unique performance 
 I have had mine for over 2 1/2 years. Im a painter I work with lots of loud machines all day, from my paint sprayer to the sander. these buds are very good. they are comfortable enough to wear all day I generaly work 8-12 hrs a day and use them for at lest 6-8 hrs. they have one of the best sounds i have had out of a headphone. I bought some boss ear buds a while back and that were over $100.00 but the sound difference was not worth the extra cash i forked out. the long cord can be anoying ive just learned to cary a small ruberband with me and tuck the extra into the pocket with my ipod.and if you wear the headpones with the wire behind your head it dosnt bother you at all. I dont know what people are saying about the wires rubbing and making noise. mine dont. you should buy them. save yourself some cash. 
 This book should be read by everyone on the planet - it is the tool to assist in bringing about the "mind-shift" for our next leap in evolution. Justine 
 How interesting it is to read some history on spirituals I've known all my life, but never understood the "spirits" they came from.  Ms. Warren has opened a door to me and showed me the true beauty of this music.  I am especially grateful to have the scores to each of the songs discussed in this book. I was also pleased to find the contemporary gospel section. This is not a sit down and read cover to cover kind of book, but a page flip to "Oh, yeah, I know this song!" kind of book 
 The book is extremely uneven, sometimes illuminating, sometimes patronising. While the author faithfully tries to illustrate the darker paths of paganism and magic, his repeated attempts to subtly put down any other approach to spirituality grows irritating. In addition, good editing would have improved the book greatly. The poetry, for instance, is autrocious. This is the only book on the topic that I came across, and I cannot recommend it without reservation. Use with a dose of salt only 
 This book was about a boy named Sterling North.Sterling North is also the author of this book.This book was about Sterling finding a raccoon in May.He names the raccoon Rascal.They became very good friends.It was kind of sad at the end though.At the end, Sterling lets Rascal free. Thats what made me sad. I recommend this book four stars 
 This is a great book for both the beginner as well as those who are at the intermediate level of their study of insects. It makes for a good first exposure to the taxonomic key. I professor who I knew  who taught entomology at Loyola University in Chicago had this book as one of the course texts for his students. I am sure he is not alone. Illustrated with both line drawings and photographs it is the standard work on insects of North America 
 Thanks for keeping a Brit sane in a country full of "My wife says..." jokes.  Your wife is fat and ugly and I don't care what she says. Because she's ugly. And fat...  ..and not my wife 
 No, you can't RECORD with Reason. But there are countless ways to use files that you have recorded with other, very simple or even free applications (how about your Sony Minidisk recorder hooked up to a decent mike? talk about light years ahead of what we had available way back when); files that you have downloaded, files that you have gotten off of records or CD's or even TV, in Reason (shame!). It can be as simple as having the drum machine play a sound file from anywhere on your computer, with a surprising amount of control of, for example, sample start-and then you move on to the more powerful samplers... And then this will provide you with many different ways to control and distort, filter, and manipulate those files that are so easy to trigger or otherwise get inside Reason. Because that is what Reason does, it gives you a studio full of tools-synths, samplers, mixers, and the many sound sculpting modifiers to create, twist, and control your sounds.  And this book does a fantastic job of showing you these tools, in a very carefully thought out order and depth. Like another reviewer said, you would have to be a serious power user indeed not to get many good ideas from this book; and like yet another reviewer said, people that write textbooks should look at this one and see just how well it can be done. It will take you from a novice to synthesizers to an expert on Reason and computer synthesis music creation, giving history and background to help you learn about the many music synthesis tools. It is filled with tutorials, how-to's, and tips and tricks that even go beyond Reason sometimes. You could take a tutorial and change it as you follow along and create it and have a complete Reason song of your own easily. I also thought it gave a summarily good introduction into the powerful usage of the Control Voltage interface from ages past (one of Reason's most powerful tools in it's bag of tricks-one that ties everything together like you have never been able to do with so many different devices), with tips and tricks there, too. There are a lot of toys available in Reason, but once you get past a certain not-too-difficult level, it is actually a very intuitive and very fun to use interface; and this book is definitely filled with this same infectious enthusiasm for that rack o' modules and wires. It is an extraordinarily good book for beginner to expert.  You should see my copy of this book, it is nearly destroyed from so much usage, carrying it about wherever I go and constantly going back to it for reference.  As a side note, I think the Acrobat Reader Operation Manual supplied with Reason is also excellent. It's just what it should be-precise and to the point-it's an Operation Manual, after all. If you take the time to practise and apply what you read, it will give you the background to know what you are doing (as much as is possible-sometimes when you have so much going on in a patch it would be hard for anyone to say how you got there-and that can be fun, too) and what every control does. This book will do the same and take you farther with much more help 
 This music is great.  I got into this band directly after my Allele phase.  I still like both bands a lot though my mood will depend on which I want to mellow out to 
  The author brings to light some of the difficulty in reaching an audience of reluctant students, and how hard it is for teachers to motivate and educate our charges. He does so in an entertaining manner by mixing stories of his successes and failures in the classroom along with anecdotes of his life.  No teacher should be without the insights that McCourt offers. This non-fiction work weaves his tragic childhood into his career as a high school and college English teacher. The best stories are the true ones, and McCourt's is the best I have read in a long time. For other real live stories I suggest the book "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" 
 Keeping the Moon By Sarah Dessen  Keeping the Moon or Losing Your Soul  Have you ever felt out of place because of your culture, clothing style, or simply just your backround? In the Novel, Keeping the Moon y Sarah Dessen, Colie did not fit in her school, because she was fat. Sometimes, the first instinct to not fitting in is so make yourself blend in better, but that was not Colie's case... until her mom became a fitness instructor and forced Colie to become in shape, 	Dessen creates such surreal and relatable scenes, that the book seems to fly by before you know it. Each page consists of drama, which keeps the reader on its feet at all times. The plot tells about Colie's life-changing summer, and how her personality is shaped by other main characters in the book, such as Norman, Morgan, and Isabel. At the beginning, they were on list of Colie's bad side, but throughout the booktheey have a lot in common. Colie realizes, sometimes, you need to change, not to please others, but mainly to please yourself. 	The author uses first person narrative, which really gives the reader the true personality of Colie, not from another person's point of view. It also shows Colie's improvement in her attitude towards new things.  	Reading this book, gives you not only an amazing take on real-life drama, but also shows you a point of view of someone originally did not fit in, but by the end of two months is very social. If you have read the quick read, This Lullaby, also by Sarah Dessen, and enjoyed it, you are very likely to find this book to be fantastic. You will not believe Colie's transformation that occurs between page 1 and page 228. 
 What a joy it was to read this book, and another of Fischer's books; Paul Revere's Ride. Written in narrative storytelling fashion, the book moves briskly--but with urgency. I will save the long reviews for the top 500 writers here at Amazon, but I found this book to be extremely satisfying.  What's more, not only does Fischer illuminate Washington's determination to keep the idea of liberty alive, he also writes about the tremendous help given the Continental Army by locals who continued to harass the British throughout the winter as British foraging parties searched for food for themselves and their horses. 
 This is really an incredible album. I always give credit where credit is due. As in when I used to look at Prince and, with my Jazz and Classically trained musical snobbery, say "How ridiculous..", but then, with age - (and a certain amount of humility) - I came to discover that the man truly knows his music, his style, his performing strengths.  Same goes here for Sheryl Crow. She really puts it out in this album, and she seems to know how - in a strong and confident way.  Thoroughly enjoyable... - which is why I can't understnad the Amazon.com's reviewer's comments.  -  WAY off base if you ask me.  He must've not been looked at by Sheryl the way he REALLY wanted to be looked at by Sheryl - while attending a Live concert of hers once... Maybe.  His (or her) sophomoric & [what seem to be] personally motivated comments aside, I'd highly recommend this album 
 After the last year of telling all of my friends about Cathi Hanauer's The Bitch in the House, I'm now delighted to have discovered yet another provocative book (albeit a little late) about the current generation of women and the difficult choices we are making regarding work and family.  What an emotional ride! I couldn't put it down.   Orenstein managed to touch upon all the contradictions that highly-educated career women face in this "postfeminist" moment without oversimplifying our decisionmaking.  Like some of the other reviewers, I did recommend this book to my husband as it is a testament to the struggles we face.  But if you are looking for easy answers, this isn't the book.  If you are looking for a narrative that will give you some insight as to how other women are carving out lifestyles that, although less than perfect, are fulfilling and even joyful then this book is for you 
 Many readers have commented on the book's 'magical' writing style which creates an excitement and wonderment that just draws you in and doesn't let go.  The thing I like most about this book as an elementary school teacher is that the book is so versatile and so accessible to so many readers.  As a read-aloud, small-group literature circle, read with a parent or partner, or read independently, this book fits any situation.  Because of the short chapters, the large print, the extremely interesting stories told within the novel, and the fluent writing style, virtually any reader right from emergent young chapter book reader to struggling upper elementary reader right up to adult will fall in love with this book.  If you have a child who doesn't like reading, get this book for them.  It just might turn them on to reading 
 SEAL Team 16 is called upon once again, this time to take down a group of terrorists who have hijacked a commercial airplane and forced it to land in Kazbekistan, they are charged with the rescue of 120 passengers on-board. Joining the SEAL team is FBI hostage negotiator Max Bhaghat, agents Jules Cassidy and Alyssa Locke, and Reserve chopper pilot Teri Howe.   Three romantic threads intertwine in this romantic thriller: a wistful WWII romance recalled by a Holocaust survivor; a turbulent relationship between SEAL Lt. Sam Starrett and FBI sharpshooter, Alyssa Locke; and a burgeoning romance between the team's Senior Chief Stanley Wolchonok and helicopter pilot Teri Howe.  When Teri Howe, one of the best helicopter pilots in the Naval Reserves, asks Stan to help her keep a harassing officer at bay, his instincts scream to comfort her and crush the offender. To put her out of reach of the officer, Stan arranges for her to accompany his team on a training op that quickly turns into a real-life rescue mission. Teri doesn't mind being in the middle of the action, and she's eager to spend time with the fierce but compassionate Senior Chief.  Teri Howe is the pursuer, while Stan tries to steer clear of the whole "enlisted verses officer" fraternization rule. Each step Stan tries to take away from her, setting her up with Mike Muldoon, she takes two steps forward. It is nice to see the least outwardly romantic of SEAL Team 16 show his softer side.   Steamy love scenes are perfectly and tastefully executed.   Meanwhile, Lt. Sam Starrett struggles to earn FBI sharpshooter, Alyssa Locke's trust.  Max Bhaghat, FBI negotiator, endeavors to keep his dealings with American hostage, Gina Vittagliano, from becoming too personal; as the SEALs prepare to take out the terrorists.  Over The Edge is fraught with so much tension and a harrowing assault of one of the passengers, that the team is forced to listen to in horror). Negotiator Max wrestles with his growing feelings for the hostage, and his inability to save her in time.  I was hooked from the beginning, and enjoyed the story within the story and WWII background.  Taut suspense, witty dialogue and dashes of humor help maintain the novel's swift pacing, and Brockmann has a way of making characters come to life and feel like tangible people you come to care about.  She is able to maintain a flow of storyline that knits all of these different pieces together and simply leaves you feeling like you know these people well. 4 1/2 Star 
 Being a huge fan of this director, it's no surprise I recommend the film ... but only if you can tolerate extremely challenging cinema.  If you like films that make you feel happy about being alive, this isn't for you.  If you like films that don't make you think, this isn't for you.  Much has been and will be written of the film's violence and rape scene.  Less will be written about the ways the director makes you feel uncomfortable (sound, camera work and lighting effects).  Trust me, it all works, and if you have a good sound system or are prone to seizures you may just want to stay away from this one.  Noe likes dealing with mass manipulation through things like film, and this movie is no exception.  Its violence and rape scene don't make this an effective film, however.  It's what leads up to it (in reverse order, of course.)  Naysayers will easily dismiss this film as vile, and they are right.  But it is also honest and unafraid.  To dismiss it without seeing it, however, shows how little some people know.  You can't help but be moved by what Noe is doing, and he isn't trying to move you in a positive way.  He's making a statement, and it's a statement that says revenge is hideous and sometimes necessary; that men are beasts (and that's sometimes a saving grace); and that people don't make the most of the time they are given.  Vile?  Maybe so.  But so is ignorance 
 A knowledgeable and enthusiasic treatise on folding kayaks, their varieites, history, and use.  Useful for the would-be purchaser, the novice, and the experience paddler alike 
 John Campbell was a lot more than just a blues musician, he was a locomotive spirit who was bound to jump the tracks.  He recorded more than the 3 albums currently available, but whether masters still exist is questionable.  He was a major  influence and mentor to a younger Papa Mali (Malcolm Welbourne) and a mystical practitioner eulogized by Dr. John at a biker funeral.  Howling Mercy is certainly his best completed work before his death and points clearly to his destiny.  This is sinewy texas blues served on the edge of a sharp blade 
 The detailed instructions on each exercise are extremely helpful for those of us who are "word" people, but it is probably most useful as an accompaniment to a video or to working with a certified instructor in a studio.  I am doing both of those and found this helpful, but if one were clueless you might not "get it" just from the book.    By the way, one reviewer asked why the exercises aren't listed separately by level of skill required.  The answer is that in the Pilates method the sequence of exercises is considered extremely important AND when you are more advanced you continue to do the more basic exercises (sometimes with more difficult positioning of legs, arms or body.)    
 Because of Shakespeare, I am Advanced Placement Literature.  I have read all his works and enjoyed them thoroughly.  This Bio of him, as with all the others on A&E, is wonderful.  He is the best playwrite of the 17th  century 
 I`ve bought this today... And I`m not happy about that! It`s a shame that I didn`t buy it that very first moment I saw it in the store! This is beautiful piece of music. Beautiful... If you like Live/Dead you gonna like this one. I`m not gonna write comments about versions of songs here and there... They`re different and that`s good. Enjoy.. 
 This is one of the most clever, metaphorical, and stunning movies ever made. I have not seen many other films that are this flawless. Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, and Lauren Bacall are all perfectly cast - Robert Stack in particular is very effective (and believable) as this spoiled son of a texas oil hancho who turns to alcohol for his failed personal relationships (impotence). If you are a fan of Fassbinder, Almodovar, or John Waters you know just how inspirational Douglas Sirk's film is - truly a masterpiece 
 Listening to this album makes me realize how much I missed Pack's singular songwriting and singing voice.  These are wonderful and professionally excecuted adult contemporary songs that have that trademark Pack touch:  terrific harmonies, stellar musicianship, and a subtle warmth that sticks with you and grows deep inside.  This is an album of collaborations, and they work very well.  The opening track with Ann Wilson is terrific and sets a great mood.  "Vertical Disbelief" is quite nice.  And the two Ambrosia remakes (Biggest Part of Me and You're the Only Woman) are tasteful and mature updates that furnish new interpretive subleties while retaining the sweetness of the originals.   I definitely want more 
 Henry Mayhew, founder of Punch magazine, wrote this four-volume  sociological classic during the 1850's.  If you are at all interested in  the Victorian era, in British history, in London, or in urban history in  general, this is a must-read.  The Penguin version is abridged and is a  distillation of the "best" of the multiple-volume set.  This  distillation is itself over 500 pages, so imagine the impact of the entire  set!  The utter destitution of the London poor is set out in such vivid  detail than one cannot help being shocked at the conditions human beings  were forced to live in in the greatest city of its time.  The only fault I  find with this book is Mayhew's occasional lapses into preaching.   Otherwise a fine boo 
 I couldn't put it down--which is often said of a novel, but maybe not so often about a professional book.  I truly read the book for six hours, and only took a few breaks.  I started out highlighting what I found provocative, but soon realized that that wasn't enough.  I got out my post-its, and began to note bits of wisdom I didn't want to forget.  I think I must have added 50 post-its!!  It's not that the information is so new, but rather that it is such a reminder and "emphasizer" about how we talk to children, and treat them in our classrooms.   I thank Mr. Johnston for his thoughtful approach, and love the organization of the book.  I've shared bits and pieces of what I've read with the staff at my school, and plan to continue to do so for the rest of the year.  I've ordered two more copies of the book to share with colleagues.  Thank you for this inspiring book 
 I bought this book because I had an assignment at work that required me to learn every possible thing about lithium ion batteries. I consulted general interest encyclopedias, battery experts at universities, and various online sources, but none of the above provided the comprehensive, unbiased information that Handbook of Batteries promised. It includes useful comparison charts and historical information about the development of single-use and secondary batteries, from the clunky short-lived lead-acid battery of the 1800s to the fuel cells of today. The language is surprisingly easy to understand for the lay person.   The downsides are that it weighs a ton and that the pages are so dense that you might as well be reading a dictionary cover to cover--a dictionary that's all about batteries. 
 Dear Alfred Slote, I really loved The Trading Game! It is such a great book.I hope there is a sequel. This book has descriptive sentences and a good moment of feeling. I think you are a great writer. This is the first book that I have read from you and loved it. I am glad you have wrote this book. I hope to read more of your books From, Karin 
 Too many people judge books based on an author's previous and best works, when they should be judged on on each book as its own entity. If one does this than "the Broker" qualifies as an entertaining read, full of intrigue, great backdrop, likeable protagonist, and just a plain old fun read. Will it pose moral questions after finished?  No, but it will give you pleasure for enjoying a story with an interesting plot, characters, and a satisfying ending, and that is what matters the most in the end 
 For Love is a subdued, mature chronicle of a woman coming to terms with adult relationships. This book tells the story of Lottie, a woman haunted by her and her new husband's pasts. The tone is detached with the author perhaps purposefully distancing the readers from intense emotion. Themes in the book include love (of course) both romantic and familial, identity, loyalty, maturation, and conscious living. It is not a tale packed with action-- though it decidedly lures us with a "what will ever happen?" plot thread. Sue Miller nimbly and impressively weaves the plot back and forth through time and through the emotional state of the protaganist (Lottie). It is a first person account told in third person (hence the distancing). This device may be used to emulate the lack of connection and knowledge Lottie has with and of herself. This book presents the simple unfolding of a story completed with brilliant technique and subtlety. Would I recommend this book? Yes. It contains simple life truths which provoke soul searching and contemplation. To whom would I recommend it? Patient readers. Those willing to take the time to meander with the author and the protangonist through the often stream of consciousness narration. Was this book life changing for me? Yes. It helped me wrap my mind around two ideas that while very intuitive seemed very fresh and enrichming for me: 1) When we love people, that love will either stretch to include all different versions of them as they grow and change, or it won't... lasting love takes work in that regard. How is this work done? This leads me to idea # 2) Sometimes we have to pretend to love the changed version of a person we once loved (or pretend to embrace the true nature person who we idealized as something else) until that love can adapt and become a reality. Will this book change the way I live? It will change my perspective. If the book's philosophy is correct and thought follow actions... then yes... it will have changed my life. I enjoyed this book for it's unlikely marriage of depth and simplicity 
 Bob Dylan's music reflected an entire generation's hopes and dreams and he's received extensive treatment in coverages which continue to this day, but Mojo's survey in Dylan: Visions, Portraits, And Back Pages is something different: a collection of powerful writings from the world's best rock journalists from Mojo magazine who work together to provide a comprehensive set of insights on his life. Stories behind songs and albums pair with previously unseen photos to shed new light on his personality and music. The vintage photos and stories are outstanding presentations, packed with color and life. 
 This is a great book for little kids... however its a little complex for a child under 2.  Will be great when my child is a little older 
 As someone who always says I am looking for the Meaning of Life, this title caught my eye (even though I didn't think it actually contained the answer).  It does tell you that you need to find your own meaning (guess I knew that) but the quotes are SO true and the pictures SO cute, I thoroughly enjoyed them and they give me the message that I am on the right path.  I look forward to the day when "I'll be excited about beginning another day and be filled with heartfelt joy."  Sounds great to me!  I you are interested in this topic I would highly recommend  Finding Your Own North Star: Claiming the Life You Were Meant to Live by MARTHA BECK.    Good Luck on your search.    
 When it comes to women H. Rider Haggard has the inside track as revealed in this "Show and tell" novel. We see the workings and wonders of the nineteenth century mind. You may also find some interesting attitudes towards the other people in Holly's crew.  I have read some different versions of the book and found the Barns & Noble books New York (ISBN 0760752400) to have the best introduction (by Clifton Ganyard) that falls just short of Cliff's Notes in explaining Haggard's background and writings. The illustrations are the same as in the Modern Library version but are clearer and larger. You get to see the writing on a potshard that I have not taken the time to see if it is a real language. Of all the versions I prefer most the recording with narrator Fred Williams; at first he seems to be monotone and out of breath. Then as he approaches the adventure he picks up a bit. By the time he comes to the cliff hanger he is huffing and puffing. He actually has the sound and feel of some old person recalling a long past adventure.  Holly is visited by his dying friend in the middle of the night. He is sworn to secrecy and given a mysterious chest to hold onto and asked to take charge of the friend's son (Leo). When the time came to open the chest and find the contents, the adventure began. I will not relate the story as it is the unfolding that is a good part of the mystery. However if you are expecting an adventure story It is there but there is much more with philosophical discussions of science and society.  The story is over way too soon so be sure to get the next book " Ayesha: The return of She."   
 I remember many of the examples in this book that created good and positive change. How just one small act makes a difference. Malcolm Gladwell offers simple and effective examples of how others have made a difference, and how you and I can too.   I enjoyed reading this book and think it brings good solutions to people just at a time in our world when we could all really use them. This is a book I would suggest for anyone who would like to revive a spark inside to make a difference! 
 This book is written to address directly the kinds of procedures that photographers want to know about Photoshop. Instead of looking at Photoshop from a programmer's perspective (i.e. here are all of the cool things the crop tool can do) Kelby approaches Photoshop from the other side, in a humorous and simple style that starts with what the PHOTOGRAPHER wants to do and then tells you which tools to use and how. If you are looking for a manual that lets you quickly and simply do what you want, get this. By the way, many of the techniques will work with Photoshop Elements. In other words, for under a hundred bucks you can buy this book and Photoshop Elements and do some fantastic things to your photographs. Great book 
 Does this one still even pop up on TV?  If not it should because after the classic Christmas and Halloween Peanuts specials this one is the next based.  Made in 1974 it has every bit of the charm and laughs as those other specials and it's too bad that it doesn't get more notoriety.  They really do not make them like this anymore.  This special is much like "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" in that we again have the ever hopeful Linus, trying to convince the rest of the gang that the Easter Beagle will arrive on Easter Morning to give eggs the kids.  None of the gang are buying it however and they are all off having their own problems.  Peppermint Patty is trying to teach Marcie to color eggs, much to Patty's frustration, Sally has to get some new shoes at the mall, Snoopy wants to get a new bird cage for Woodstock, and Charlie Brown is discouraged to see the stores already advertising for Christmas at Easter time.  This DVD comes with a bonus Peanuts special, "It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown".  I guess they were pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel when they made this one in 1976.  It's not bad mind you, but who celebrates Arbor Day?  While researching a report on Arbor Day, Sally enlists the gang to turn Charlie Brown's ball field into a garden and orchard, complete with a tree on the pitcher's mound and scarecrow in the outfield.   Good Peanuts fun! 
 My 4-year old son loves watching this movie with his Dad.  This movie is heaven for boys of all ages.  Space ships and all-American heroes.  What can be more fascinating?  And the sound track is very upbeat and romantic at the same time.  My "boys" keep humming the melody 
 After devouring "The Good Earth," I was dying to read more and see where Pearl Buck would go next with this dynamic family.  I found that "Sons" was a good read, but a little slower and not as exciting and thrilling.  But true to the original, right as I starting losing just a little bit of interest she would introduce a new twist or turn which made me always come back for more.  She is an amazing writer and her insights into the culture are always fascinating.  If you really liked The Good Earth, Sons will probably be a fun, quick read, but I don't feel that it is as vital of a work as The Good Earth.  
 This story is about a ten year old girl and her parents who go on a trip from Virginia to the deep woods of Michigan in a wagon going nearly 2mph. On their trip they meet a Native American tribe and in that tribe there is a Native American girl and her name is Taw cum ego qua. This book is special because it takes place in 1837. This book is worth reading because it has good descriptions throughout the book. -Nicolas, Second Grade, 05-0

 Mckee after left Lone Justice,(80s Mtvs favorites) wanted to lead her music to a new level, she had folk , southern and country influences she wanted to capture in a studio , so with the help of Justices former keyboardist Mr. Brody and Don Was in production she started with her Van Morrison favorite tunes and musical references as well Tom Petty teachings and some of his musicians too, the result is an album with all the melancholly of southern, the beauty of the depressing lyrics in some tracks and the emotion of love , lost love and hope of love, life, childhood memories and even some sense humor for a broken heart such as in "only once" , only a few girls have followed the path that country southern and blues legends (cash, Petty etc.) started and Maria Mckee is one of them "You Gotta Sin to Get Saved" is one of the highest points in her career same as in "Life is sweet"   HM          
 I have 7 or 8 McCoy Tyner CDs.  This one is my favorite 
 I bought this soundtrack because I love the movie.  And if you love the movie, a big part of the movie is the music.  This soundtrack is everything it should be.  It preserves the music exactly the way it is presented in the movie.  An added bonus to this CD is the fact that they did something that is rarely done on soundtracks: they put the songs in order.  You can pop this CD in and relive the movie without one visual aid--very touching.  The Sound of Music (1965 Film Soundtrack - 40th Anniversary Special Edition) is exactly what you're looking for in a soundtrack to capture what you love and remember about one of the greatest films of all time 
 Mapping the Terrain is a wonderful resource for individuals who have difficulty staying in a relationship.  It looks at the six capacities of loving; erotic involvement, merging, idealization, integration, refinding,  and self-transcendence.  This book will help you to identify the barriers  to maintaining a relationship, why this happens, and what you can do about  it.  A great resource for individuals who fall in love but struggle to stay  in love 
 One of the great coming of age stories ever written. More of man's than a woman's book. Any boy who has ever experienced pain or disillusionment or longing for something more vis-à-vis his relationship with his father will appreciate this book. Funny. Sad. Painful. Insightful. Completely relatable. This book gets inside your soul and ages extremely well in the memory 
 I will admit, there is some very good stuff on this CD. Most of them are anime tracks, but they're quality is first rate. Some of these tracks though, are not exactly what I'd call good listening. If you haven't seen the anime involved and already heard these songs a million times, BUY IT. I promise it won't let you down. And, I mean, it's got HYDE on it. You really can't go wrong. But if you have heard most of these songs before, the extras thrown in there seem to bring it down ever-so-slightly. Excellent for people looking for something new to listen to, bad for those who have heard it all before 
 These are the best because all other silicones are not flexiable...these wrap right around handles...I intend to order several more sets for xmas gifts 
 I am an unabashed  admirer of Howard Zinn, but I am tremendously impressed with Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation.             
 Let me begin by stating that this is one of the funniest travel books I have ever read. Also let me say that this is one of the most useful travel books I have ever read. Forget Lonely Planet and Rough Guide, go straight for this classic and then talk your way around Rio in confident Carioca slang. True, this book is not going to tell you anything about Sugar Loaf, or where to find a cheap hostel and place to eat, but it is going to give you the tools to go out there and strike up a conversation with the locals.   While in some cases the book seems a little out-dated (it was published in 1991 when inflation of the now defunct Cruzeiro could easy run at 1000% per year), that is only a minor distraction from the wealth of knowledge available on almost every page. From explanations of how to spend your day at the beach like a Carioca (rather than as a gringo or Paulistano), to tips on how to meet new friends at the local bar, this book is fantastic. As a tourist in Rio you will find this book a fun read in addition to your other travel guides. As someone planning to live in Rio (especially Zona Sul) for any significant period of time, you will find this book extremely handy.  
 This pendant is much prettier in person.  It's got a nice polished finish, not satin/matte like in the image.  It hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain.  I've already received several compliments on it.    
  I have had ideas swimming around in my head for years and have aspired to be a writer. Barbara DeMarco-Barrett's wonderful book has helped me to take the plunge and dive into writing. Pen on Fire is full of practical and creative ideas for writers at all levels and is especially designed for busy people who crave time to write.  In sharing openly about her life experiences and how they influence her writing, Barbara has helped me believe that my own life goes beyond the commonplace and that I actually have something to say to others. Her goal is "to get you thinking and help you to figure out what kind of writer you are."  She does this by suggesting topics, offering tips, and most of all giving lots of ENCOURAGEMENT. I am finding myself returning to Pen on Fire again and again. It's definitely a keeper. 
 Overall this CD is a great buy.  I will admit the first time I listened I thought what in the world did I just buy?  After listening again, I realized all of the great talent as well as the gifts of the artists contributing to this tribute to the greatest balladeer ever. All of the artists out did themselves.  John Legend singing Love Won't Let Me Wait, Fantasia 'Til My Baby Comes Home, Alicia Keys (featuring Jermaine Paul {who is Jermanie Paul?}) If This World Were Mine.....They all gave a great new look at songs by Luther!!  Great Job 
 Much like his e-column, Iron Mike gives a big heap of non-stop profanities and more information about his personal habits than you'd ever want to know. If you think this is a bad thing - you're wrong! Anybody who gets  offended easily probably wouldn't want to read it though 
 John Cheever is the poet of mid-century suburbia.  He stings as he sings, gently criticizing a lifestyle that he at the same time embraces and loves.  "The Swimmer" is a tour-de-force; had Cheever been South American, the story would have been labeled magic realism 
 "The Martians have arrived. Let the war begin." A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction "The War of the Worlds". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,"The War of the Worlds" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good.  The story begins directly with the theme. In the last years of the 19th.century,in the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions,England witnesses the most surreal threat:ten bizzare cylinders all containing Martians fall near London. A wave of bitter agony,nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the Martians gradually come to terms with the Earth's gravitational strength,the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war. The greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere. This myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator---an ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy---perceives a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots.   The narrator's town of Maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of Woking,Weybridge,Shepperton and others. The narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin's place in Leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death. In his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful Martians,the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate. The latter is a lost soul whose faith in God and religion has broken in the wake of humanity's greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a Martian dominated Earth is not that improbable,if at all naive. H.G.Wells's artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical,this is a marvellous diusplay of wit,intelligence and clearness of structure.  "The War of the Worlds" on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation. The weahness of mankind in the face of unknown,unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and Wells applies a very,very subtle satire on humans' grotesque complacency on teir own abilities. When the artilleryman admits,"we're down;we're beat" with "absolute conviction",the reader fathoms the author's surrender of "the greatest power in the world" to Fate. On a much higher level,"The War of the Worlds" is a massive comment on man's petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction.  Composed in a sense of retrospection,the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking. and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small England territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume. But even so,"The War of the Worlds" is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster. H.G.Wells was a great visonery in the late 19th.century and it's no less remarkable achievement that this Englishman's great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come. "The War of the Worlds" is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer's craftmanship.    
 If you are interested in the nuts and bolts of remote viewing you need to read this book. It contains a huge amount of information on the protocols and procedures necessary for "successful" remote viewing sessions. While McMoneagle doesn't actually tell the reader how to do remote viewing, his breadth of experience is apparent in this detailed tome. Both beginning and experienced remote viewers will find useful tidbits and, indeed, "secrets" of the trade within these chapters. Everything from the selection of targets to the effects of sidereal time on viewing performance are covered here. Of course, every viewer, government-trained or otherwise, has their particular biases and superstitions about the "right" way to do remote viewing and McMoneagle is no exception. But given his lengthly experience and proven track record in so many scientific and televised demonstrations, it would be wise for viewers and intuitives of all persuasions to take heed and give his perspectives and suggestions some serious consideration. (Dr. Simeon Hein is the author of Opening Minds: A Journey of Extraordinary Encounters, Crop Circles, and Resonance (Mount Baldy Press, Inc., 2002).)  
 When reading this book you get the overwhelming feeling that not only does the author have extensive knowledge of the Chakra system, but has a deep passion for the subject matter as well. Random illustrations, contextualized theories ("traditionally this is believed...this group believes this...I believe this" [it all jives together well]) and all in an easy to read format. Love it - what more can I say? 
 Definately read this book, that's all I can say.  Great insight to the new way the business world is shaping.  Extremely thought provocing information 
 What a heartbreak all the way around.  This book was informative and a great way to read history...without being bored.  Not that there was anything boring about this time period.  Highly recommend this 
 I am a medical student at Texas A&M USHSC COM.  This is the standard for anatomy lab.  No other dissector will do.  I say this simply because almost all medical schools will be following (almost page by page) the general course laid out within this text.  I would not suggest buying the combo pack.  In stead, this book is best used in conjunction with Rohen's (Color Atlas of Anatomy: A Photographic Study of the Human Body), Netter's (Atlas of Human Anatomy), and Moore (Clinically Oriented Anatomy).  *Using the dissector to do a virtual dissection at home with your Rohen every night before lab will greatly increase your yield and decrease your lab time.  This is a very important point (as anyone who has been through this part of medical school can tell you). --> You will need a CLEAN copy for home use.  You should consider this even if you have to buy a spare <--  There are some errors in the dissector, but they are of no consequence as long as you use it in conjunction with the other texts mentioned above 
 In the first couple of chapters, I realize that this is not a novel of spy vs.spy, but an actual resource book that makes 100 % sense.  Mr. Winkler is speaking from experience and his background denotes a lot of it. I was very impressed with his style of writing and the material he covers. If anyone wants a career in Computer Security or Information Assurance, this book is a definite MUST READ and MUST HAVE in your library 
 Lena is a special child.  This story shows how Lena's childhood is different from that of others.  Her "special" gift can sometimes be a source of agony but Lena overcomes it to live a happy childhood.  Praises to Tina Ansa for the unique nature of this story 
 Just have to say that the book is excellent. I started out years ago as a freelance product copywriter for Nike; I'd never written a white paper. And then, lo and behold, a new mass notification industry client requested one. Panic! Could I do it? I had daily anxiety attacks and probably didn't sleep for a week. I ordered the book, read it, panicked some more, and then submitted the paper. My client loved it and had no changes to my first go! The book was so much help; I would not have had any idea where to even start. So thank you, Michael Stelzner! You rock 
 Kismet is one of those sadly overlooked movie musicals which deserves the light of day. As it does not yet exist on dvd, we may as well pay close attention to this delightful cd release, loaded with goodies. The booklet is loaded with facts and photos from the movie, information on the songs and the history of the Broadway show and subsequent movie. But it's the music we came to hear: First off, we have "Rhymes Have I," a rousing opening number filmed yet cut from the film shortly before release. Then there's the complete version of "Radhadlakum," chopped in half in the movie, but intact here with all its Arabian Knights naughtiness. Howard Keel's warm yet powerful baritone excels in 6 numbers. His level of interest in vocal rendition seems far higher than what he provided for contemporary musicals such as "Kiss Me, Kate" or "Annie Get Your Gun;" he really seems to have been interested in making this film work for him vocally; it shows. While he was hardly a slacker in those other films, his voice is twice as good in this particular film. The now obscure--and undeservedly so--Dolores Gray primes her sultry pipes seductively (what else?) in "Bored," a number written especially for this film. Then she outrights swings in "Not Since Ninevah," a number in this cd coupled with the jazziest dance break of the movie. A young Vic Damone boldly displays the talents that would make him a huge star in "Stranger in Paradise," the most memorable, hauntingly lyrical, and widely-covered song in the show (who HASN'T covered 'Stranger' at some point?) His rendition here is worth the price of the entire cd. Ann Blyth contributes her usual fine vocals to the mix, clearly enjoying herself especially in "Baubles, Bangles and Beads," and "Rhymes Have I." The cd wraps up with Keel's haunting "Sands of Time," a number originally used as a bookend in the Broadway version, but here used as a lasting and lingering reminder of the delights we have just enjoyed 
 I've been tutoring SAT students in Manhattan, Connecticut, and New Jersey for ten years now, and I've never seen any other resource or material like this book/CD. It's really a whole new way to approach studying vocab - one of the most dreaded and most necessary parts of preparing for the test - that I think students will really go for. The songs are terrific! I just got my hands on this book (after a friend recommended it) and can't wait to use it with my students this fall. 
 This is a great little book to read to lift your spirits and make you smile.  There is nothing profound about it, but it does make you think, makes you realize that there are things you have yet to discover about yourself and the world around you and there are things you have already discovered (to which you are thankful for having already discovered them).  My favorite quip from this book was that "If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging."  It's so simple, yet so true.  It made me take a step back and realize that there is a brighter side to things, but that it does not necessarily mean that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.  There are many more fun, humorous, deep, and handy 'lessons' in this compact book, and don't overlook the intro.  It's a great read for a quiet afternoon or a fantastic gift for an old friend.  Enjoy!! 
 I really enjoyed reading The Serpent on the Crown.  This book is a great example of the Amelia Peabody series.  Now that the grandchildren are growing up, her descriptions of them are really delightful.  I also enjoy the parts of the manuscripts by "H" because they add more details to the story.  If you are a new Amelia Peabody mystery reader, you should probably start with one of the earlier books, such as the Snake and the Crocodile, or The Last Camel Died at Noon.  The Serpent on the Crown doesn't really explain any of the "family quirks" that regular readers have come to enjoy.    I read this book too quickly because I couldn't put it down.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will probably read it over again.  
 Sascha, Sascha, Sascha.  Twisted, demented, perverse, and outright evil to the core...but you have to love her, oh, his, um, I mean its personality.  This is the book that truely gives WOD fans an inside look at the workings of the Sabbat and a glimpse into the mind of its spiritual core.  Griffin does a wonderful job of carrying the overall metaplot of the clan novels throughout the book while also making Tzimisce a unique stand alone experience.  Even vampire fans who aren't familiar with White Wolf's World of Darkness can stil appreciate the subtle innuendos and blatant brutality that bleed throughout this book.  
 My 18 month old son got this for Christmas.  He love love loves it.  He thinks it's great fun to raise and lower the steering wheel, he knows how to do it, but it's a bit too tight of a latch for him to operate on his own.  As soon as we started putting it together (Light assembly required, he helped, but he also had a blast with the box. I would recommend this product to a friend, or even buy it for another child around his age. 
 I have studied Japanese for quite some time, and managed to get a good grasp of basic vocabulary and most sentence patterns, but was at a loss for words when the conversation became the least bit intellectual.  This book  filled in the gap in my Japanese quite nicely.  Most textbooks are geared  at least in part for the tourist, presenting practical, but simplistic  conversations.  If you know that you are going to need to discuss anything  beyond the weather and your health in Japanese, I would strongly recommend  this book 
 This book was terrific. So sad that Damien's free life ended while he was basically just a kid, but from the weeds he has grown to flower, and it was comforting to know, that he met his wife through this ordeal, that at least SOMETHING good happened from this travesty. On a side note, thought it was odd that there were a lot of misspellings in the book, for a character named Brian, 'Brian' and "Brain' were used inter-mixed as well as a lot of other typo's, not sure if they wanted to keep the original text as written or just really poor editors 
 Quantum physicians have started to realise a simple truth: we are in charge of our lives and it is us who totally create our reality. Anything is possible only as long as we can imagine it and if we have the will to do anything required to get what we want, we will get it. This is a very powerful message and it made Andrew Carnegie one of the richest men on the planet (who later inspired Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge). Nobody says that getting rich is easy, or that any other undertaking that you may have is. However, you have the key to your own success in your own hand, whatever it is that you may wish for.  Some of the advice that Napoleon Hill gives may be a little outdated and you may disagree with it, however the key message of this book is one that you cannot miss. And indeed the very easy, straight-forward style of this work does help a lot. For the author does not express the key message directly, he rather points to it, and lets you discover it on your own. Why? Because the message is so simply and so powerful that if someone just told you, you would not see the importance as much, as in this case, where you have to figure it out on your own.  Five stars are awarded to this book, as it is one that you should definitely have on your shelf. It has the power to truly change your life around if only you want it. And indeed, it is very different to most self-improvement books, as it doesn't tell you what to do, but invites you to fulfil your dreams whatever they may be. Read it - you won't be disappointed 
 I read this book over the summer and it was GREAT!  I have to admit, I didn't really get into it until I read a few chapters.  But towards the ending it gets so exhilarating!  I would have never guessed the ending; it was great fun trying, though!  There are some points where you think, "She's never going to get out of this!" but she's usually smart enough to escape anything that happens to her.   There were also some times where you are thinking, "Why did she do that?!  She wasn't even thinking!"  but it all turns out for the best in the end.  Well... not EVERYTHING, but... well... read this story and you'll know what I mean 
 This oil smells so good, I just love it. All of my friends say I smell so good 
 Recently, I've had the pleasure of reading several newly published non-fiction volumes of the Great War, and they have inspired me to dust off my old Scribners edition Hemingway volume of A FAREWELL TO ARMS, the book that oh so many years ago, sparked my interest in learning all I could about the First World War. After many years of not reading Hemingway, the book reminded me once again of his brilliance.   This classic war torn love story certainly isn't for everyone. I say that because many readers insist on the main characters being likeable people, and the main characters here, Frederick Henry, an American ambulance driver attached to the Italian army and Catherine Barkley, a Scottish nurse, are far from likeable characters. Henry, whose character is loosely modeled after Hemmingway, is a rather self centered and uncaring character, while Barkley is portrayed as a rather desperate and lonely woman willing to sacrifice her virtues for companionship. Neither are traits inspiring among leading character roles.   This fact lends credence to Hemingway's masterful writing skills as he transcends the norm and presents rather unlikable characters into an extraordinary tale that will envelope most readers into the fabric of their stories. Hemingway accomplishes this by making his unlikable characters extraordinarily real. Like it or not, even the best of us humans have character flaws at some point in our lives and most readers will identify with aspects of reality we don't always aspire to present.   Hemingway presents battle images that are truly brutal. When it comes to war, what we think of today as brutal today, often pales in comparison to the reality of the Great War. The story is beautifully told, masterfully constructed and moves the reader to feel the emotions that I think Hemingway wanted to produce which centrally included a bitter distrust of that war and war in general, and the complexity but power of a love affair between two fairly normal but relatively insignificant and imperfect people.  I do not consider this Hemingway's best work, but it is essential reading nonetheless. 
 Of the FIFTH DISCIPLINE SERIES books, THE DANCE OF CHANGE is by far the most important for you to understand. THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE and THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE FIELDBOOK are wonderful, valuable books, but they largely avoid  the tough question of how to sustain a Learning Organization initiative.  Based on lots of experiences in different companies, THE DANCE OF CHANGE is  the most realistic, thorough, thoughtful work on achieving large-scale  organizational change that has ever been my pleasure to read. I immediately  found it helpful in overcoming some of my bad habits (including falling in  love with my own jargon rather than using common English). Since I first  read the book about 9 months ago, I have found it affecting my consulting  practice by causing me to focus more on lasting change, than immediate  change.  That's an important lesson for everyone. Like THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE  FIELDBOOK, THE DANCE OF CHANGE allows you to focus on the areas where you  need help the most. The beginning is a wonderful systems-dynamic analysis  of how successful change occurs, and how it can be derailed. Like THE FIFTH  DISCIPLINE FIELDBOOK, you do not need to read THE DANCE OF CHANGE from  front to back.  I found myself skipping around, and enjoyed the experience.   Even if you do not want to have a Learning Organization, you will find THE  DANCE OF CHANGE very valuable for giving you direction on how to achieve  permanent, valuable changes. On the subject of achieving the strategy you  wish to implement, I strongly urge you to also read THE BALANCED SCORECARD.  These books are good complements to each other.  For picking up on your  most important issues, you will find Peter Drucker's MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES  FOR THE 21ST CENTURY to be invaluable 
 My son got this book for his 2nd birthday and he really likes it.  When I read it I really ham it up and he laughs out loud every time.  It's very cute and a pretty quick read (for those with shorter attention spans).  I would definitely recommend this book 
 if you have "Mechassault" and an xbox live gamer tag try playing me!i usually play capture the flag and my gamer tag is "minor00" so if you see me be sure to challenge me to a game because this game rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Excellent movie, made you feel like you were in the middle of the action. Keeps you on the edge of your seat even when you know the ending 
 This album isn't nearly as popular, but in my opinion it is just as good as "Dirt". Due to Layne's illness they were unable to tour and promote this gem properly, but it still had some moderate radio hits in the beatiful "Heaven Beside You", the rocking "Again", and the shockingly dark and powerful "Grind". These are great, quintessential AIC songs but the thing is, they are far from the best on the album. Jerry Cantrell has said in interviews that if they had toured to promote the album, "God Am" would have been released as a single, and this breaks my heart. Lyrically and musically I would rank "God Am" as one of the best AIC songs ever. My personal favorite on the album is "Shame in You" a slow, chilled AIC song that gives Layne the chance to show off his amazing voice and Jerry the chance to shred amazing guitar parts in almost bluesy fashion. "Head Creeps" and "Sludge Factory" definetly deserve mention as well: these songs are dark and almost frightening, but feature cool lyrics, guitar work, and Layne's amazing and distorted voice. You will find yourself immediately drawn in a jamming after a single listen. If you like Dirt, please buy this album, you will be surprised how quickly it grows on you. 
 S.S.T. does it again with her 3rd book!!  This is a thouroughly enjoyable read.  Taylor continues to develop her characters and her writing style continues to make feel transported to New England.  I cannot wait for her fourth book! 
 I love my Silk Tank Tops.  I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice. Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks. The quality is very good for the price. The initial fit was just a tad snug, but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now.  I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk. But for casual wear, or sleeping at night I love them.  
 I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. Hard to label this one...comedy..drama...and a big-time suprise ending that any great thriller would be proud of...wow..I just didn't expect THAT! This is a really cool movie. A little heavier than Costner's usual light romantic comedy, but he's still at his best in these type of roles...Interesting and unusual movie. 
 Had read Rawlings' book many years ago, and, having recently visited her home at Cross Creek, decided to reread it.  More enjoyable the second time around. Her descriptive narrative sings with the essence of central Florida living circa 1930s. Enjoy a slice of history served up with grits and white bacon. Satisfying to the soul 
 I'm proof that Tammi's plan works.  I lost 27 pounds of fat and 16.5 inches in 12 weeks.  With Tammi's guide I learned how easy it can be to eat healthy foods and promote weight loss.  Her book is easy to understand, motivational and will show you how to achieve similar results.  It can work for you too!  You won't be disapointed. The knowledge and confidence I received from Tammi have literally changed my life.  This is not a magic pill but the tools she gives you are.  Find out why Wenatchee, Washington sings the praises of Tammi Flynn! 
 I see here lot critics blaming Yanni for being reptitious. I think they are simply Deaf or dont know how to identify patterns or simply they cant do anything else apart from critisizing. Yanni's music has varied patterns, not same and they are introduced at approriate beats in his music. Even beethoven would have appreciated it.Anyway this is a must own cd 
 More raw and experimental than "69 Live." Better (and warmer) sound, to my ears, than Max's. Never mind the tape hiss and lo-fi--the music gets through. As others here have said, this is not the best place to begin listening to the Velvets, but if you already are a fan, you will love it. The sprawling stretches of "Sister Ray" and other extended versions of VU songs are a revelation. There is nothing like the shock of hearing a band you revere live for the first time. This set can bring you quite close to that experience. 
 The Aleister Crowley Thoth Tarot comes with a booklet to help interpret the cards. The definitions are not very in depth and vague. I read a shorter book by a different author and helped a lot. This one is by Crowley himself. A few pages description of interpretation and commentary is included for each card. It was very helpful. Now whenever I do tarot readings from the Thoth deck I can have easy help. Recommended for more advanced students of both Tarot and Crowley. This one didn't take very long for me to read as I can read very well and liked the book a great deal so as to keep turning the pages. I could easily see how this could seriously disturb someone, but some thought it was funny 
 For those who still hold out some hope for the power of religion to help build lasting peace, Marc Gopin's book is one of the best works available as a guide to just how important and just how difficult the work is.  One could indeed wish that this book were a little more tightly organized, but the true, underlying factor is the degree of difficulty that Gopin has attempted in terms of personal and theological honesty.  This is a painful book to read at many points, and it takes religious people right to the brink of despair in terms of ever finding enough truly common ground to move even the most religious to deeper relationships of peace and justice.  Those looking for easy, pat answers will be profoundly disappointed by the book.  Those looking for easy rationales for taking sides in religious, political and military conflict will be annoyed.  But those looking for seasoned and searching guidance in some of the hardest and most urgent issues facing religious people today will find much wisdom and much reason for renewed reflection.  Despite hard experiences that have clearly challenged the core of his faith identity, Gopin still believes that religions have the power to bring about a better world for everyone, even where conflict seems the most intractable.  We need to hope he is right, for all our sakes.   Not an easy book on any level, but a worthwhile one.  I expect another volume that develops many of the individual themes more fully. 
 as the above says, I have not encountered a novel that offered a better look into the daily lives of the beats from a "sort of" outsiders point of view 
 Great book!!! Exciteing and mysterious. If you like books about the civil war this is the book. Sad, happy, funny, everything in one. Detail is great!!! The perfect book for kids to enjoy but yet there learning some  history 
 Colonel David Hunt in THEY JUST DON'T GET IT warns the reader that not only is this country in danger from terrorists but he fears that this danger is more likely to grow than to shrink. The United States is surrounded by those who wish us harm in ways that range from the nuclear to the biological.  Hunt notes that this danger is exacerbated by those whose very job it is to protect us.  To his credit, Hunt does not only blame the Left. The current administration must shoulder, in its inability to close our borders, its own fair share of the blame.  Still, Hunt saves most of his verbal bullets for those who seek to place partisan politics over national security.  Hunt starts off by identifying those who wish America harm: the Saudis, the Russian mafia, Syria, North Korea, Iran, Al Qaeda.  Hunt tends to lump these threats into two camps: the non-Islamics (Russia and North Korea) and Islamofascists (the majority of the Arab world). He notes the tendency of the left to have a politically correct view concerning our enemies.  To avoid offending the Moslem world is more important, in the eyes of the PC crowd, than to face the stark truth that "we are fighting a religious war, and knowing it is the first step in winning it." (page 59)  Playing the geopolitical ostrich is, he warns, a sure way to be devoured by an onrushing Moslem lion that sees the United States as morally unwilling to do what must be done to remain alive.  Hunt has many suggestions that he says are long overdue.  Our various intelligence services all too often function at cross purposes so that one does not know what the other does.  The solution, he suggests is to "put one person in charge--really in charge" (page 74) of all such agencies.  He sees our military in the same sad state as our intelligence services.  The real villain here is the huge bureaucracy that creates a lack of accountability.  Cut it, he urges, down to a more manageable size. In his chapter "What Can We Do?" he lists commonsense tasks that ought to be done by all Americans: Face the facts; we have to kill the bad guys in unPC ways; we must be better informed by accessing news sources that exclude the gloom and doom rhetoric of the New York Times; and finally he urges all Americans to shout out "we are angry as hell and won't take it any more."    It is not likely that "they" are ever going to "get" it.  Hunt understands that "we" are going to have to do just that if this country wants to avoid further repetitions of Pearl Harbor like attacks that surely the Left would blame on Bush 
 Those songs reminded me of my young schooling days sitting next to a musical hall, where beautiful trad Chinese music was practiced non-stop. Little did I know that those days influenced me well into my adulthood, was I lucky to have day dreamed away in my math class, being carried away with those fabulous musical pieces. Thank heavens 
 What is real? How do we really judge other people? How do we know what we know? How do perceptions influence social interactions? These are the kinds of reflective questions this book causes you to think about.  Set in 16th century France, this case of mistaken identity, where one person assumes the identity of another, is intentionally ambiguous in drawing the reader in to make some personal judgments independent of the author. This masterful technique requires an active reader.   Chapter 10 describes one of the judges in the case after it was appealed. He went on to write a book on the matter. Jean de Coras was a Christian scholar, a writer, lawyer, romantic, and communicator. Fortunately for us the author included this excerpt on him, as he was a character who made a mark that has survived over time.  Overall this is a book that will make you consider yourself and how you treat other people. It's a healthy form of reflection that is designed to help you consider things you might otherwise overlook 
 Written in 1952, Fanon's novel is a response to Mannoni's 'Prospero complex', which states that white colonizers have a symbiotic relationship to the races they colonize, and that this relationship is built upon a system of mutual dependence. The whites have a need to dominate, and the other races have a need to be dominated. Fanon  passionately and accurately REJECTS this theory, saying that the only neurosis resides in the white male, and his innate fear of other races. Taking his discourse to the sports arena and the bedroom, Fanon argues that the white male possesses a sexual-performance anxiety toward other races, especially the African. He fears he will be outmatched on the field, and outlasted in bed, by the African. It is this fear that causes the xenophobic anxiety within the white male, and propels him to subdue and dominate the other races. Fanon argues that the Africans were doing pretty well before the colonizers came along, but now all worlds are forever changed. Although this book is an angry argument against white ideas of dominance, I find it to be largely accurate and an imperative read for anyone hoping to gain greater insight into the 'true' motivations behind racialism 
 An inspirational collection from an excellent essayist. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in literature 
 Get inside the mind of Pitagoras and Plato and discover an extraordinary interpretation of music. Then drift away through Reinassence Science till the XX century and find how connected the universe, the music and the human  mind are. Music can even start a rebellion, as it happened in Belgica 
 I bought this cookbook after checking it out from the library two times in a row.  It was so good, I wanted one!  In fact, it was so good I bought two, one for me and one for my best friend.  Most of the recipes are vegetarian, and can be adapted to vegan if needed.  The entire book is worth the price for the soy chorizo recipe.  It is excellent 
 If you have ever heard of the Kelly Criteria for position-sizing, or wondered if Optimal F is a good way to manage risk, this book is for you. In a narrative, story-telling style that is much easier reading than a mathematical, economic, or statistical textbook, the author covers a whole range of interesting and informative theories that are relevant to trading and investing.  Knowing that a trader who uses the Kelly Formula to maximize return always has a 50% chance of losing 50% (or X% chance of losing (100-X)% generally) of their capital may be an eye-opener for many traders. Although this book will not tell you how to make money trading, it will generate more than a handful of useful areas of research, and get you thinking about risk management rather than entry signals.  Covering a multitude of financial, economic, and mathematical geniuses, this book has many interesting side-stories and anecdotes that are amusing, interesting and thought-provoking. The majority of this book is not strictly about trading, but all of the ideas have some application to trading and investing if you think hard and long enough 
 I would not consider myself a big fan of poetry, in fact this is the first book of poetry I've ever read.  But I would highly recommend this book because it contains many classic love poems and authors.  There are many poems in this little collection that will move anyone who has experienced love 
 Geoffrey Wolff's bio of the poet, publisher, and mystic Harry Crosby is a terrific read as well as a singularly important contribution to the unfortunately slender body of scholarship on Harry Crosby. Despite  persistent popular and academic interest in 1920s literary Paris, Crosby  & the Black Sun Press are generally ignored completely or dismissed as  marginal. This is truly puzzling. Wolff's biography, while certainly not  uncritical, nevertheless does take the man seriously and offers an  absorbing account of the life & work of a true original 
 This is the 3rd book in the Mitch Rapp series, and the 4th overall in Flynn's version of DC.  I was glad to get some closure from the unresolved issues from the previous novel.  It's actually a shame that it wasn't all written as one piece of work.  The reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the pacing.  There is a lot of recap over the course of the first 100 pages.  I realize that you need to get readers caught up if they haven't read the other books in the series, but there has to be a better way of doing it.  Once you get past the recapping, everything moves along at a good pace.  The ending is kind of rushed, but that seems to be Flynn's style.  It's not too big of a negative, but for an operation as big as what they were trying to pull off, it should have probably been detailed in more than 5-10 pages.  Overall, I love this series and have already bought the next two.  Hopefully now that all the issues are resolved, there won't be so much backstory to start the next book 
 HPLovecraft was the greatest horror writer since Edgar Alan Poe and there have been none as great since.  This is the second volume of hopefully a long series that give his stories with a very detailed annotation on words  and items in the story that are no longer in common use (the stories were  written in the time frame of 1920 to 1935)  and the background.  HPL  created a rich mythos that was very involved.  The annotations here provide  crossreferencing to other stories.  The stories included in this anthology  are not all of his biggest or greatest, but the information makes them all  interesting. The only warning is that if you have not read these stories  before, either read them from some other book or read them with out the  footnotes first time.  The stories have a flow that sets a mood.  Reading  the footnotes the first time will disrupt the continuity 
 The starting of this book is very slow, then it turns into a book you can't put down.  The main character in the book is Anna Pigeon, who is a park ranger in West Texas.  She is hiking down in the walls of McKiirick Canyon and she find another park ranger dead.  The ranger had cat scratches on her. Everone thinks a cat killed her but Anna just can't believe that a cat in West Texas would kill and not eat its prey.  Anna start investigating on her own.  She uncovers other clues. As she does many other deaths occur.  The end of this story is a big surprise.  Read it, it's very intertaining 
     I enjoyed "Mirror, Mirror" as much as I did Maguire's other books, having read them all. His treatment of the dwarves as stone demigods brought to solidity by Bianca's attention is masterfully constructed. Likewise his synthesis of the magical side of the story with the hard reality of 16th Century Italian politics is nothing short of miraculous.       My only criticism regards the choice of the historical Lucrezia Borgia as the "Wicked Queen". Modern scholarship seems to suggest that Lucrezia's unsavory reputation is in reality a fiction, initiated by Borgia enemies, and maintained over the centuries by the affection of folks for true personifications of evil; that she was in fact a rather gentle, kind, and generous person by nature, certainly the victim of dreadful life events and family ties; and, even if not totally innocent (Who is?), then certainly the least wicked of her family. I believe this woman has been maligned enough by innuendo and rumor, and deserves better than Mr. Maguire's treatment 
 This neck pillow is REAL comfy , cozy, soft & squishy---guess you can tell we like it. 
 My reviews for the first two issues of Checker's Steve Canyon series would suggest that my mind is made up in advance in its favour. Actually, the strip has a couple of strikes against it: 1) the hero is a little bland and too iconically good for my tastes and 2) while patriotism may have its place, if it crosses into jingoism it becomes an irritant. However, the sidekick Happy Easter provides a little peanut butter and jelly to Canyon's white bread, and the patriotism had been somewhat discreet up to this point, being limited to the bad guys' animosity to Yankee-ness and the good guys being paragons of virtue and know-how. The strip's great qualities overwhelm these minor irritants.   How Canyon's unwavering righteousness will navigate the sixties and its antiheroes, should the Checker series make it that far - and I hope it will - will be a very interesting meta-thread in which a fictional character is pitted against forces outside his semi-fictional world. It's a matter of record that this precipitated his creator's semi-retirement and the strip's decline. I hope the Checker series continues on through Steve Canyon's full run.   I was forewarned that the strip would be marred to some extent by the jingoism, which is what the patriotism turns into when it commandeers the storyline in the first thirty pages (three months (!)) of this issue where a young (and so far irritating) recruit to Canyon's team has to find the movie that is most representative of life in America, even soliciting readers' help for the task. There is also a paean to the freedoms in the USA by one character showing home movies; ironically, this was during the height of the McCarthy era. Nevertheless, the strip is a historical record and this plot detour has to be accepted part and parcel with it. Some seeds for what follows are sown in the meantime and the rest of the book is as entertaining as the others.   We are now equipped with enough hindsight to note the irony of the ode to the freedoms in the USA in a volume of strips that are concurrent with the height of the McCarthy era. As a historical record, the Canyon series could be an excellent backdrop to post-WWII American history as might be taught in high school or even college.   Consider the following sampling of topics the strip can inspire:   - communism and anti-communism;  - the comics syndicates and the various filters (including consideration of the readership itself) through which American culture must pass before reaching the reader's eye;  - the cigarette as a prop in movies and comics (did/does Big Tobacco finance this? does it represent emancipation, cool?);  - American foreign policy, real vs. perceived - is it the same thing?;  the rituals of courtship, growing up, gender-based roles;  - geography - where is (fictional) Damma?, what are the (not so fictional) people of the Bear?;  - the technological innovations that appear in the strip;  - the styles;  - the paucity of American blacks;  - references to real events;  - post-Pearl Harbor vs. post-9/11, followed up with comparisons between the threat of fascism, then communism, and today's threat of terrorism;  - the worldview - is it worldly or is it naïve? Consider the depictions and characterizations of other races.   This series can inspire a huge number of points, many of which are highly pertinent today. The painstaking research Caniff did for his creation makes it especially reliable.   The great strengths of the strip shine through: the stories are rich and eventful, the art stunning, the characters varied and interesting, and the locales as exotic as ever. Unlike many other strips, this one does not rely excessively on cheap devices, such as crazy coincidences, cheating on timelines or resorting to deus ex machina, all of which are replete in adventure strips, though some suspension of disbelief is required. Steve Canyon is the polished work of a seasoned master 
 I find it odd that when reviewing the reviews of this film that people seem to either give it perfect or abysmal scores.  The dichotomy of opinion is probably a direct result of the skill and immense power of Leconte's images, (especially those that his chosen actress affords us).   	 Leconte is a master and quite possibly the greatest living auteur currently making films.  His movies often contain a refreshing difficulty that gives one hope that images still mean something, that film is still worthy of being explicated, that someone still cares enough to think that much without being overly clever such as the Coens and Anderson.  I shouldn't say still.  I should say is and will be, as Leconte is on a different level than any who has ever worked including Kieslowski (the master of images).  I enjoy how Leconte has said that although it was his second period piece he approached the film as if that had nothing to do with it, learning from "Ridicule".  I should point that out I have no problem with "Ridicule" and the fact that it is a period piece has a great deal to do with the presentation, but I can see what he meant.  Like I said, I enjoy the statement, but I should also point out I'm a jerk.  Binoche and Auteuil are two of my favorite actors and this film shows them at their virtuosic best.  They deliver amazing performances of a truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love for the other which in itself contains ultimate trust of decision and character.  Possibly more Auteuil's for Binoche's but the sympathy generated by his character fuels her as an equally sharing partner, making any difference negligible.  There is a third character, Neel, but he is there only to accentuate the relationship between the other two.  The movie, quite simply is about unconditional love and what it means to love unconditionally.  There is a subplot of equal merits (mainly concerning Neel) about the belief in redemption, and what it truly means to believe in redemption.  In short it is about the consequences of action through belief, more so out of the love for another than those of moral ground or stance.  Some people are not willing to accept the belief that actions can or should occur solely out of sympathy for another.  Some people will never allow themselves to love unconditionally.  Some people will not understand or even like this film.   Binoche deserves a prize that doesn't yet exist for her most exquisite performance.  Leconte deserves recognition for what he has done and what he has given us with this film, certainly one of the best I have ever seen.  
 If you are looking for a good, solid intro to this channel by someone who knows Arabic and has knowledge of the region, this is the book. But it relies too heavily on information already in the public domain, in the form of news features in major US newspapers, and buys into the whole "Palestine is the heart of the Arab despair" far too uncritically. You also want to know more about the more controversial episodes -- like the sacking of British Muslim convert Yvonne Ridley -- than is offered. I've read elsewhere she was sacked for writing anti-US articles, and that there was some fuss about her complaining when Al-Jazeera English language website pulled two cartoons after the US objected to them. You keep getting the feeling that there is more to all the anacdotes/events Hugh Miles so captivatingly relates. His comment that Israel is beyond criticism in the US media is simply ridiculous. I think the author is still very young -- in his early 30s -- which might explain why these kind of comments come across as naive... 
 Alexander, Who's Not (Do you hear me? I mean it!) Going to move by Judith Viorst is a great childrens book.  It is wonderfully illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser. The storyline is realistic and approaches a subject in a creative style.  It is attractive to young readers and manages to shed light on Alexander's negative feelings towards moving. Alexander ends up happy and so will the reader 
 I really dont understand how Welsh gets his ideas for his books. Each of them is so complicated yet so captivating, and the story is extremely original. A man that is in a coma, imagining that he is actually in africa hunting a stork, while telling us about his life and how he got into the situation he is in, mixed with some of the dialoge that is happening right there in the hospital where he is at. The plot is all combined, and the stories seem to blend as the book goes along. I really enjoyed reading Marabou Stork, I rate it the best between Filth and Acid House, which are the other Welsh books Ive read, I will definetely try to enjoy more of Welsh's books 
 As I am writing this review "The Key to Solomon's Key: Secrets of Magic and Masonry," has been on the market for less than a month and it is already Amazon's #1 best-selling book in the category of "Magic." That's not surprising. Its author has a habit of writing popular and surprisingly understandable (and at times hilarious) books on the most esoteric aspects of the Western Mystery Tradition (Ceremonial Magick, Aleister Crowley, Tarot & Kabbalah). While I'm sure his new book will be eagerly snatched up and devoured by his magical fans, it looks like this time DuQuette will get to inform, shock, and entertain a far larger audience -- those who have been touched by the provocative ideas spawned by Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code and other not-so-fictional best-sellers that dare to challenge our comfortable understanding of the history of Western civilization and issues concerning the origins and motives of three great religions. The author's message is disarmingly simple, and once the reader has come to terms with its full implications a thousand questions will answer themselves; questions that have haunted us all; questions about the Bible, the history of the Church, the Crusades (and for many of us), the Knight's Templar, the Freemasons,  forbidden rites of magic, and the nature of human consciousness. This book could change your mind. This book could change the world 
 As a developmental psychologist, I understand how children develop and behave.  As a father, I understand how perplexing their behavior often seems.  Dr. Walsh has managed to use the latest information in developmental neuroscience to tie these two sides together in a way that the lay reader will comprehend, which ultimately will help parents of adolescents to stop being so perplexed and to be able to interact with their adolescents in a positive way.  Dr. Walsh, as always, mixes science with common sense and humor, and provides research-based advice that all parents can use.  This is one reason why his organization, the National Institute on Media and the Family (www.mediafamily.org), has become such a trusted resource for parents, educators, and policy-makers 
 Some of this is just common sense. But some of this was life changing for my family.   The chapters in this book build upon themselves and as they grow they develop the theme of families being worth the effort. There are stories of real life situations, quotes, examples and more.    One chapter is about making a plan and making a statement. And while I know this is based on a business type mode, we tried it. We made a Family Statement and it has been a large part of our lives. My children will recite it and use it as a reminder of what we expect of them.   It is a great book. One that will have a place on my bookshelves for many years to come. 
 This wipes is the best. It smells good, non-alcoholic and is perfect for even the most sensitive skin. Try it! You won't regret 
 Skagen makes this watch very thin and lightweight with an unbeatable affordable price for titanium watches.  The watch is only categorized as a fashion watch because it looks good for its price.  The quality of the clasp is terrible.  I bought this watch for my boyfriend for vday and he said that the clasp keeps on popping off easily.  He does like the watch besides of that factor cause it is light and great for a everyday beater watch 
 Everybody knows that asset allocation is the only significant factor in portfolio performance. Right?  Well, no. Bogle starts with the Jahnke research article "The Hoax Of Asset Allocation" and piles on mountains of his own research to demonstrate beyond doubt that cost is what really matters in every asset class imaginable.  That being the case, indexing is the only rational investment strategy because index funds (and, these days, index ETFs) have by far the lowest costs.  This edition was written before the dot-com crash; the revised edition will make for fascinating reading: which views have changed, which have been reinforced?  It's a little hard to know who Bogle's intended audience is.   The analysis is too deep for casual reader/investors (I might even say that you need to share his enthusiastic obsession to get through it all).  Plus, he is so intent on proving how important cost is that he gives such matters as diversification virtually no attention except to say that it's a good thing. Unless you agree with the implication that you should simply buy Vanguard's Balanced Index Fund (VBINX) and be done with it, you will need to look elsewhere for advice on matters other than cost.  Bogle devotes the last third of the book to a discussion of how the fund industry should restructure itself to better serve the investor. Since it obviously won't ever happen that sheep will not get shorn, it's rather sad and quixotic.   In fact, considering the sad state of affairs at TIAA/CREF, once a bastion of customer service now gone to hell for the sake of corporate profits, it's worrisome to consider whether Vanguard will go down that same road once the old man is safely out of the picture.  The end of the book is a brief autobiography of his creation, Vanguard, and the index fund that rocked the world.  I think Bogle is the best. An inspiring example for the ages who single-handedly created the opportunity for individual investors to succeed. I come to his book with that bias and I slogged through it all because of my admiration. Not everyone will be sufficiently motivated to put in the effort, however, even though they would be rewarded for it if they did 
 .....who never really liked cooking. She actually received this gift from co-workers as a joke! Recently, while visting her city, I spent several days with her and she decided to show off her new cooking skills, telling me that I'd be the "guinea pig". With this she held up her copy of Cooking for Dummies and explained how she came to possess it. This book starts very simply apparently, explaining such things as the difference between "boil" and "broil" and how to tell if meat is cooked. It's perfect for those who've really never done a day of cooking in their lives or those who are still in the fairly early stages of learning cooking basics. It proceeds slowly until the point where the reader is actually ready to put together a dish and can follow the book's recipes. Well, my cousin wowed me over the next several days and really put together some quite tasty meals! I recommend this book for all novice cooks!!! If she can do it, you can too!! 
 This is a great hot plate for a bachelor pad or if you live somewhere without a kitchen, like me! The plate size is a little big larger than most hot plates. For a hot plate, it heats up fairly quickly. The only drawback is that the surface has little ridges running from the center to the edge so if something gets spilled on the plate it's hard to clean.   This is an update six months later: This little hot plate gave us many dinners until it died a couple of weeks ago. We had the hot plate for about six months and then it kicked the bucket. So sad. I wouldn't recommend this hot plate to anybody who will use it on a daily basis. It might be good for casual use. 
 I completed my first 5K and just finished my first marathon using the training programs in this book. And I did almost all of my training on the treadmill. IT WORKS 
 I'm a Beat Takeshi (Kitano) fan, what else can I say.  The "man" does it again!  I also agree with the others that, "If you don't like blood, don't see this film!"  Five stars!  
 I really like this series.I was hoping this one came out before Bleach at least here in the US.THis was Tite Kubo's earler work before Bleach.I like the character design, the plot , the characters are very intersting and comedy is not bad at all- about the same as Bleach. Hope they make this into an anime.  
 What a great book!  It is refreshing to read a historical guide that doesn't take itself too seriously.  On This Spot brings the sights and history to life for us transplated Washingtonians.  While the book can be  used as a walking tour guide, it can just as easily take you on a tour  through history from your living room.  Makes me feel like I am in  Washington again 
 This book is well written and contains a helpful CD with a great set of sample guidelines that acts as a terrific cheat sheet of the book's main points 
 I fondly remember this book from my childhood and wanted to share it with my children. They love the story and even act out the parts and try to balance several hats on their heads. My 3 yr old requests it practically every night 
 Far from wild-eyed raving religious fanatics, the 19 men who struck on 9/11, were by and large middle class and from secular backgrounds. How these seemingly unexceptional young men became suicide soldiers for Al Qaeda is the story that's told here. It's their decided ordinariness and their descent into fundamentalist jihad that makes this such a frightening read.   McDermott paints chilling portraits of the leaders of the 19. Young and lonely Middle Easterners floundering in German colleges, their insecurities lead them to the Islamic fundamentalism preached in Hamburg mosques. Like moths drawn to a flame,  they find the direction, certainty and purpose they so crave. Once immersed in the tenets of jihad, they move on to Al Qaeda's terrorist training camps in Afgahnistan. Here, they are hand-picked by Al Qaeda's leadership to go to the U.S. to train to be pilots. The rest, as they say, is history.   The question that's never really answered here is why these men did it, why they sacrificed their own lives to kill innocent civilians. Perhaps no one will ever know. Perhaps the answer is beside the point.  
 Unusual and fascinating, follows a typical day in the White House, weaving together past and present, presidents and worker bees.  My 6-year-old daughter was transfixed and so was I 
 I first discovered this wonderful album as a two disk vinyl set checked out from the public library. Synthesizers were my high school fascination and I'd already discovered Tomita's "Pictures at an Exhibition" & Wendy's (then Walter Carlos') "Switched on Bach". But this... there was nothing like this, nothing I could even compare it to. Each side of the two albums was a season (Sonic Seasonings), winter, spring, summer, fall; Each a unique tapestry of sound exploration, like a sound track for your imagination. Summer is one of my favorites, the sounds of frogs and crickets flowing by creates the mental image of flying low over a planet of ponds and swamps. Wendy was so far ahead of her time with this spectacular album that there weren't even terms for it yet. I wore out the library's copy and eventually the copy I bought. I was overjoyed to discover it was finally available on CD, in the digital format it was meant to be heard in. The new "bonus" tracks compliment the original work... the sound of a rocking chair and a cat purring in your lap! If you like music that broadens your mind, you'll love this masterpiece of sonic wizardry 
 Terrific book for learning how to set goals and change your thinking in order to become more successful. 
 Emil Fackenheim was one of the great Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century. He was a person of great integrity who deeply cared for the Jewish people. His understanding of Jerusalem as the spiritual center of the Jewish people was one major element of his thought. His concern with Jewish survival after the Shoah was another central element. As a survivor of Sachsenhausen concentration camp, as one who was trained as a Rabbi, and became an academic philosopher he had a background which moved him to a very deep reading and thinking about Jewish history. All this comes to focus in 'To Mend the World' where he outlines for the Jewish people centered in Jerusalem a way of hope toward the future. He does this through reading of history and midrashim traditional religious texts, and creating a Jewish world of thought of his own 
 This book contains alot of helpful information as well as errors. And...is this really a good way to organize your code???? 
 I have not always been a big reader, most books were so boring to me that I wished that I never had to read them (or force myself to read them). Accident by Danielle Steel was very different. It actually made me want to read, and I couldn't put this book down! It was amazing, I actually felt like I was in the story and I cried in many parts of it, sometimes my crying was out of happiness. I think that the accident in the story was a great way to bring out the truth of everybody's situation. It may have brought out the worst in them, but in the end it brought out the best. 
 Ackoff presents his organization design based on democracy and free market as organization principles. Most people generally believe democracy and free market are good principles for societies, while most business and government organizations have internal organizations based on autocratic authority and monopoly of services, resources and markets. Why does this happen?  Ackoff is very objective in his view of the corporations as social systems, which must satisfy their stakeholders. He presents very objective solutions for the problems of quality of working life, power and authority distribution, performance evaluation and control and structure design.    The title of this book promises a radical prescription, and that is a very good description of the contents. The book is dense with well thought, well developed ideas, with examples of their successful application!    If you have a position about democracy and free market you should carefully read this book, even if you don't agree with everything Ackoff proposes 
 A girl's dyslexia, relationships with a father and stepmother, and determination to investigate romance, cheating and death makes for a vivid multi-faceted story in Stay With Me, which follows her evolving sense of self in the face of disability and changes. Stay With Me is a recommended pick for mature teens who will find plenty of interest in a story of love which keeps on changing. 
 I just purchased this from Amazon and Im glad I did. It is one of the most enjoyable concerts I have had the pleasure to watch. The music of CSN is timeless and their magic is captured here for all to see. Buy it 
 I have done a little C and some FORTARN programming and I wanted to check out VB since I have heard that it was an easy language to learn.  It is and overall this really isn't a bad book if you have never programmed before.  The examples are easy and you are walked through them step by step.  What you are doing is also explained but only what you need to know to build the program, very little else.  But you are encouraged to explore the program on your own to get a feel for it.  As far as programming goes MS VB2005 really takes most of the coding out of it and you just have to add your buttons and text via drag and drop.  If you want to make simple programs this is a good start but you will definately want a (much) more advanced book if you want to do anything with any substance.  And should you want to move on to C# or C++ in the future you can still use this book.  I checked out the C# book in a store and with only a few exceptions it is the exact same as this, right down to the text and examples.  I was going to give this 3 stars but it does an excellent job of bringing the beginner with little or no programming experience up to speed to start writing simple programs, and it does it better than several other books I looked at.  
 I read this book the first day it came out and couldn't put it down.  At last there's a manual explaining how men think.  
 First, let's get the obvious out of the way. I'm sure the main reason the majority of guys are going to buy this is because of the shower scene. Let me just make one note about it and move on. The english version has an EXTENDED version of the shower scene. There is still one shot that's missing (just to be exact). However, the Japanese side of the disc does indeed have the UNCUT version of the shower scene. So feel free to go nuts, take screen shots etc. It is in here.  Now on to the rest of the review. This release is in everyway superior to the original US release.  It has the UK version of the movie (which is vastly extended over the US version) and the Japanese (completely un-cut).  The menu system is also a vast improvement (since the original DVD didn't even HAVE a menu system). The extra's, while sparse, also make it a cut above the original release.  The only thing I could possibly fault this release with is that it's only the Japanese version that's completely un-cut, while the UK version is merely extended.  Even that's not much of a fault. I don't typically watch my anime with the Japanese track, but with this one, I'll make an exception.   Once you see the Japanese version, you'll realize just how bad the english dub is. The dubbing team had to add to the dialogue to fit the mouth-flaps. This made for a lot of (for a lack of a better word) stupid dialogue that made some scenes go on painfully too long. It killed a lot of the flow of the movie. The original Japanese dialogue fits the flow of the movie better, and the voice acting is simply better.   While I may have actually grown to like KMFDM, Alice in Chains and Korn, thanks mostly to this movie, I can't deny that losing their music is a small loss considering how much better the dialogue is in Japanese.  A few notes on the movie itself. Yes the plot is paper-thin. But the fight scenes are what the movie is all about, and in those, Street Fighter II shines. There are a few parts with bad animation (crossed eyes being my major gripe). But taken as a whole, this movie is very well put together. It's well worth the cost. Stay away from the original US release at all costs.   
 Kenny Dorham was such a great trumpet player, but even considering the fact, that his recording period spanned about 20 years, starting with important contributions in the forties, when he played with Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and others, it quite seems, that he largely was taken for granted by the wider audience, which paid most of the attention to more glamorous players, namely Dizzy and Miles. But listening to Kenny Dorham's Blue Note recordings you will notice, that he had it all: A beautiful, slightly bittersweet sound, really nice, long lines and a great knowledge about chord-progressions. Of course, he also was a great composer. This latest reissue from the RVG-Series offers for the first time the possibility to really listen to all recorded material from that live-date. You will love it, especially if you already own the two Art Blakey CDs "Life at Café Bohemia", which also feature Dorham at his best. About the personnel of this date, I'd like to notice the presence of Kenny Burrell on some of the tunes. He had finished his first own album ("Introducing Kenny Burrell") just the day before and he sure was in a playing mood. the choice of J.R. Montrose is also a very interesting one. this relatively obscure tenorist really has nice ideas and a pleasant, light sound, somehow similar to Stan Getz or Zoot Sims and he really takes care of business. Bobby Timmons on piano already had his block-chord style, which later would become famous when he was part of Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Sam Jones on bass and the to me completely unknown Athur Edgehill on drums contribute everything necessary for a good groove, so let's say, that I really enjoy this music: The tremendous swinging versions of "K.D.'s Blues", "Night in Tunisia", "Who Cares", a very relaxed "My Heart Stood Still" and gorgous ballad interpretations of "Autumn in N.Y." and "Round Midnight". Considering the originals, I think, that "Monaco" is the most interesting one. It's based on an idea, which first appeared on another Dorham original ("Minor's Holiday") from the above mentioned Art Blakey date and Dorham's first Blue-Note Album, the fantastic "Afro Cuban", which I also reviewed. Enjoy it 
 picked this one up last week. chilling with some Kool-Aid listening to the Smooth Jazz takes on some of R.kelly's Many,Many,Many classics.Props&Dap to Everette Harp,Pamela Williams,Cuck Loeb,Chris Davis,Wayne Bruce,Rhon lawrence,Marion Meadows&Others. the Arrangements are cool. the background vocals are cool as well. it's  a Great Tribute to the King of Music. R.kelly's Music is Timeless&this is a cool Reminder of His Musical Genius from start to finish 
 This edition is not only easy to read and access, but is also updated with the latest information. I have found recent drugs easily and have added this book to my reference collection.  The drug listings are easy to use with both chemical and common names in the indexes.  A great Book and a wonderful edition 
 I cried when I read it and laughed when I saw the pictures.  They work so well together.  I have two little girls and the book really hit home.  It covers all the bases of girls; the soccer, the broken bones, the sleepovers, the giggling friends, the first date.  It is the sweetest book for girls and their daddys 
 This review focuses on the SACD remix of this timeless classic.  Presuming you already love this music and have wandered here looking for validation to purchase the music in the re-configured format, let me cut to the chase and let you know it sounds wonderful.  Some albums from this era use the rear channels sparingly to fill the room with swells and ambience, see Goodbye Yellow Brick Road for an example of this treatment.  Others like Dark Side of the Moon and T. Rex Electric Warrior give each speaker its own soundtrack.  Ziggy Stardust falls in the middle, giving plenty of separate treats for each speaker, but never hitting you in the face with the "tricky-ness" of it or detracting from the listening experience.  A great way to hear this great album 
 I enjoy this book and look at pretty regularly.  I plan on using some of the details on future construction projects.  However, the author is a bit too politically correct for my tastes.  She keeps reminding us how "poison" vinyl is.   That sort of bothered me.  I am sure, given a choice, most people would choose to live a beautiful wooden or stone home rather than a vinyl clad manufactured home or tract home..  however lets be realistic. Those types of home are often what is affordable to the average family.  Other than that issue.. I would recommend the book.. it has some great pictures and lots of information about bungalow exterior details.  
 "She was a weird, unkind, dissolute person." This is how her goddaughter remembers Patricia Highsmith, and after reading Andrew Wilson's biography, you may think so, too.   In Beautiful Shadow (a reference to the name of the fictional Ripley's home in France, Belle Ombre), Wilson follows Highsmith's life by following her writing, so by the end of the book, you'll have a long list of novels and stories to look for. He examines her influences, her relationships (romantic and otherwise), and her many quirks.   Highsmith was never very popular in the U.S., at least until the movie The Talented Mister Ripley, came out after her death. She was more successful in Europe, where fans even recognized her in the street. Perhaps this explains why she lived most of her adult life in Europe. She was never very comfortable anywhere, even in her own body, according to those who knew her, but she seemed less uncomfortable in Europe.  What sort of a mind comes up with the sort of strange, compelling stories that Highsmith wrote, with their amoral, yet sympathetic characters? Wilson goes a long way toward answering that question in this biography, but some questions remain unanswered, and maybe it's better that way.  
 I would strongly recommend that all readers on Amazon read the review whose title caption is ' Remember'. It is far more extensive and far better than the small remarks I am about to post.  Elie Weisel is the one human being who more than any other has helped the world understand the horror of the Shoah , the Holocaust the Nazi destruction of one - third of the Jewish people six million human beings.  For this he should always have a place in the historical consciousness of both the Jewish people and mankind.  His memoir is at times very moving .For those who know his other work and his masterpiece ' Night' there will be much familiar here, though here the story is enriched by greater detail.  I find myself whenever I am reading Weisel unable to really judge in abstract or purely literary terms. His significance as a human being, as a witness as one who has spoken to me in my own life is so great that my feeling is closer to reverence than anything else.  I read this book with the idea that any additional detail about his life and work, any additional understanding of his thought about Man's relation to G-d would be worthwhile. I read this work as I will read all his future works as an admiring student of a great teacher.  May he be blessed by many more years of great creative work. 
 I was priviledged to be at the Appalachian Studies conference where this mammoth work was unveiled, and it achieves it's purpose: it is a tremenous reference for all things Appalachian.  I first knew about the encyclopedia when my father was contacted a few years ago to author a few articles for inclusion in the agriculture section.  The editors have worked hard to find the most qualified people to write in every section- my dad grew up in Buchanan County, Virginia on a sustenance farm, and is now an agronomist who works for the University of Kentucky.  Every contributor is this qualified!  One note: if you are looking for an "introduction" to the Appalachian Region, this is not it.  This is more of a reference, reading this cover to cover would be somewhat comparable to reading the dictionary through, I would imagine.  If you want an introduction, go for "A Handbook to Appalachia", by University of Tennessee Press, or, for a less scholarly but quite interesting take, the Foxfire series.   When I got my copy of the Encyclopedia, I was very impressed.  I can't wait until I have time to sit down with it for a long while and simply browse through its pages and see how many new things I learn.  As an undergraduate researcher in Appalachian Religion, I look forward especially to reading the religion section as edited by Howard Dorgan (whom I luckily had the chance to meet at the conference), the premier authority on religion in Appalachia.    For all scholars of Appalachia, this reference is invaluable. 
 I wouldn't say that i love this album, but i love many songs on it. maybe mixing old funk tunes which sounds now exactly like the original was that good idea, but her ballads (Never Too Far & Lead The Way first come to mind) are just amazing showing off that she's still got her one in a world vocal range. and of course i just adore her Loverboy, wich is absolutely fantastic 
 This lady takes you beyond anywhere you have been with stylists - twenty plus years I still sing " Guess Who I Saw Today" habitually.  Nancy Wilson is one of my all time favorites! Cary Win 
 I had asked a few people about the album, and was told that "Dirty Little Secret" and "Move Along" were the only real highlights of the album, so I was a little skeptical. Eventually, I figured I would give it a try and I bought it. I found that all the songs were just as good as the singles, and I don't regret my purchase. If you were intrigued by the singles, then you'll probably be satisfied with the rest of the album 
 This book changed my view on what great literature can be. Previously I thought plot drove the reader to keep going - reading this I was driven forward by the beauty of the words that Winterson uses, sometimes not understanding, or paying attention to the action, often reading several times to revel in the flavours of her prose. I looked with regret at the dwindling number of pages as I approached the end, wanting to stay longer in the drunken, passionate language of this wonderful book 
 Just finished the paperback edition--which has maps and color pictures. A very good read in the manner of the best dogged English seekers after truth--what can we know about G.K. today? and what does he mean to present day Mongolians and Chinese? A good combination of challenging travel in Central Asia and educated weighing of evidence, with wonderful writing about places 
 I saw this on tv and loved it, so i had to buy it 
 I found the book refreshing and inspiring.  I think that parents often fall into the trap of being controllers and forget how to encourage the children to think for themselves, confident in the never-ending love of God.  While there are some concepts I may see slightly differently than Mr.Kennedy, I found the book helpful in my role as a parent of four and as an educator of parents 
 I recently read the 1 Peter commentary by Davids.  The text is quite readable.  He presents opposing viewpoints well and fairly.  He lets you know the likely best interpretation of controversial phrases and verses.  My only criticism is that I wish he had spent a little more time on 1 Peter 3:21.  Overall though, I learned a lot reading this book.  Despite the fact that I have read 1 Peter in the Bible well over 20 times, my understanding of that book is now greatly enriched.  You won't regret buying Davids commentary 
 Review Update: Completed all the recipes in the book, and am almost all the way through a second time My boyfriend and I LOVE this book.  If you love efficiency, you will too.  It's not gourmet - you probably wouldn't impress anyone with these recipes, but they're tasty, well balanced, and sooo easy.  The book just makes life simpler by doing all the planning for you - you know that every night, you'll have everything you need to make a quick, healthy, hot meal. I think we found about 4 recipes in the book total that we didn't like very much - and we simply modified them a bit and are now happily working our way through a second time.  Everything I said in my original review (below) is still true...we have a quick, easy, low-clean up dinner every night, a healthy home-cooked lunch every day and we've been spending about $3-$4 per meal to do it.   Original Review: Three Weeks In You need to try this book - it's fantastic.  My boyfriend and I have been using it for a few weeks now and can't stop talking about how great it is.  Every night, we make dinner, eat it and have all the dishes done within half an hour.  We pack the leftovers in tupperware and have lunch for the next day.  The best part is that we don't have to plan or make up shopping lists, and the food is (amazingly) both tasty and healthy.  Of course, there are a few dud recipes - I think in three weeks we came across two dishes that we didn't like very much, but we've taken notes on how we'll substitute something else next time, and are still really excited about the book.  Positives in our experience 1. We're saving a lot of time 	- No more planning or making up shopping lists 	- Shopping is a breeze- the shopping lists in the book are categorized 	- We honestly spend only about ten minutes every night on dinner (except Sunday, when it's just a few hours) 	- Less preparation = less clean up.    2. We're saving money 	- The meals are very well sized.  Because the meals are designed for four, we eat half for dinner and half for lunch the next day.  It's the perfect amount for us- no eating out, no buying lunches! 	- So far, we've been spending about $90 each week on the necessary food.  That's feeding two people, two meals a day, six days a week...not bad at all for healthy, home-cooked food, and that $90 also includes the money we spend on breakfast items. 	- Less impulse buying.  We know exactly what we need, so we don't end up buying things we never eat.  We go into the store with a mission, and don't stop to think things like, "well, maybe we can eat this later this week" 	- We have our shopping lists planned for the next 12 weeks.  That means we can look ahead and buy non-perishables when they're on sale, but only buy as many as we'll use.  3. We're eating well  Negatives: - Every now and then we end up with half a can of something left over, or something like that.  However, this is pretty normal when you're doing any kind of cooking.  Not a big deal. - The books calls for a lot of frozen/canned vegetables instead of fresh.  Of course, this is how you can afford to have quick meals, but sometimes it's nice to substitute the fresh stuff 
 Karen Robards did a good job of telling her story about a family in the deep south in 1769.  Most of us have little knowledge of the eveyday life during that time so Robards did a good job of researching her subject.  Religion plays a big part in the family life of a southern preacher.  His four daughters are who the story centers around.  Susannah is the key person who shows southern hospitality and sweet innocence in the matter of the heart.  The scene is ripe for her to be swept off her feet by a young dashing--reprobate.  Robards spins her yarn telling how these two opposites' paths cross and love blossoms.   This was a quick and interesting read.  It has a wonderful twist on the prince charming subject.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about southern comfort, history, sibling rivalry and the rags to riches theme 
 A must read for anyone concerned about the future of humanity  and the planet. Tells the story of Creation and the history of the world and the lifeforms that evolved here, from the  point of view of an eyewitness. Includes prophesies about   the future, as well as an explanation for why we have created  the mess we've got today. Will expand your world view and   leave you with a sense of wonder, a broadened perspective,   and lasting hope for the future. --L. Kashin 
 If you are looking for an audio version on tape, this is a fine option for this wonderful book. As you can see from all the glowing reviews, Wind in the Willows is a can't-miss classic. I bought the cassettes for a long car trip with a 5-year-old (we've read & re-read an abridged hardback) and while the story and characters provided much amusement for the full 10 hours, I was entirely sick of the narrator's syrupy voice and odd accents within 15 minutes. All that being said, if this is the only audio cassette version you can find, go for it. 
  In true "Christian Tradition" I am offering my personal testimony concerning Dan Barker's book. I read it when it was first released and I was myself losing faith in faith and leaving the Christian ministry. It was a confusing and lonely time for me, and Barker's book let me see that I was not alone in waking up to God merely being an adult version of a child's Invisible Friend. Barker is adept in enabling the reader to use their thinking abilities and see the Bible, religion, and "faith" for what they really are. In a nutshell, "The King isn't wearing any clothes!"   It was a difficult thing for Barker to abandon faith. From personal experience I know that it meant giving up friends, family, loved ones, career. Yet being free is worth it all! If you're a person who prefers comforting fairy tales to adult thinking, avoid this book. If you're mentally and emotionally an adult, this book is for you.   A five-star companion volume is JEHOVAH UNMASKED which is a fascinating Gnostic look at the real identity of the god Jehovah. 
 When I first got this book I had a minor interest in it, I thought it would just be an amusing read, but I loved it. I've always been ambitious and very goal-orientated but after reading this book I now have a different (better) perspective on things and it's helped me to relax. This book talks about how people like to achieve things just to boost their ego, even if it isn't what they'd really like to be spending their time doing. The title of the book sounds a little shallow and superficial but it's actually quite detailed about the points it makes - giving historical and modern day examples. Even if you don't agree with everything the author suggests (some things are not practical, but most are) it can still be an insightful and entertaining read.   
 "The Ritual Bath," Faye Kellerman's debut novel introducing the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series won the 1987 Mcavity Award for Best First Mystery.   Detective Peter Decker is called to investigate a vicious rape in a remote Orthodox Jewish Community in the California hills outside of Los Angeles. One of the women was brutally attacked as she walked home from the mikvah, the bathhouse where the cleansing ritual is performed. Rina Lazarus, the lovely young widow who discovered the victim, acts as an intermediary between Decker and the yeshiva, (a Jewish religious seminary), students and their families who are suspicious of outsiders.    Decker is also working on a case involving a brutal serial rapist with a foot fetish, who operates in an area near the yeshiva. It is a possibility that this psychopath, called the Foothill rapist, is the attacker. Or the perpetrator(s) could be a gang of teen thugs who have been responsible for anti-Semitic vandalism and violence in the past. And then there are suspects who are members of the religious community itself. From the first, it is clear that further assaults of a similar nature are more than likely to occur. The next incident, on the yeshiva grounds, is a horrific murder. As evidence accumulates, it appears that Rina is the psychopath's primary target.   Rina is a beautiful woman both outside and in. The mother of two young sons, she lost her husband, a brilliant seminary scholar, at a very young age. She is now in her late twenties and maintains the mikvah, as well as teaches mathematics, to support herself and her boys. She has not had much contact with men since her husband's untimely death, and although she and Decker are very much drawn to each other from the first, she refuses to involve herself with a man who is not an Orthodox Jew. Rina had a secular upbringing and chose to become an observant Jewess when she married.   The author deftly handles the workings of various intense personal relationships and crime solving with apparent ease. As with the other Kellerman books I read, her characters are her strength. They are truly three-dimensional and their dialogue is extremely realistic. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the humanity of the characters, and details of the Orthodox Jewish customs and lifestyle.   Her mysteries are solid. No loose threads are left behind. I plan to read more of this excellent author's work and highly recommend it to others.  JAN 
 This book covers all the ingredients for one to be successful. Andy Andrews covers all "things" that have been said before one way or another, but his rendition is both educational and motivating. His unique style makes it a must for anyone seeking harmony within themselves for a happier, more fulfilling life 
 Whatever reason guides our quest for information to discover small treasures, the rewards of finding writing as quiet and yet celebratory as Guy Davenport's OBJECTS ON A TABLE are immeasurable. This small volume of four essays on the intransigence of Still Life paintings and their concommitant relationship to music, philosophy, literature, history, poetry, and simply Life is satisfying on every level.  While the art world strains to design the NEW trends/schools/movements that will incite or induce controversy and a step toward the now ubiquitous Warhol 15 minutes of fame, writers and lecturers such as Davenport (and Mark Doty, Norbert Schneider, et al) offer solace in the simplicity of beckoning quietly toward the centuries old yet very much extant art of the painted Still Life.  Meditations on the significance of baskets of fruit, on 'memento mori', on non-visual artists who attempt to capture the simplicity inherent in the Still Life spill over the pages of this beautiful little book, and in doing so enhance our vision of the world about us.  The writing here is superb, the pleasures of pausing to read solitarily the thoughts of a writer so well informed about so many issues makes this small volume a fine addition to the thinkers' librairies.  Beautiful 
 I love the colors the artist uses and the simplicity of the geometrical  characters in this book. I think the story lyrics are good for young kids. Even though it does not follow the actual Biblical story it is enjoyable 
 An invaluable resource.  Starting with "What to Expect when Your Expecting" through the "What to Expect the Toddler Years".  Parent's should own them all.  As a first time mom, I consult this book at least once a day 
 My son (5 yrs) recieved this for Christmas. The neighborhood girls love to play it with him.  We also have sleepovers of 4 extra boys ranging from the age of 3 yrs to 7 years and they ALL loved it.   We put a heavy book on each side of the end of the track, like the directions say, and it works great. We also put a pillow in front/behind the door to keep it from moving.  These kids have gone so far as to make a cardboard target and place it so they can 'get points' each time it comes Zooooming down and hits it. We get big screams when the cardboard'ring of fire' is used and the car goes thru without hitting it(this comes with the set).  This elevator is a great invention.  The only thing I would change is the grey piece under the track that holds the end of the track up.  It often comes loose and the car will jump off the end straight instead of jumping up. I guess we will tape it until we get more track to add to this baby. Great FUN!  
 This is fabulous! I got this within 3 days of my order! its awsome! its comes with a black plaque-(bonus), the picture is misleading, it doesn't come with that strap thingy, but the plaque is nice. It really good for the price, recomended to buy if you collect this stuff, I DO!!! really good product, very detailed. i am happy : 
 Shocking and informative, this book is written with conviction and a powerful sense of wrong and right.  A must-read for anyone interested in end-of-life care 
 I like a lot big watches, and this Tommy watch is really great. If you want to get some special and not too much expensive this is what you want 
 We accidentally left this CD in a car we sold. We held out quite a while with our empty case, but whenever we'd hear one of the songs we'd tell ourselves, "We HAVE to replace that CD!" So we finally did. We are not typical buyers; we don't buy music/videos indiscreminantly, and do not have a huge music library. But this one, to us, is a "must have".. 
 Unambiguously, Garry Wills cuts to the heart of the gospel in his book "What Jesus Meant."  As in "Lincoln at Gettysburg" and "Nixon Agonistes" (my two favorite Wills books) the author looks at a familiar set of facts and draws startling insights.  In this book I was fascinated by Wills'- a former Greek professor at Johns Hopkins University - ability to draw insightful and nuanced meaning from his personal translations of familiar New Testament verses.  Like Jesus, Wills subscribes to no later day political as he explores the meaning of the "resign of heaven" promised by God's son.  Like Jesus, he speaks plainly and bluntly about power, wealth and even religion itself.  Able to be read in a single sitting, "What Jesus Meant" is sure to spark a personal internal debate over your understand of Jesus and the Scriptures.  Finish it and you will join me in thanking Wills for enhancing your understanding of religion's role in our society today.     
 'Free Rain' is wicked fun...nice down tempo with unique samples and cuts.  Just when I think Shadow Records are slipping, they drop albums like this and Saru's 'Downtempo Dojo'.  I will certainly be on the look out for future material from this outfit 
 A Touch of Zen is a magical film.  I have never seen anything like this before (or since).  A whimsical tale filled with vengence, redemption, honor and enlightenment.  Everything about this film is a wonder to behold.  King Hu wanted to make a movie that people will never forget once they saw it.  All I can say is that he accomplished what he set out to do.  Originally this movie was over six hours long. The studio forced him to edit it down to three hours.  To hell with "Crouching Tiger..."  You want to see a real mystical martial arts/asian zen film then this is the one!  However the DVD presentation is not that spectacular.  A classic like this one deserves better.  But despite it's flaws this is one movie you need to see!  Watch out for a young Sammo Hung, Yuen Wah and Yuen Biao!!  Highest recommendation possible, one of the essentials. 
 I love DC's ABSOLUTE format, especially how it lovingly showcases the body of work contained within.  It is grand to have this on the bookshelf and it's contents are indeed something to behold.  The only reason I didn't give this edition a perfect score is that I wish this omnibus also included both the two page Robin origin and the short Batman/Superman story which were originally published in Ross' MYTHOLOGY book.  Their absence really stings since they were crafted to fit in perfectly with the material of this collected edition 
 Its been a few years since I picked up a Heinlein but a few days ago I was going through some of the few thousand books that use more of my home than I do and found my old copy of Expanded Universe. I got my start on Heinlein when I was about ten years old, and sometime between ten and fourteen I picked up EU and then shelved it because the essays were not the action adventure and daring-do of Glory Road, or Tunnel in the Sky. The politics, philosophy etc. were lost on me at the time. This time around things are different. I've read some of the previous reviews of this work, and am frankly disappointed that people who claim to be Heinlein fans, to appreciate Heinlein, would be turned off by this collection. Heinlein was always more than the stories. He often made very little attempt to veil the personal philosophy and politics he put into his works, so it strikes me that any "Heinlein fan" who is turned off by this collection isn't, actually, a Heinlein fan as much as a fan of a good story (not that there is anything wrong with that... it just sells the old man a bit short). Not to say that RAH's politics are entirely my own. In this day and age I disagree with his ideas on nuclear policy greatly, however I understand where he was coming from. In a time when the threat of nuclear attack was a constant fact of life, and when one of the few reliable measures to prevent it was, simply, a matched set of H-Bombs on both sides that quietly said "No one will win, lets not do this at all", RAH was right.  He is still right today about patriotism and serving ones country in some capacity. The nation, the tribe, needs the service and support of its members to continue, there is no way around this no matter how many rationalizations can be offered up by the self-serving and the selfish.  Expanded Universe is a fantastic collection of fiction and non-fiction that gives the reader not only an insight into the writer, but a lot to think about. It gives the intelligent reader a window into the past, the reality, fears and hopes of a different time, and yet a handle on the unchanging facts and realities of the human condition. I have not enjoyed anything in my life as much as I enjoyed a quiet late afternoon sitting on my front porch smoking a cigar and reading from Expanded Universe. Give the poltroons their due consideration and then buy a copy anyway - If you are an intelligent human you should be able to find something in the works that will delight, surprise, intrigue and perhaps even educate you 
 Why would someone *LIE* and say that the picture quality to this DVD set was bad?! The picture and sound quality (for both films) is absolutely PERFECT! If you're a fan of Citizen Kane, or Touch of Evil, take a chance.... Open your mind to the next level of Welles genius! The Trial, in particular, will blow your mind with its avant-garde flare 
 This is an excellent book, with lots of important information about our three branches of government and how it was originally set up to operate. Lots of great info with which to arm ourselves to urge congress to recall some of the radical judges 
 I have one at work and now one at home.  Does exactly what you would expect with no issues.  Let me save you some grief though...If you are trying to boot from the floppy and need to set your BIOS to have the floppy drive first in the boot order, make sure you have the USB floppy drive plugged in before powering the computer and entering the BIOS setup.  If you don't the computer will not see that a floppy is available and will not give you the choice of booting from it.  Hope this helps 
 Jules Verne's _Journey to Center of the Earth_ (1864) is an incredibly imaginative work, enlivening a reader's capacity to draw mental pictures and dream impossible concepts in concrete, believable terms.  The German Professor Van Hardwigg, his teenage nephew Harry, and their stolid Icelandic guide, Hans, descend into the dormant volcano, Mount Sneffels, in Iceland at the end of June in the 1860s.  According to a centuries old Icelandic manuscript by the sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm--Professor Hardwigg accidentally discovers the manuscript--at exactly twelve noon the early summer light of June would reveal the correct path to take in the volcano.  And so, after a few overcast days, when it appears that the mission will have to wait another year, the explorers see their last glimpse of the noonday sun for two months.  Verne is brilliant at blending science, history, and art to make his fiction seem realistic.  The effect is that a has both a renewed interest in science and history while experiencing a memorable imaginative journey.  As the explorers follow false leads, despair of ever finding water and food, become lost and then found, and face unexpected, unreal dangers, Verne captures the sense of confinement of being underground.  For much of the early part of the book, the descriptions lack color and the reader almost must adjust his eyes to the light of the men's torches.  The center of the book, in contrast, like the near center of the earth, is beautiful, literally creating a new world within a world.     In terms of characterization, Harry expresses the explorer's angst while his uncle gives voice to the explorer's elation.  Upon seeing the extinct Mount Sneffels for the first time, Harry thinks, "To descend into the interior of a cannon when perhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of a madman."  (Harry's words will later ring true).  According to Harry, his uncle seeing the same sight "looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance."  Meanwhile Hans, the guide, is imperturbable, steady, and taciturn; he adds comic relief to the uncle's and nephew's extremes.  As long as Hans receives his weekly wages, paid on Sunday, he is oblivious to all danger.   Of the Verne novels that I have read, this is my second favorite novel, next to_ Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_.  There are two harrowing middle chapters, "Alone" and "Lost"--the sentence for the review comes from these chapters--in _Journey to the Center of the Earth_ which are unforgettable, and the conclusion of the book is ingenious.  The plot is unpredictable and clever.  Verne conveys the triumph and fear of the explorer during the nineteenth-century, a period when science became ascendant.    The book delighted French readers in the late 1800s--in fact, French children would eagerly look forward to Verne's latest before the Christmas holidays.  Similarly delighted, I read much of the book on my commute to work on the subway, and looked forward to it in the morning and early evening.  
 This book is an exploration of religion, politics, and psychology. A great read with historical significance (this was one of the books that sparked the 60's revolution), The Politics of Ecstasy will leave you with a desire to learn first hand how your own mind worships 
 I am not a Jew myself, nor a particularly religious person.  I come from an Iranian Muslim family.  This fact, in and of itself, would ordinarily be irrelevant were it not for the depressing reality that Muslim attitudes toward Israel are drearily predictable in their mendacity and barbarically ignorant racism.  Having already absorbed more than a few helpings of Islamofascist and radical leftist sewage on the subject of Israel, I found this book an immensely refreshing contrast.  Lozowick is not a "right wing" Israeli of the kind committed to the settlements (though even if he were, that in and of itself would not make him a bad person, especially given that even the most militant Jewish settlers still seem quite civilized when compared to the Palestinian thugs who would like nothing better than to "finish the job Hitler started.")  He is often critical of Israeli policies, and is willing to acknowledge the basic justice of the Palestinians' desire for political independence.  That being said, he does a wonderful job of exposing the truly grotesque hypocrisy inherent in the way pompous and self-righteous leftists, especially in Europe, present the Israeli-Palestinian struggle (and I will bet good money that every "one-star" reviewer of this book is either a neo-Nazi, an Islamic fascist, or a leftist, the differences between these groups being largely cosmetic).  These sycophantically pro-Palestinian Western leftists must rank with the most disgustingly absurd people on the planet. But for the fact that their mouths are eternally open in vitriolic condemnation of Israel, one might think their lips had been surgically attached to the rear ends of Hezbollah representatives.  Apparently, for some of our "bien-pensants," Jew-hatred is acceptable if it can be tarted up as multiculturalist concern for some "poor, oppressed people of color" du jour.  The fact that the "people of color" we are dealing with here are the Palestinians makes the hypocrisy of the Israel-haters even more nauseating, for if there was ever a people who have contributed mightily to their own misery it is the Palestinians.  When you BEGIN with the premise that the other guys, namely the Israelis, don't even have a right to exist; when your principal negotiating tactic is essentially reducible to the formula of "give us whatever we want or we'll suicide-bomb you into submission," then it is clear that your oppression is more self-inflicted than imposed from without.  Anti-Israel belligerents like to propagate the sophistry that Israel is the aggressor because she is militarily more powerful than the Palestinians.  But as any student of history can see, aggression is not a function of how many weapons you have.  It flows from hatred and the desire to do violence in the human heart.  When the Nazis marched into the Rhineland in 1936, they were in no military position to withstand the 100 French divisions on their border had the French chosen to respond militarily.  Militarily the Nazis were considerably weaker than the French in 1936; yet no one disputes that they were the aggressors.  So too in the Middle East, it is the militarily weaker Palestinians who are the aggressors, for they are the ones who teach their children racial hatred of Jews; they are the ones who glorify acts of terrorist murder.  For their part, if the Israelis want anything, it is to be left alone, and most of them would gladly give up the West Bank if the Palestinians ever became sincere about wanting only a compromise.  Indeed, the very fact that the Palestinians are constantly resorting to terrorism to pick a fight with the militarily superior Israelis is an ironic admission that the Israelis, for all their flaws, are immensely superior to the Palestinians not only militarily, but above all, morally.  If Israel's behavior even remotely resembled that of the typical Arab state, the Palestinians wouldn't dare provoke them in so barbaric a fashion, for to do so would be tantamount to inviting their own annihilation.  All of this is demonstrated very effectively by Lozowick, a man who nevertheless comes across as having more genuine sympathy for the Palestinians than in my estimation the latter have ever deserved.  And although I don't think Lozowick intended to place Israelis on some kind of pedestal, his book nicely illustrates the fact that a people, like the Israelis, can be far from perfect and yet still remain infinitely preferable to their morally Neanderthal antagonists. So even if you ARE a critic of Israel, assuming you have at a minimum a rudimentary capacity for fair-mindedness, try reading this book.  Unless you are a committed anti-Semite, or the sort of leftist buffoon who may not hate Jews per se, but who must always take the most virulently anti-Israeli stance as an oblique way of expressing your anti-American hatred, "Right to Exist" SHOULD challenge your assumptions.  If Lozowick's arguments cannot get through your skull, then short of a direct hit from a cruise missile I suspect nothing will.  
 ReChella did her thing with this book. I could not put this book down; it had me hooked from page one and then left me wanting more even after the book was over with. Charles, Charles, Charles..LOL He is a character that will definitely stay with you for the long run. Go out and get this book, you won't be disappointed! 
 Once i began to think of it as a "real-life fairy tale" i was able to really enjoy it.... think of it as symbolic and not realistic.  So artistic, creative and sweet, it will be one of my favorites for a long time. 
 This is a great book, which I would classify as a historical novel.  I read it before I went out to Gettysburg (along with all the two others in the series, which are just as fabulous).  I love the Civil War and work in archives cataloging many actual Civil War letter and artifacts.  However, to someone who was not too interested in the war, history or is younger this might not be a good book for them.  Nor is this book a supplement to actual research and factual histories. In the book, expect many reports about troop movements (war is 99% boredom, 1% sheer terror).  Expect lots of inner monologues, speeches, and flowery language because that is how it was in the Victorian era (it is the truth I have read enough letters to prove it).  I can say this book is one of the best historical fiction books I have read but it is not for everyone.  As for the movies based on this series, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, they have to be the most boring movies I have ever seen, just awful.  Read the book over watching the movie 
 i love mystery movies. especially dario argento's!  i have to say that this movie reminds me more of clockwork orange in atmosphere than of deep red and all..there are excellent gore effects for gorehounds a nice twist for you psychological killer enthusiasts. while yes, it is a great investment, i still think suspiria and inferno are far superior. this one deals with real life rather than dreamy moodscapes of the "witch" movies. swo if you get into argento via suspiria or inferno, don't expect them.     finally, what is it with this being out of print!!!  look at how much they are selling for? 121 bucks?!?!?  psssh..i say if you are going to get this, search ebay or some used record and movies stores..or you can even get some 30 bucks cheaper on amazon uk as of the time im writing this.  i personally say that if someone is selling this for over 75 bucks, pass on it.  just rent it and it will be back in print one day. it has to be re-released 
 My sons and I enjoyed this book. It is about Charlemagne, but written from the perspective of his eldest son, so it keeps their interest. This booked sparked us looking into Charlemagne in more detail, from the history books, so it was great 
 These are three live concerts recorded by uber fan Robert Quine at a few of the Velvet's concerts. The fact that these still exist despite the sound quality ( which isn't that bad really ) is remarkable and is probably one of those records that just has to be bough 
 I guess everybody knows Paul Desmond from "Time out" and from his composition Take Five. On this recording, it doesn't take much time to recognize his beautiful floating tone, his wonderful solos which are new  melodies by themselves, his "cool jazz" signature. On this repertoire --  mostly bossa nova tunes, plus a few standards -- Paul Desmond and Jim Hall  (on the guitar) rival of grace: their solos are full of twists and turns,  they never hurry and they both contribute to create a very relaxed  atmosphere. Connie Kay's drums add some sun to this session. Everything  sounds so clean and sweet! Though, they escape the tentation of playing  "too easy", thanks to their always surprising lines. The result is very  even and this is an extremely pleasant recording overall 
 With the recent and continuing shakeup of the dotcom companies, and the continuing rapid expansion of traditional businesses into e-commerce operations, Steffano Korper and Juanita Ellis' newly revised, updated and expanded second edition of The E-Commerce Book: Building The E-Empire continues to be an outstanding, "user friendly" source of information for aspiring entrepreneurs and business managers to the processes of sales and marketing on the Internet, including customer service, supply chain management, and the technology underlaying and making possible electronically based business transactions of goods and services. The E-Commerce Book is very highly recommended reading for entrepreneurs, sales and marketing professionals, business owners and managers, corporate executives, as well as the business school student 
 The Chronological Donald Vol.2 was the second box of my collection, after I happen collected the first one. The tin box contains 2 DVD9 look very precious.But the shipment made its had some ding. If you like Disney, you don't miss this treasures collection. The DVD content very classical and a lot of fun for your children 
 This is even better than the book and really helped my son, age 9 understand math relationships.  With all the "new" math around, it's a great tool to help kids understand why rather than method when it comes to getting it. 
 Book in great shape! Very enlightening how society is continually being duped by those in power with money. Scientific methodology can reproduced - that is its strength. Industries do not want marijuana legalized for it will impact profit margins. The reason the whole "marijuana is a Schedule A" drug like heroin is totally false. This book proves by scientific method and dispels all of the wild myths about marijuana. Look out textile industry 
 Keeps the ribs from searing. Lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib 
 How would you like to have to perform your own autopsy? That is the conundrum that faces Dr. Maura Isles in Body Double when she returns from a conference in France to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house. The investigation into the murder leads Maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before, and also leads Maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women.  This book moves quickly as Maura follows the investigation to its very surprising conclusion. It's a pleasure to see Maura team up with Dr. Jane Rizzoli-- Maura seems to take some of the hard edges off of Jane and Jane seems to make Maura a little less of an ice princess. This is an enjoyable book that you will find is hard to put down until the end 
 This book was a real surprise. If you are at all interested in problems solving and why we all so often make poor decisons, this is the book for you. It uses the results of the author's psychology research using simulation models, where people are put into complex decision making situations and the quality of the result analysed. The book documents the specific factors that go into making good and poor decisions. It is very easy to find oportunities to use these ideas in both my personal and work life 
 I'm a big fan of Mr. David and I have to say this book didn't disappoint.   I was a little put off at first worrying that the author had suddenly found God and he was just writing this novel to sermonize.   This is not the case.    The author needed to use the deeply religious main characters in order to make the story work.     Even though the novel is 500 + pages long, you get caught up in the story and end up reading  it at a roller coaster pace.   I was actually disappointed when the novel ended.     The only negative review of the novel I have is that he introduced too many side plots that went nowhere and they really didn't get resolved.     He packed so many story lines into the novel, that it might have been better if he had turned it into a trilogy, so that he could have hashed out in a little more detail the nuggets of great ideas.    Hopefully, he will write a sequel 
 I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.  I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.  Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive `readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.   Enjoy this book, and please don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 We invented Abraham Lincoln.  Not the man, of course, but the myth, that solemn and statuesque giant memorialized eternally overlooking the Capitol mall.  The power of that myth and the quiet dignity of its personage dwarfs us all.  But the myth is not the man.  Myths never are.    Stephen Oates in his _Abraham Lincoln, The Man Behind the Myths_, does not seek to diminish the man but rather to clarify him, separating the mythos from the mortal.  And it is not an undaunting task, it seems, for overly soon after Lincoln's tragic end the mills began to churn.  The public's shredding of the White House interior for mementos while Mary Lincoln lay debilitated in the next room seems symbolic of the wolfpack mentality in Washington even today.  And every new memoir published by another family acquaintance of the Lincoln's almost always got it wrong, and tore anew at the heart of the family.    We may not have memorialized and glorified our modern-day tragic heroes to such an extent, for we have simultaneously tried to scandalize them.  But the tabloid trade it seems has always been a yellow paper.  Even Lincoln was vilified in his time and after.  He was, Oates, reminds us, one of the most unpopular living presidents of our history.  But though the legacy ballooned to heroic proportions after his passing, the man seems to have been lost in it all, remaining only in the hearts of the family leaving quietly and unattended down the steps of the White House never to return 
 This is one of those rare movies that every actor nails their role and each performance is elevated by the performance before them.  Loaded with great actors and each character is unique with there own perspective on the goings on in the house.  No matter rich or poor, lord of the manner or servant there is a higher achy to both and gossip flows feverishly thou both as well.  The movie is very much like an Agatha Christy novel and really get immerse in the characters so much you almost forget someone got murdered.  Everyone has a motive and a reason to have done it and their is always one that didn't do it that wish they did, like someone beat them to the punch.  This is just a great movie to sit back a watch, not background noise but really watch and get immersed in the world and the lives of these characters.  one of Altman's finished works.  The film is set in the English county side in the 1930's and usually this means i steer away from, not a big fan of that combination, this time it worked for me in a big way and glad I came across this fine film 
 If "war is hell," as General Sherman said, then at the innermost circle of hell you'll find the 900-day siege of Leningrad (now renamed St. Petersburg). It was, by all accounts, the deadliest battle in human history. More than 300,000 Soviet soldiers perished, plus uncounted thousands of Germans. Inside the blockade zone, an estimated 1.2 million civilians slowly starved to death as Hitler and Stalin used the city like a giant chess piece on the Eastern Front.  The late Harrison Salisbury captured this epic struggle better than anyone else in "The 900 Days," a book every student of 20th century history should read at least once. He begins the story with Leningrad at peace during the balmy "white nights" of June 1941. Culture is flourishing throughout the city. Composers, writers, musicians and artists are busy at work. Families are vacationing on the Baltic coast. Meanwhile, Stalin and his minions are in a massive state of denial about the coming Nazi assault, despite dozens of warnings and signs.  After the first few fascinating chapters, "The 900 Days" can be slow going as Salisbury details the military intrigue and paranoia that decimated the Soviet leadership in the years leading up to the siege, which yielded tragic consequences for Russian defenses in 1941 and 1942. If you're primarily interested in the human side of the story, skip to Part IV on page 393.  The emotional core of this book is the immense civilian catastrophe that took place during the 2.5 year siege. Despite heroic attempts by local citizens and Young Communist brigades, the city became a slow-motion killing zone without nearly enough food, fuel or even fresh water to sustain the population. People resorted to the most desperate and barbaric measures to stay alive. (Warning: Not for children or the squeamish.) Compassion and brutality roamed the streets simultaneously.  Ultimately, the siege was broken in January 1944, but not before Leningrad was largely destroyed. Stalin gets much of the blame for failing to evacuate more civilians earlier on. But the real lesson of "The 900 Days" is that human suffering has no limit in times of war. Let's not forget that before we start another one.  Final note: This book is relatively short on maps, photos and diagrams. Some courageous publisher should republish the book with a complete set of photos from the period, many of which are available at the St. Petersburg library 
 I could not put this book down.  I think it is easy to relate to if you've ever had a female boss you didn't like.  Can't wait to read it again 
 Perfect for transport/traveling with my Garmin Forerunner.  Search for a good price as I paid $ 22.00 and also saw it priced over $ 40.00 at numerous locations 
 Like most of his books this is loosely based on Bukowskis real life experiences. Ham on Rye covers Bukowskis childhood and early adulthood, ending around his second year of college. Even though he had a pretty terrible childhood if your to believe this book he finds a lot of humor in some very horrid situations. I found myself laughing out loud constantly while reading this, so this is not some depressing whine fest. Even though its sad at times its also a VERY funny book. One slightly annoying thing is, even though he paints himself as the ultimate loser in virtually every facet of life he does not seem to be able to resist the urge to paint himself as a tough guy straight out of a corny Hollywood movie. Never losing a fight in his teen years, crushing an ape like college football player during a pick up football game, and even telling the ridiculously unlikely story of beating up a professional boxer in a backyard boxing match, even though he had never trained, been an athlete or even had a pair of boxing gloves on in his life! But besides that slight annoyance this book is a truly great read 
 Has there ever been a time when you tried to help someone by doing something you know is wrong? Handbook For Boys is about a boy named Jimmy who sells drugs to help his mother get on her own two feet. Later Jimmy is cought and has to go to court. Jimmy's mother doesn't have the money to bail him oht of jail so Jimmy is out of luck when Duke, who is the owner of a barber shop, walks in and says, "I will keep him for his time in jail to help me fix and clean up my shop." Jimmy's mother is okay with the deal and so is Jimmy. If Jimmy doesn't cooperate he will be in jail for a long time. Will Jimmy cooperate or will he give up and go to jail? I would recommend this book to anyone who tries to to help out by doing the wrong things.  I liked this book because my friend went to jail and had a chance to help a woman keep her house in shape. I recommend this book for those who try to do something for someone by doing something wrong.   Tarrel Desplains I 
 It is somewhat amusing to read reviews of fans critiquing the DiAnno years who only listened to the first two albums as an after thought.  I feel fortunate enough to have listened to Maiden before Bruce.  Actually, after getting their debut, Killers and Maiden Japan, I came across a bootleg of Killers Live with Bruce singing. The band brought Bruce in and did some live shows to see how things clicked and we all know how that turned out.  But as far as I am concerned, my favorite Maiden tracks are from the first two albums with Paul.  I loved the Punk sensibility that they integrated with stellar musicianship and the prominence of the bass. Basically it was punk with guys who knew how to play and how to play well and what they created was nothing short of amazing.  Some bands have been able to marry two completely different genre's well but never as well and lasting as the first two Maiden albums.  Long live Maiden!!! 
 Dove Shack's solo release "This Is The Shack" is nothing short of slammin.  It combines laid back G-Funk like the cut "Smoke Out" (with a nice, heavy bass and whiny keyboard synths) with smooth R&B as in "Summertime In The LBC," adding in bumpin, funky party tracks like "East Side Party," and throws in some harder gangsta flava for your ear in tracks like "Rollin Wit A Gang."  The album is well-rounded production wise, and the beats are awesome.  The album is prime for a top down ride down the AVE! There is something great about Long Beach; it has spawned yet another super rap act and album.  Too bad, these cats haven't released any more since this one came out in 95!  If you love the styles of Warren G, Foesum, Twinz, DPG, this is an essential addition to your LBC/rap collection 
 'Quantum & The Lotus' is a wonderful and lively read. One enjoys being the observer to a fascinating colloquy between a French Buddhist monk and a Vietnamese-born astrophysicist who compare and contrast the teachings of Buddhism with the latest theoretical understandings of quantum physics. Like most intelligent dialogues, it is an exploration and sharing of ideas, and as a result, one comes away not only with more answers but even more questions.   Comparisons to Fritjof Capras 'The Tao Of Physics' are inevitable, but this reminds me more of a little known film called 'Mindwalk', which is esentially a trialogue between a scientist, a poet, and a poltician. While I enjoyed that film very much, 'Quantum and the Lotus' is the exploration I'd hoped to see when I first watched 'Mindwalk'.  In 'Q&L', you see more ways in which East and West are coming together and interacting. We get a brief glimpse of science and spirituality co-existing peacefully and begin to see the outlines of how the two domains might even inform and nurture one another. It is another example of the Integral approach that is so needed at this time in the world.  The conversational quality of the text gives it a liveliness and spontaneity that often lacks in books of this sort. For anyone enjoys these kinds of books I would higly recommend 'Q&L', as well as, 'The Monk & The Philosopher, and the series of books from Mind & Life Institute 
 If you're really interested in the Banach-Tarski Paradox this book is what you have to read. The straightness of thoughts of Stan Wagon and his beautiful ideas not only about the paradox but also set theorie in general  were so impressing, that thi s book became one of my favourites 
 I thought this was a wonderful book. The tragedies in the young queen's life really make you sympathize with her and want her to succeed. She loses many friends and family along her way, and battles with inner guilt after an accident with her sight. I could not put it down the whole time, and fortunately, I had the sequel CHANGER OF DAYS ready to go. As the young queen comes home from her exile, she is greeted by what the oracle told her: a friend and a foe. The story picks up from there, and is a wonderful ending. I really liked how Anghara deals with Sif in the end, as well as the foreign king. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! It's an amazing adventure, and has the extra advantage of finishing in two books instead of three 
 Echo & The Bunnymen is most well-known for their 80's hit "The Killing Moon" (which was featured in the cult hit movie "Donnie Darko"). While this is a great song, the rest on here just aren't as good. Echo & The Bunnymen are clearly pretty talented, but the singer and the lyrics just aren't that good or interesting most of the time. None of the songs are bad here, thankfully, but they're not great either - they're all indeed catchy, however. Musically it's pretty standard 80's indie/pop rock, as there's little innovation to be found here. If you're an Echo & The Bunnymen fan then this is the collection to get, but if you're looking for great songs you won't really find them here. I would argue that "The Killing Moon" alone bumps this up to a "4" from a "3.5". This is merely a "good" (arguably decent) CD. Slightly recommended.  Highlights include: "The Killing Moon" the rest are good or decent 
 In my opinion, T.Rex is one of the most underated bands of all time. I also belive this is one of the greatest rock n' roll albums of all time. Next to Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, this is the most difinitive album of the Glam Rock era. Every song is great, and the extras make the album even better. Marc Bolan was a true musical genious, and one of the great forgotten artists. I would recomend this to any fan of old school rock.   HOGEY OUT 
 My kids love this book.  We found it while looking for "Go Away Big Green Monster".  It is a great opportunity for kids to put on the mask provided and tell what makes them happy, sad, angry, etc.  I was delighted to discover that each of them named each other as things that make them feel glad and loving.  I highly recommend it 
 I loved this book! I carried around a picture of my dream wedding cake for years and when it came time to have a baker make it for my special day, I interviewed 8 cake bakers/decorators and they all said they couldn't replicate it.  I found this book at Amazon, with my EXACT cake in it and with it's wonderful detailed instructions, a cake decorator was able to replicated it almost exactly!  I bought 2 books, one to keep and one as a gift to the decorator 
 I bought this book to get a better understanding of the Al-Qaeda movement, the Muslim religion and the politics of the Middle East.  Despite being a learned person in some areas, and somewhat knowledgeable in others, I must admit that I knew very little about the Middle East, its countries and history.  This book was a starting place for me.  It explained the birth of Al-Qaeda in brutal Arab prisons, the life of Osama Bin Laden, his growth into a rebel and then an extremist and finally to the lack of communication between the FBI and CIA which helped to lead up to the travesty of September 11, 2001.  I must admit that I would have to read it again to absorb all of the details, and I might.  Lawrence Wright has written an excellent well-researched and readable book, I highly recommend it 
 My kids love this book.  They are 3 and 5 years old.  This book follow the adventures of Jessica the frog who finds an alligator egg.  The other frogs tell her it is a chicken egg and they call the baby alligator a chicken throughout the book (the kids get a kick out of this - and try to correct me after they heard the story again and again).  Things good for kids from this book:  1) nature 2) use your imagination 3)explore the world around you 
 How to be Funny on Purpose is an outstanding book. It is a fascinating, one-of-a-kind book on humor. There is so much more here than a book on how to construct jokes, even though that part of the book is excellent. The first thing that catches the reader's attention is the author's command of the whole history of humor in America-on the radio, on television, and on the Internet as well.   Whether the jokes come from professional humorists, writers of humor, the author's personal life, politicians, or the humor found in everyday life, the range is broad, the selections entertaining, and the jokes are funny.   The second feature that readers will notice is the author's accurate, sensitive, and thorough dissection of humor. Willis's description of the three main theories about the nature of funniness-the superiority theory, the incongruity theory, and the surprise theory-and the examples he uses to illustrate these theories, is fascinating as well as simply and clearly explained. Willis writes in a plain, direct, and vivid manner that is both engaging and captivating.   Just reading about the forms of funniness helps one not just realize the world of humor in which we live, but understand and appreciate a whole new world of humor that we so often overlook or fail to be sensitive to. This book educates, instructs, and delightfully adds to your knowledge and understanding.   The third feature of the book that helps make it outstanding is its main one: how to be funny on purpose, or, the construction and use of jokes. Willis's approach to developing jokes is clear, specific, well-illustrated and explained, and contagious. If his information doesn't make you want to try your hand at creating jokes-as you are reading the book-I would be surprised and shocked. This feature, alone, makes this book worth purchasing. The suggestions for using the Internet to find and create jokes are instructive and useful.   I might add that once you are aware of how jokes are constructed, you will become a more knowledgeable consumer. You will know what makes certain jokes work and others fail. You will know, too, the circumstances when jokes should be told and when they should not.   A final feature of the book is important as well, and this final feature could justify buying the book just as easily as the previous ones. This is a joke book. It is full of jokes; there are some on every page. Even the joke considered the best one in the world, as well as the runners-up, are included. The beauty of the book is in the scope, variety, and selection of jokes. Willis knows classic jokes, and he knows what jokes merit that label. By reading this book, you will become an expert judge as well.   So, if you are interested in the history and background of humor, if you are looking for a thorough analysis of the topic, if the construction of jokes draws your attention, or if you just want a joke book, this is a well-written, expertly documented, serious look at humor. Willis offers a priceless book that is immeasurable in reader satisfaction, unparalleled in its approach and thoroughness, incomparable in its coverage of jokes, and, in my mind, irreplaceable with respect to its ability to educate and instruct. I will treasure this book forever, and it will be a permanent part of my library. Whether you are a public speaker or someone who would like to give better speeches, a professional humorist or someone who would like to become a better professional, or just a person who enjoys humor, like myself, or someone who would like to find greater pleasure in humor, you will treasure this book as well. It is first-rate 
 On international treaties right wing pundit Phyllis Schlafly wrote: "The principles of life, liberty and property must not be joined with the principles of genocide, totalitarianism, socialism and religious persecution. We cannot trust agreements or treaties with infidels".  Here Phyllis borrows the language of Muslim extremists but the sentiment is pure American Conservativism for the new century. The message is fueled by a belief in a messianic roll for America in world affairs and an exceptionalism of its people. The only good foreigner is one who accepts, without question, the American system of free-market Capitalism. Believing in the superiority of the United States lends itself to a belief in the inferiority of the rest of the world. On this level the author draws a frightening parallel between America today and Europe circa 1914 prior to World War I. It is out of control nationalism.  History shows observable signs of growing imperialism. There is a heightened level of nationalism and a belief in the superiority of the people as well as a feeling of persecution and emphasis on ignorance over knowledge. The author traces the anger back to the civil war and southern states humiliation after their defeat at the hands of the north. The Cold War only served to briefly constrain the seething anger towards Communists and perceived sympathizers but with the fall of the Soviet Union the floodgates of hatred crashed open. The anger has broadened to include all but the most subservient foreign nations while the core hatred is aimed directly at other Americans who are seen as illegitimate or abnormal. The feelings are amplified and justified by religious fundamentalism and its inherent intolerance towards diversity. Phyllis Schlafly is a perfect example of the rage that Conservatives feel towards everyone outside their narrow spectrum. Perhaps the most bizarre aspect is the right wings hatred of government combined with extreme nationalism.  The match that ignites it all is our own government gleefully throwing gasoline on the fire of intolerance. Conservatives have been working to foment a hatred of foreigners for decades (see `Freedom Fries') and now Americans are being encouraged to support imperialism under the guise of preemptive strikes and spreading Democracy. There is a tradition, in Conservativism, of venerating authority and a belief that often the `Truth' must be protected by a `Bodyguard of Lies'. The WMD argument in Iraq was the initial smokescreen followed by the tale of spreading Democracy. Meanwhile, Republican's lace their speeches with what the author calls `Black Magic' words like `Traitor' and `Freedom' with the intention of chilling debate.  The quality that has traditionally restrained the United States is a strong loathing of imperialism across the political spectrum. Morality maven William Bennett has advocated complete subservience to conservative leadership. As the author points out, people like Bennett move beyond even `my country right or wrong' into `my country is always right'. This kind of thinking creates a complete chill on international negotiations.  I wouldn't say I found anything completely new in `America: Right or Wrong' but I found it to be an engaging synthesis of the direction America has been moving. The author even suggests that some areas of the world like the Middle East could use more nationalism in order to bind the disparate groups and ethnicities within countries. The problem is when a fully mature and militarily powerful country like the U.S. gets in its collective mind a desire to reshape the world. In the end the author is betting on the self correcting nature of American democracy to regain balance. Hopefully he is correct. 
 Set in the early 20th century, this is Booth Tarkington's classic novel about the decline of an American family.  The novel won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize in fiction.  Major Amberson had established a family fortune by buying and selling land.  His children become social drones.  One son (unmarried) goes into politics.  One daughter and son-in-law wait around for their inheritance.  The other daughter marries Mr. Minafer, who has some success in business, but loses his money to bad investments.  The main story is about George Amberson Minafer, the only grandchild, who is spoiled as a child and grows up arrogant with the assumption that he is from an upper class family and will never have to work.  The family are large frogs in a small puddle and, alas, fail to keep up with a changing society.  They are left behind in the dust.  The people George Minafer looked down upon become successful in the new industrial climate, while George's family fortunes decline.  Eventually George finds he has to (gasp) find a job to support himself and an aunt.  The novel is slow reading, but is worth the effort.  Many students, unfortunately, are like George, and would probably not like to make the effort.  As a moral lesson, be careful who you insult.  If your fortunes decline, you may end up working for them 
 I've been a fan of the Corrs for years. Its a rare moment when I find I don't like a song by them. Caroline Corr has a wonderfully sweet voice, and the group's music is catching. Many of the songs feature the traditional, Irish sound of the Corrs that attracted me to their music in the first place. Here are some highlights of this album.  "Summer Sunshine" is just that--sunshine. Unfortunately, its too short, because its a great song.  "Angel" is lively and upbeat.  "Time Enough for tears" is a slow song, and not my favorite on this album. This is the only blemish on an otherwise perfect album.  "Borrowed Heaven" is hypnotizing and haunting.  "Baby Be Brave" is one of my favorite songs on Borrowed Heaven. Its upbeat and lively, and I keep playing it over and over again.  "Silver Strand" is the only instrumental piece on this album. It features Sharon Corr on the violin. 
 Overall, this is the best cookbook I've ever used.  Every recipe I've made is absolutely delicious, and for non-veggie eaters like myself, it is a God send.  This is because the book encourages one to try different types of vegetables cooked in different ways and with different sauces & accompaniaments. Don't be fooled though--while some of the recipes are quick and simple to make, some take quite a lot of time--all the better to savor the finished meal, however.  This book has truly taught me to enjoy the entire process of cooking, from shopping for the best ingredients, preparing the meal, then enjoying it with a nice glass of wine 
 I got this book from my local library after reading Alice's Tulips. Being a quilter, I am familiar with Dallas' love of quilts and history. I found this book very well written. A masterpiece of historical fiction. I was gripped and found it difficult to put the book down. I really enjoyed the format, it helped to anchor the book and draw you into Mattie's world. Definitely has its heart wrenching moments, so have a box of tissues near by. At first I was disappointed with the ending but upon reflection of the book I realize that it has the perfect ending. Maybe not what you would be hoping for but it follows the tone of the book regarding women's hardships and the tough selfless decisions women have to make, a suitable and understandable conclusion to a wonderfully written novel. I have decided to add this book to my library as I truly enjoyed reading it and would like to read it again 
 Good selection of songs in their full length versions.  These type of compilations have been in short supply lately.  I hope the record companies begin to see that these are worthwhile.  
 Amazingly funny. Incredibly physical. Written with precision and razor sharp wit. All of these accolades fit perfectly when discussing THE COURT JESTER.   Making fun of British royalty in the 1700s, Danny Kaye pulls off a stunningly funny and physical performance. Much of this appreciation, however, must be placed firmly in the laps of writer/directors Melvin Frank and Norman Panama. The dialogue is masterful and shoots from the characters in rapid-fire succession. The infamous "Get it. Got it. Good." as well as the unforgettable "The vessel with the pestle has the pellet with the poison" routine which will most likely have you wetting yourself with laughter.   The story, from the get-go, is light and intentionally so. We find young Hawkins (Danny Kaye) singing in the merry forest, pretending to be The Black Fox, a Robinhood-esque fighter against the royal crown. But Hawkins real job is to take care of the true heir to the throne, a baby born from royalty but saved from the slaughter of the now sitting King. And this baby has a birthmark on its royal bottom: the purple pimpernel. Hawkins job is to show the new recruits into The Black Fox's legions the royal bottom with this royal birthmark. But Hawkins craves more excitement, and he's going to get it ...whether its exactly what he wants or not.   Trying to find a way into the castle via back-routes, Hawkins, along with his beautiful companion, Maid Jean (Glynis Johns), run across someone known as "The Incomparable Giacomo," King of Jesters and Jester of Kings. He's on his way to the castle to be the King's new court jester. But Maid Jean conks him on the head and Hawkins takes his place.   But more trouble is brewing in the castle. Princess Gwendolyn (Angela Landsbury) desires a marriage of love and threatens to jump from the highest tower if she doesn't get it. The King wants her to marry a gruff and ugly German beast, but once Gwendolyn sets her eyes on Hawkins/Giacomo, she wants him. With the help of her hypnotizing consort Griselda (Mildred Natwick), Hawkins is snapped in and out of a dashing personality and back into his more mundane life so often it makes one dizzy to even think about it!  Giacomo/Hawkins is also supposed to kill off the King and his advisors in a plan devised by Sir Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), so that Sir Ravenhurst can assume the throne. Hawkins knows nothing about this, but his alter-ego/hypnotized Giacomo does.   Battling multiple personalities within himself, the love of Maid Jean, the advances of Princess Gwendolyn, the murdering schemes of Sir Ravenhurst, and his loyalty to the purple pimperneled bottomed baby, the story culminates as Hawkins battles the deadly German who's ten times his size in a show of knightly honor that is magnetic.  The Court Jester and much of its crisp and hilarious dialogue are still heard today. Truly a credit to the writers of this now 52-year-old flick 
 I was eagerly anticipating this latest book in Lashner's series about Lawyer Victor Carl.  I wasn't disappointed.  Those of you who have not yet met Victor Carl need to get acquainted with him.  He is rather a "smart mouth", and that trait gets him in some trouble.  In this book, Carl wakes up one morning from a night of drinking to find the words "Chantal Adair" freshly tattooed on his chest.  He has no idea how he got there nor any idea to whom the name belongs .  His search to solve this mystery, along with a case that he is investigating about a gang which stole a Rembrandt many years ago, are the basis for this book.  The two plots turn out to be closely related, and of course Victor solves them both.  The book is also great fun, with its quirky characters and Carl's irreverent comments.  
 Many reviewers have done a great job at eloquently promoting the principles of this book, I won't try again here.  Suffice it to say that if you are ready to become effective in the Lord's battle against Satan in the spiritual realm, this book may well change your life (Yes, The victory is assured, but the battle still rages.  Satan is serious about taking casulties.  Could there be any doubt?) It is no surprise this book elicited some negative reviews.  To even acknowledge there is a spirtitual battle in the world today in this age of enlightenment is not popular, including in many churches.  But denying we are at war does not change the fact that we are. I sure encourage you to read this book.  We need more warriors in the battle, and less commentators 
 This is a practical book that summarizes the most important aspects in the Music Theory, Harmony and an introduction to the Musical Analysis. The book is well structured and the explanations are clear and intelligible, for wich it is well adapted for beginners, teachers at college level, and also for those that, not being professional musicians, but they studied this matter years ago, they are looking for an a single-book-abridgment to refresh their knowledge quickly. It only lacks, from my point of view, of an appendix with the answers to the proposed exercises, what would help the self-students a lot.  
 the bad boy family are great but dis album just makes it even bette 
 The author grew up in a family haunted by the disappearance of six relatives during the Holocaust: as an adult, his discovery of letters written to his grandfather in 1939 sent him on a journey to locate the remaining eyewitness to his relatives' last days: a journey which would lead him across four continents and back to the small Ukrainian town of his family's origins. Much of THE LOST reads with the drama of fiction, but it's not: it's the author's own struggle to solve a mystery intrinsic not only to his own past, but to the world of immigrant Jews and Holocaust survivors alike.

 This book is great for the beginning player who wants to learn good strategy. Lots of great content. I liked everthing about it 
 Simply a great CD.  Virtually all of the tracks are quite good.  I've played this CD for about 4 friends thus far and each one thought it was great.  If you like a Hootie and the Blowfish meet Dave Mathews kind of  sound, you will really enjoy this CD 
 Sometimes you watch a film and it inhabits you.... it gets under your skin. Ballad of a Soldier is such a film. And sometimes a work of art provides an affirmation of what you've always believed. This too is the case with this remarkable, deeply moving film from Kruschev's Soviet Union.   The camerawork is exceptional, the black and white tonality is exquisite, and even though the tale told could be minimalized by labels such as corny and manipulative and obvious, at heart it's a classic story of love desperately trying to survive in the midst of madness. It's riveting - you can't take your eyes off the screen - and it's compelling, in that during this film (and for days after it) the most important thing in your heart will become the hero's reuniting with his love. Deeply moving... and I don't know if I will ever forget this performance by the shimmering Zhanna Prokhorenko.  The tragedy of this remarkable film is that it could have been used as an instrument to teach the American people they were being sold a lie by their government. That lie, endlessly hammered into our heads in grade school and junior high, was that "The Russians don't value life like we do."  We were taught to view the Soviets as grey, unattractive potato-like people in shabby clothing who wanted to conquer Main Street America, though it was never really explained to us why they would ever want to do that, especially after losing over 22 million of their own citizens in the last war... (oh I forgot, they don't value life like we do.) We were taught there was a missile gap...with JFK claiming that the Russians had thousands of missiles aimed at our back yards...  which we now know was an enormous and conscious exaggeration (sound familiar?)  If every American had had the chance to see this film in the early Sixties and had mustered up the inner strength to speak truth to power, the contemporary history of the United States and the world just might have been different. You could have shown this film to an audience of farmers and their families in Kansas in 1960, and that audience would have seen themselves on the screen. And they would have wept as they left the theatre.  The Soviet people were not our enemies. Their government definitely at times was our adversary, but the demonization of the Soviet people by our leaders and our media was and remains absolutely unforgivable, a historical sin.  A brilliant, heartwarming and sad film, with a profound lesson not too late for the learning. 
 I have read many Presidential biographies, and I rate this one right next to "John Adams" by McCullough. I only wish that when I was in school studying American History, writers like Brands were writing the history texts. They read like novels and I find myself wondering how a man like Andrew Jackson was only glossed over in history classes 
 This book is for those individuals who want to understand what is the "will" of God.  You hear at a death--"that was the will of God." You hear at a birth--"that was the will of God." You hear, you hear, you hear a lot...but no one seems to know specifically.  What is God's will for my life? Is it God's will I should take this job? Is it God's will I should marry this girl/boy?  This book walks you through these ideas and more and helps the believer turn toward the Bible for answers to these questions 
 This is an excellent book which will help you see beyond the simple "E" in P/E to the quality and sustainability of a company's earnings powe 
 Welcome back to the early eighties as "Lover's Lane" revisits the time when low budget slashers were all the rage. The film tells the story of a deranged, hook-handed maniac who escapes the asylum on the anniversary of his previous massacre to kill again. Intro the whacky teens who decide to party near the scene of the original massacre and you can guess the rest. "Lover's Lane" is an enjoyable romp into familiar horror territory and boasts good performances by the young cast as well as an appearance by Richard Sanders from WKRP fame. The film is not high on bloody gore but there are plenty of victims and chase style suspense sequences to ensure a fun time will be had by all. Gotta like that out of control ending as well. The only complaint is that the DVD's lone extra is the theatical trailer, a director commentary would have been a welcome addition. In all, "Lover's Lane" should be of interest to fans of eighties slashers 
 From a Nobel winner, you should probably expect no less.   This book is grand in its scope, & brings forth wonderfully argued cases towards what is an Indian experience from a socio-politico-economic perspective.   Sen explicates with sharp research India's tradition of heterodoxy, draws beautifully argued parallels between a argumentative culture & a democratic society. There are essays on Indian secularism, & its place in the world; the multilayered socio-economic structure of contemporary India where class, caste & gender intermingle. We also can see the deeply humanist, & still fiercely argumentative, Sen when he writes on nuclear India.   This is also a book of many surprising facts. Sen's deep research brings to these pages an amazing amount of knowledge, not apparent probably to the keenest Indologist. Though usually conclusive in all his essays, Sen is modest enough to say that certain problems require more research & erudition when he can't back his case beyond a point.   In style, this is not the easiest book to read. The sentences are long & complex, though never wordy. Moreover, because histories, cultures & societies are interrelated & this book is really a compilation of lectures & essays developed over time, you'll probably find a bit overlap between the content of a few chapters.   The only possible argument I do not feel very comfortable with is the repeated citing of Akbar & Ashoka & their deeds to exemplify "an Indian identity." I believe that for something to be associated with culture, it needs a critical mass. These kings were great human beings but their presence alone cannot rescue certain aspects of the Indian experience. We've had bad rulers in the land, & if what they did was not "Indian", why selectively use Ashoka & Akbar?  Overall, though, a most erudite & compelling read. I could not help thinking of Edward Said while reading this. Sen is as deep a humanist & as sharp a social critic as you are likely to find in the world today.   S! 
 Someone posted below that they don't receive all their issues.  I have never failed to receive an issue.  I suspect someone is making off with this person's copies.  This is an elegant magazine, worthy of Martha.  If they cover a topic, you will know all there is to know about that topic.  The recipes are little gems, and I like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved.  It's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world.  I do miss Martha's column of reminiscences, and wish that was back in the magazine 
 I had no knowledge or affinity towards NASCAR racing before reading this book.  The author makes the subject interesting to those of us who don't know the drivers, the car racing teams, the tracks or anything else about NASCAR.  It is a funny and at times hilarious read of one man's love with racing and the Winston Cup.  While not at all "high browed", one begins to understand the sociological context of this fast growing sport.  I recommend this book the fan, nonfan and the curious 
 This movie, 'The Apartment' is an American Classic.  Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine at their best.  A must for anyone who is a movie collector or anyone who just wants to see how romantic comedy was meant to be done.  Surprise ending scare that can only leave you(and apropriately so) with 'Shut Up and Deal' 
 I have given this novel to countless friends and relatives, particularly those who say "What should I read?"  Beautiful, lyrical prose that still tells a story (sometimes beautiful, lyrical prose doesn't).  I love the collective voice of the narrator(s) -- two sets of sisters, all cousins.  A masterpiece 
 This book is a follow up to "Later Days at Highbury," which is the story of Jane Austen's "Emma" told through the eyes of Mrs Goddard. She tells the story in a very interesting way: through letters.   Mrs. Goddard is a very minor character in Jane Austen's novel "Emma," but she is aware of everything that goes on in Highbury. She tells all the news and gossip to her sister. The book is made up entirely of their correspondence and a few letters from other characters.   Warning: this book does not focus on Emma or Mr. Knightly or other major characters from Emma!  Mrs. Goddard's life at the school and her students the main story here. One sub-plot is about Mrs. Pinkney (Mrs. Goddard's sister and her marriage to her husband) They live in London and run into the John Knightly's and the Eltons! Her husband has a niece who causes some trouble, as well as a scandal. What could the scandal be? Another subplot is about Miss Bates, who left town quite mysteriously and lives with the Churchill's. Is she happy there? You will have to read to find out.    Since Mr. Elton has left town, there is a new vicar. He is young and eligable! He brings a friend from school. So new romances are included in the book. There are plenty of unwed females for them to choose from. Whom will be engaged by the end of this book?  This book is such a delight. It is an easy read and you will enjoy the story through a lovely correspondence. It will make you want to practice the are of letter writing more often 
 This is a city full of history and the Encyclopedia of Chicago did an okay job with it. True I wish there was more about Mayors Richard J. and Richard M Daley, the book was interesting to read.It gives you a sense of life in this great city. Thanks neverthless to the Chicago Historical Society and the Newberry Library for their effort 
 not the type of books I usually read (poetry and all) and it took me quite a while to "get into it" but it was worth it. the story is multi-layered and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written. Highly recommended.  
 This has got to be the funniest, most warped show on cable today.  It's the ultimate show about nothing - a group of morally-deficient 20-somethings who own an Irish pub in Philadelphia.  They care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money.  They constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine.    To give you an idea of the show's themes:  there are episodes that revolve around one of the characters trolling for dates at an abortion rally; another in which the gang tries to outdo each other by pretending to be crippled, just to see who can get the most attention and sympathy from strangers; and an episode in which the gang charges people to view a "vision" of the Virgin Mary (actually a water stain in the bar).  The dialogue is made up of all the things people are thinking but won't say.  No tender or sappy moments here, these are episodes you would NEVER see on the Hallmark Channel or Lifetime.  One of the most unique comedies on tv, and by far one of the best.  I look forward to many more new seasons of "It's Always Sunny..." and am hopeful it does not lose its edge or pursue milktoast or nonoffensive story lines.      
 This album rules so much,  For the uninitiated this is a drone/doom metal album, it has no drums, vocals sometimes, but mostly just huge dark guitars feeding back.  It is terrifying, I described to a friend as sounding like "Satan bleeding to death inside of a volcano," if that sounds at all interesting to you BUY THIS ALBUM!! 
 What this book sets out to do is teach how to change from reactive, ego driven trading to trading in "The Zone" by using a preset system as opposed to trading based on your emotions and ego, which is very destructive to new traders. The book was a great complement to the other 20 trading books I have read. This one really drove home the importance of finding a system that works and then mechanically staying with it and not getting greedy or fearful and just start gambling. Your system should include stop losses to keep losses limited, when to take profits, and what indicators will give you entry and exit signals. This book is for traders that already understand the technical aspects of trading. The book focuses almost entirely on the beliefs and desires of traders that make them unsuccesful. The book recommends executing 20 trades using your system of choice in a purely mechanical fashion. This teaches discipline and takes out the guessing game. This gives you consistent casino odds as opposed to the odds of a gambler jumping randomly in and out of the market.The importance of working a consistent system is supported in almost all trading books.  The 5 principles of thinking in probabilities   1. Anything can happen 2. You don't have to know what is going to happen next in order to make money. 3. Ther is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5. Every moment in the market is unique.  I am a consistent winner because: 1. I objectively identify my edges. 2.I predefine the risk of every trade. 3. I completely accept the risk or I am willing to let go of the trade. 4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation. 5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me. 6. I continually monitor my susceptability for making errors. 7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them.  This review can not do enough justice to this book, buy it, read it 
 This is the single best soundtrack album I own.  And I own literally hundreds, and recognize more film composers than actors.  I remember watching part of the first season once, being mildly impressed, then forgetting about it.  I then obtained the season 1 soundtrack and was completely blown away.  Season 2 is better in every concievable way.  It's richer; there are more ethnic instruments in play.  It's better as a stand-alone; the music itself evokes emotion.  It's incredible in its complexity.  The highlights are:  "Roslin and Adama" - A beautiful series of chord progressions with a lead violin.  In McCreary's trademark brilliance, it is somehow sad and hopeful at the same time.  "Martial Law" - A short track with a chilling military brass phrase perfectly suited to its title.  "A Promise to Return" - This is used as Starbuck's emotional theme, and it's amazing 
 I was pleasently surprised with this latest work from Covey. It is outstanding, history explained and it is clear and to the point. If you are a student of the gospel and the First Vision this is the best I've found in twenty plus years. I have read it twice and am now reading with my wife 
 It was hard to read this book at first because of Kate Chopin's style of writing. But once I got used to it after a few pages, I really got into the book. The reader really comes to feel Edna's pain and want for freedom. I must give Chopin tons of props for having enough courage to write a strong female character and daring to use sensuality and lust in her book, even though it was written in the late 1800s (a time that even mentioning a passionate kiss on the lips in literature was forbidden). I got so into the book that I felt as if I were Edna living in a opressed world. Read this book to learn or get more knowledge on how women were treated during the Victorian Era...it is a must read 
 This book saved me when I has having chemotherapy and ended up with constant insomnia. I had not read about that as a side effect of breast cancer treatments until this book which has a good discussion of drugs usually used to treat breast cancer. I had read LOTS of books prior to my treatment and only this one mentioned drugs used to treat insomnia. If hadn't of known, I probably would still be staring at the ceiling ALL NIGHT wondering what the heck was going on!!! 
 It's hard to know where to begin with this one. A movie immaculately filmed by one of the greatest directors of all time, given just about the most perfect presentation I've ever seen on DVD. I guess I'll start with the print: it's magnificent, with beautiful, golden colors, sharp focus, and barely a speck of dust on the film. As one would expect with a Kurosawa film, the composition is a feast for the eyes, with beautiful formal balances coming from the most mundane of elements in a shot. (George Lucas was very influenced by Kurosawa in many ways, but this sort of beautiful, balanced composition is one thing he's never mastered.) Then there's the score. Most people might not immediately think of the score when discussing a Kurosawa film, but I was struck here by how powerful and distinctive it is, while at the same time it never gets in the way of the film. Then there are the sets: simple, yet used to maximum effect. This was not a big budget film by Hollywood standards (though it was the most expensive Japanese film up to that time), but it feels far more epic than any of the recent, very expensive Star Wars "prequels," which just goes to show it takes more to make an epic than just money. Kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen, yet you'll think you're seeing far more.  Then there is the cast. Tatsuya Nakadai, as Lord Ichimonji, manages to perfectly portray a man going man who is both frightening in his stubbornness and sympathetic in his pathos at the same time. Not an easy job, especially under a ton of makeup that made him look far older than he was. The three sons, played by Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu and especially Daisuke Ryu (as the insightful and loyal Saburo) are distinctive and well-developed. The androgynous Peter (first name billed only) as Kyoami is memorable for his flamboyant, almost drag-queen gyrations and taunting of the aging, increasingly senile warlord with insights into his predicament. Yet the standout performance, the one I always remember, is by the stunning Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede. While Ran is supposedly a loose retelling of King Lear, Kaede is more Lady Macbeth than anything else. She is in two very memorable scenes that both involve severed heads.  While the screenplay riffs on Lear, it also makes some notable changes. The three daughters are replaced by three sons. This "Lear" goes mad not because of a daughter's love but because, apparently, of the weight of wars fought in the past. The young Lord was very at odds with the image we see at the beginning of the film, of a man wishing to make peace with his demons. We discover through backstory that he has killed, kidnapped and waged much violence to bring together his kingdom, yet now he just wants peace and goodwill. I was thinking of the adage What goes around comes around, and wondered if Hidetora himself ever came to this realization. Is it what he was thinking as he emerged from the burning castle after a tremendous battle, dazed, wordless? That scene, shot without ambient sound but with that haunting score (composed by Toru Takemitsu), must go down as one of the greatest moments of film, and an example of how cinema can be used in a way no other art form can.   The bonus features are both bountiful and meaningful. First there is a full-length commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince, though I confess I've not yet listened to it. Director Sidney Lumet gives a brief appreciation of Kurosawa and Ran. He likens the film to the late Beethoven quartets or the Seventh Symphony. Such comparisons often come off as glib or meaningless, but this actually struck a chord in me. I indeed think the comparison of Ran's energies to the Seventh are apt, and the introspection reminds me of the late quartets, particularly Op. 132. On the second disc, we have the A.K., a 75 minute documentary on Kurosawa's life. (In case you've seen the recent PBS documentary on Kurosawa, this one is different.) Then comes a half hour film on the making of Ran, which shows what a grueling shoot it must have been, going every day to the base of Mount Fuji and often working there even at night. Finally there's a 35-minute video piece exploring the costumes of Ran, as well as a new video interview with Tatsuya Nakadai (Lord Hidetora). There's also a color booklet with interviews with Kurosawa and composer Takemitsu. In short, there's enough supplementary materials here to keep any fan of the movie or the director happy for weeks.   Many of Criterion's releases have defined what DVDs can be, but this title just takes the cake. What more could one ask for, short of summoning Kurosawa from beyond to talk about the film? Even if you own Ran in one of its other video versions, they are all vastly inferior to this release. And if you've never seen the film, or any work of Akira Kurosawa, this is probably the best place you could start. Highly highly recommended 
 I bought this book for the illustrations, but I found the story was just as beautiful.  My grandson who has just started playing the trumpet loved it, too.  In fact, he even made the effort to give me a call after he had read it to share his enthusiasm.  I will definately purchase more of this remarkable woman's work 
 Zorba is a classic, beautifully written. A picture of post war Crete, and a snapshot of unusual customs, beliefs and actions from another time. Not a great deal of action, and not a thirller but a portrait of a man and his struggle with his soul. The man in an imp, a heretic, a collosus - who just wants to be free. He is untroubled by the world around him, but he is concerned for those nearby. A thoroughly good read 
 My expectations for this book were very low, which might be why I found it so good. I had heard that this was her worst novel. but having read 12 of the other 13, I had to read this one. It lacks the complexities of plot and  character of her later novels, but the simplicity is not a weakness. It is  a gentle story of unexceptional people in a sleepy little town where  nothing ever happens - apart from the odd accidental death -  but Tyler  pulls the reader in through the front doors and makes us care. Joan and  James are probably too similar to several other early Tyler characters, but  the author keeps our interest up. These people might be dull to the outside  world, but Tyler shows us the spark of rebellion flickering deep inside -  hinting at the one big decisive act of their lives (this usually involves  running away from a big famlily - it happens in almost all of Tyler's  books!). If you are not a big Tyler fan you won't like this book, but if  you are, ignore the critics and treat yourself 
 In "Alexander Hamilton," Chernow has written a masterful biography.  Long overlooked as one of the most influential figures in the developmental stage of the Republic, Ron Cherhow tackled the task of sketching Alexander Hamilton's life superbly.  Unlike many of the other founders, namely Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, or Adams, relatively little has been writing about Hamilton.  Frankly speaking, however, Hamilton played as great a role in the development of this country when compared to some of the names listed above.      Chernow expends much energy elucidating Hamilton's very close relationship with General Washington which started during the Revolutionary War and extended up until Washington's death shortly after his presidency ended.  During his presidency and after, Washington both confided in Hamilton and took counsel from him, thus solidifying Hamilton's position as the foremost advisor in Washington's cabinet.  This fact alone elevates Hamilton to almost preeminent status.    Furthermore, Chernow describes the politics of the period, specifically how Hamilton's promotion of a national banking system and other Treasury functions led to the formation of the party system.  Most notably, a continuing theme throughout the book deals specifically with Hamilton's role as founder of the federalist party and how he constantly feuded politically and personally with Jefferson, Madison, and Monrow as founders of the Republican party of the time.    With regard to this topic and Hamilton's politics in general, Chernow has defended Hamilton much to vociferously.  Instead of telling the story of Hamilton's life, Chernow has taken on the ardor of an apologist.  For eaxample, during his life, Hamilton was repeatedly painted (either appropriately or inappropriately) as a monarchist by his political enemies.  Chernow has spent a considerable amount of space attempting to debunk this notion.  However, in the final pages of the book Chernow himself admits that Gouverneur Morris, Hamilton's eulogist, worried aloud in his own diary that Hamilton "was on principle opposed to republican and attached to monarchical government."  This is not to say that Hamilton did in fact harbor outright anti-republican and anti-constitutional feelings.  In fact, to the contrary, Hamilton's greatest fear on behalf of the new nation was a secessionist movement perpetrated by Republicans in the South or other politcally malevolent factions.  That said, however, from time to time Hamilton did express skepticism and other less-than-confident feelings with regard to the newly ratified Constitution.  Though he worked tirelessly with Madison and John Jay in publishing the Federalist essays in the New York papers, Hamilton did not share Madison's nor Jefferson's absolute intrepidity with regard to the document.    Finally, the epilogue of Chernow's book specifically covers Eliza Hamilton and her life post-Hamilton's death.  It seems entirely appropriate that the summation of a book about Alexander Hamilton is dedicated to his wife.  Here was a woman who ardently supported her husband even after he had been forced to sheepishly broadcast to the world his marital indiscretions with Maria Reynolds.  Furthermore, one cannot help but think compassionately of Eliza and her seven children as Chernow describes that fateful morning at Weehawken, New Jersey on the banks of the Hudson River.  Chernow's chapter on "The Duel" was supremely written and as captivating as any climax to any novel ever written.  Yet as I sat reading it, I could not help but think of Eliza and how oblivious she must have been to her husband's impending death.    Chernow's "Alexander Hamilton" is an incredible book even if it is interjected with somewhat less of an even-handed approach to the protagonist's life.  It is highly readable and flows wonderfully.      
 I've always looked at design books that showscase work from firms around the country and have always wondered: "What typeface is that?". I really love how in this book it actually tells you the typefaces used in all of the work. I also love the cover and the layout. If your in type and love graphic design, BUY THIS BOOK 
 In so much of the writing on computer security, Windows is given the short sell in favor of Unix security, so it is nice to find a good book that focuses on Windows, in this case with the latest server operating system. With 1000 page books written about Windows Server 2003, the system administrator can be quickly overwhelmed by all the new and enhanced features.  Danseglio cuts through this jungle and focuses on specific issues and implementation of security with the OS.  Time is spent explaining various concepts and how they are implemented in Windows 2003, often with step-by-step instructions showing where and how to find, set and tweak these settings.  There is some expectation of familiarity with Windows Server, but not necessarily an expert knowledge of how the system works.  You will not find all that you need to know about Active Directory, but you will find how to use it, and services such as the Group Policy templates to close security holes often overlooked and improve operations. Windows is notorious for its insecurity, and while Windows 2003 represents a quantum tightening of these holes (services such as Internet Information Server, are not installed by default) allowing you to prepare more thoroughly for using a service and cutting down potential attack vectors for users inside as well as outside your network.  This is not the canonical security book for Windows 2003, but it does serve as a great introduction and reference book for administrators looking to install and run this OS.  While the book was written long before Service Pack 1, the lessons presented here are still very useful. 
 This is a wonderful book.  It is fun to read about Mary Manheim's childhood and her career and the cases she has worked on.  The short chapters focus on particular cases she has helped solve.  It is sprinkled through out with stories of life in Louisiana 
 It is such a simple idea. Take a manual razor and an electric razor and create a hybrid electrical manual razor at a cheap price. Forget about buying any kind of electrical razor or manual razor again. This thing works using a single AAA battery (and is worth investing in some rechargable AAA batteries) which slips into the base by pulling out the end piece. Just press the green button and the razor starts to vibrate. This vibration stimulates the skin and gets those hairs to prick up a little bit so that razor blades (all three baldes, i.e - Mach III/M3) catch better creating a cleaner smoother cut. To be honest the old Mach III model was absolutely great but the M3 Power razor just upgrades that razor into a totally new device. There is simply nothing on the market that remotely resembles this kind of product... nothing. I would not hesitate in sending anyone down to the local drug store with a $20 to pick up this wonderful product that... quite frankly... just making shaving enjoyable again 
 Worlds Fastest Indian is one of the best "Feel Good Movies" I've seen in a long time. My friends who have seen it also agree. I highly recomend it to all ages. Acting is good and the race scenes, to say the least, are exciting. Gary W. Saa 
 First, let me begin by further defining the title of this rating. It truly is the perfect amp for a pair of speakers, "somewhere." Be it your desk, your patio, your hot-tub or your den, it will provide far, far more performance and quality of sound than any receiver or amp within it's price range and above.  The Audiosource website doesn't specify it, but I invalidated my warranty and looked inside and it DOES have a toroidal power supply, and is built with a very simple and direct approach. I am not an audiophile, but, hey the circuit boards looked uncluttered and as direct/simple as I've seen in audiophile equipment photos on the net. Plus it sounds amazing.  If you are holding back from purchasing the Amp One-A due to its price and are looking for an amp to power a pair of bookshelf speakers or zone speakers, I recommend this model 
 Any book attempting to handle such an enourmous subject as this is going to have a large mountain to climb.  There is so much to describe and many different ways of describing it.  I admit I was a bit skeptical at first, I didn't think someone with a background in journalism was going to be able to cover this topic in a meaningful way.  Thankfully I was wrong.  This is not a scholarly book and Lamb states this upfront.  However, this is not necessarily a bad thing as he is an excellent writer and the type of training he lacks as a political scientist is overcome by how approachable he makes the subject seem.  One of the biggest problems I have with books like these is that they tend to gloss over some of the more important details about U.S. actions in the region.  Lamb does not fall into this trap and didn't sugarcoat the unsavory things that the U.S. and Israel have done.  At the same time, he also makes no apologies for how most Arab rulers have used the Palestinian issue to benefit themselves while never really helping the Palestinians.  This book is refreshing in that it doesn't seem to favor any one particular group or country over another.  There were only a few minor complaints I had with this book.  This is an updated book and I felt that the newer sections Lamb added on were rushed and not much thought was put into them.  There's a noticable difference between the quality of these additions and the bulk of the book that was originally published.  Also, when Lamb ventures into analytical territory, like the section on terrorism for example, it becomes clear that this isn't the type of subject matter a journalist should really be writing on.  After reading quite a bit of more scholarly literature on terrorism, Lamb's contributions aren't really that helpful.  You'd do well to read authors like Graham Fuller for this material.  I think if you have an interest in the Middle East, but it isn't something you're going to devote a significant amount of time to, I would recommend this book.  The author presents a nice mixture of material that would be very helpful for someone that is new to the topic.  I've read quite a bit about the Middle East, and I still found this book to be a very enjoyable read. 
 Ably translated into English by Jeffrey Hopkins, The Meaning Of Life: Buddhist Perspectives On Cause And Effect was written by His Holiness, The Dali Lama for people seeking to develop a deeper understanding of Buddhist perspectives on existential questions of meaning, purpose, and responsibility. Basing his commentary on the Buddha's teachings of dependent arising, The Dali Lama reveals how every aspect of our suffering (unhappiness, pain, old age, death) is ultimately rooted in our misunderstanding of our own true nature. The Dali Lama infuses his text with the intelligence, wit, kindness and compassion he is so well known for within the Buddhist community world wide 
 "Your Course is Great! Back in the 80's I purchased the David L. Burge Ear Training Course and couldn't get passed the first tape.

 Of the many, many books addressing the subject of the war in Vietnam, this is certainly one of the better ones.  Mr. Spector is not only a good historian, but, just as importantly, a good writer and story teller.  I doubt that a person could read this work with out becoming, at the very least, just a bit emotional. The author, I think, has been very even handed with his assessment of the situation we found ourselves in at that time.  He does not appear to have an axe to grind, one way or the other.  Having served myself, I found the terminology used and the attitudes written about, to be pretty correct.  You certainly will want to add this one to your collection and I recommend it's reading very much.

 A Myth is not a lie, but, like Art, a rendering of Truth. Subsequently, religion is the extension of myth through ritual. Despite the titles, these texts are as much about religion as myth, and the works are all the better for it. Campbell skillfully explores the Human experience, and what Man has made of it, over the course of these four seminal works. At times, one feels the influence of Toynbee, but Campbell has gone beyond the author of A Study of History and into a world all the more full of wonder.  Man is the most conscious participant in Nature, and, as the Image of God, the only creature capable of reshaping Nature according to his own interpretations of its meaning. These little shapings, which we call art, myth, religion, culture, and philosophy are the stuff a rich existence is made of.  Stated simply, this work dutifully charts the progress, derivations, and points of origin of these shapings. Campbell's prose is warm, friendly, compassionate, loving but stern, and creative. One could not ask for a better introduction to the Man's works.  Occidental Mythology is the third in the series, and deals principally with Indo-European (Hellenism, Zoroastrianism) and Semitic (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) traditions. Through the thick swaths of these mythological histories we can make out a wonderful tapestry that ties the two together in profound ways while clearly outlining their differences. This is an essential work, as for we Westerners it clearly outlines who we are and how we came to be.  For those not familiar with some of the artistic themes discussed in this and other works, Campbell's Mythic Image (Illustrated Edition) makes a strong companion 
 The pendant was much bigger than I was expecting. It's very difficult to find an outfit that this necklace will go with because of the oversized pendent, I haven't been able to wear it much. The quality of the beads is good, the pendant is sort of plastic feeling but you have to touch it to notice. The cord everything is strung on is very cheap.  Nice peice if you really want to make a statement and no one's going to look too close 
 'Razorblade Romance' was the album that introduced me to HIM.  It is bar none their best album.  Song after song I cannot stop listening to this CD; it's intoxicating.  Ville Vallo's lyric writing was at its best for this CD.  My favourite song is 'Bury Me Deep Inside Your Heart'.  There is a cover of Chris Isaak's 'Wicked Game'.  'Razorblade Romance' is definitely an album every HIM fan has to own, and the album I would recommend to anyone who wants to be introduced to HIM 
 This was one of my favorite all-time books. I purchased one as a gift for my sister also. I love to read about other cultures, and this was an enjoyable read 
 While I DO love Scott Brand products...I don't think this package is such a great deal....this price works out to $1.60 per roll!! I thought buying in bulk was supposed to be cheaper?? You can buy a 4-pack for around $3.00, well, at least you can here in Florida! Total waste of money..unless it's necessary you buy in bulk. Maybe with the $20 off special it MAY be worth it? I'm in agreement with the fellow reviewers! Scott HAS changed (and don't you just hate when companies fix what isn't broke??) and their toilet paper now has a stiff,scratchy feel..guess that's why they came up with the Extra Soft version. And yes, it seems they WELD the start sheet to the roll now..I think they want you to use up half the roll just getting it started..to make you buy MORE and more frequently!! I think I'll pass on this "package deal"..I don't have money to FLUSH 
 I am a first order Canaphile (a person fascinated with anything Canadian) so naturally I devoured this book. I learned a lot about Newfoundland (and how it's actually quite separate from the rest of the maple leaf.) But most importantly, I learned about how a whole province can come together and lend a hand without being asked. It's the story of how people from all walks of life that ended up in the same place during a tragic time, and the people that took care of them.  Stories that may seem unreal to some people, like that of George, who just offered a ride to the nearest tavern (and later opened his home) to a group of Texans who were just walking down the road. Countless people opening their homes for a shower or just a few minutes peace. About the mother that invited a US National Security Advisor to her child's birthday party. It also talks about how other passengers dealt with their stranding. Like the chairman of Hugo Boss, the mayor of Frankfort, adoptive parents returning from abroad, and a very colorful prodigal Newfie. Some cried, all ate, and plenty drank enough to "embalm a herd of moose" as the author states. My favorite part of the book in fact was about the Screech-In ceremony which sounds like as much fun as you can have legally.   The author does an excellent job blending all these elements together, and really capturing the feel of a historic moment in time. You can sure bet I'm going to Newfoundland someday 
 Loved it. Highly suggest it. Couldn't put it down 
  A competent court officer sent to investigate the strange circumstances surrounding a prince's death finds the woman accused to be much more than he imagined.  The strange circumstances grow stranger as the man charged with her transport across country for delivery into the hands of justice discovers there is more to himself than he had imagined as well.  It seems that the difficulties surrounding this case will not resolve themselves easily; not without divine intervention and the revelation of ancient secrets.  This is the first of Lois McMaster Bujold's books I have read and I am very impressed with her writing.  You do not read one of her books; you enter her world.  The mythical world of Chalion.  In a few words, she is able to brush characters of unique human proportion in meticulous detail.  She sets these characters into swirls of political intrigue within this fantasy world from the Middle Ages and puts them on collision course with supernatural forces.  Of course it all leads to a romance of superhuman proportions and a clash of titanic spiritual powers.  Once you accept the theological construct in her world of five gods, and some may find this difficult, the story is both realistic and compelling.  She applies the spiritual fantasy consistently and with an even hand as in earlier books of Chalion.  This is not a book for the squeamish and some may be disturbed by the use of animals that is depicted, but if one cannot put evil into a story of good verses evil, then what is the point?  I'm not generally a fan of fantasy, preferring to keep my stories closer to the real world, but Lois has captured me as a reader with her use of description and subtlety and made me wonder about earlier books where she has turned her hand to other genres.  But Chalion, no doubt, requires further exploration.  I would recommend this book to anyone desiring to read for escape and great entertainment.  I would not recommend it to young readers or those not morally or spiritually well grounded, lest they try to bring pieces of that world back into ours.  Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield at stormbold.com. 
 Beautiful effect, smooth, long, elegant eyelashes, no clumping whatsoever. Lasts all day without running, and washes off with soap and water. And, the price is right. Frankly, I don't want to use any other mascara 
 I've watched this wonderful movie 2 times and still don't get it.  Was it all just a figment of the writers mind?  One of the reviewers brought up the major questions gone unanswered in this movie, so I would like someone who totally "get's it" to "spell it out" for me, please.  Were we just observing a story that was being written.  The waiter was killed "for the book", that's what Julie said.  Julie's mom's death was "an accident" said the daughter of the gardner.  Was there some mystery to that?  And, what was Julie's black out about thinking the writer was her mother and what was the end with the writer on the balcony in the kimono that wasn't hers waving to first the younger Julie with braces and then her face turns around and it's the sexy Julie?  Help me please.  I did enjoy this movie and gave it a 4 star only because I didn't totally understand it 
 In this short, readable book (in part an update of Tournament of Shadows), Meyer first provides some background on imperial competition among the British, the Russians, and the Americans in Southwest and Central Asia.  Subsequent chapters describe recent history in Iran, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and the Central Asian republics that once were part of the Soviet Union.  Meyer's writing is clear, lively, and well-informed; events are placed in context, and are illuminated with sharply observed detail.  While the discussion of issues is relatively light, this is an eye-opening introduction for those not already knowledgeable about the region 
 The worst thing about health research is that what's considered healthy today is considered bad the next and revised back to good the day after that. Mr Kowalski makes this a great book because he collates all the best research, summarizes it and in most cases gives a rational recommendation based not just on the research but on the results he has achieved. For the average person dealing with an average cholestrerol problem, I would highly recommend this book as all you need to learn what you are doing wrong and what you culd do to improve your  cholesterol measure

 I assume the plot of this famous tale is well known, so I won't spend time on it, but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade English class in the '90's, I was repeatedly struck by a piercing question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? Will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence? How does this happen, and is there ever an end-point to it? Dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection, yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense alone Charles Dickens has an Achilles heel 
 This is the seventh album from this amazing group but what is special about this recording is the fact that it is recorded in South Africa as the title states.   These guys are anointed in this Praise and Worship sector. The heartfelt lyrics are so catchy you can easily pick it up on the first hearing. This double CD has 31 tracks to take you through a journey of praise and worship. The album is packed with goodies that will uplift you on a challenging day and if you become self indulgent on these tracks your friends and family are sure to see changes with you.  Tracks like `Favour of the Lord' has a funky groove to it, `Turn It Around' reminds us that God is more than able to turn your situation around, `Not Forgotten' a dancehall Latino mix, Take Off The Limits' says God to us, `Surely' and `You've Been A Friend are love ballads to the Father, `Come And Let Us Sing' features Jonathan Butler a well known South African born Singer and Jazz musician. Jonathan Butler is the same musician feature on Kirk Whalum album.   Other musicians' featured on the album are Aaron Lindsey; Tommy Walker; Derrick Thomas; Melease Houghton; Pastor Hector Soto, Daniel Johnson the feature musician list just goes on and of course `New Season' is on the album too.  The problem with this album is that I wish I was there at the recording to experience first hand but it's all good really! A Big 5!!! 
 This book speaks to any age and all experience.  It's the perfect telling of a person becoming an unwitting hero not through action but inaction and understanding, at least, who he does not want to become.  
 Although this book is not of high quality literary-wise, it is very interesting. As a reader you get a realistic glimpse of how life in the Lithuanan Jewish gettho's was during WWII. I was shocked to find out that not only Germans, but Lithuanians and Poles too were involved in mass-killings of innocent people. 'The shadow of death' is a very suitbale titel, because that is exactly how the jewish people must have felt: living in the shadow of death.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR  CONCISE AND USEFUL INFO ON THE ABYSS (PLANESCAPE MATERIAL:(   I HIGHLY RECONMEND IT!!!! 
 This is a very good book about the Chechen War written from the viewpoint of the fighters. Most books on this topic are written by Liberals apologists for terrorism, who sympathise with the rebels and blame Russia for the terrorist acts committed by Chechens. Others are by extreme Conservative Christians who just hate all Muslims. Chechnya went from being a struggle for independence to a Holy Jihad. If you want to hear the real story from the voices of the Chechens, here it is! This book is easier to read then Wolves of Islam, and I reccommend reading both 
 I loved this book. I have been a die hard Steeler fan for 40 years, so I remember all the bad times & good times. This book was very well written, & I even learned a few things I did not know. I would refer this book to all my friends I relatives. Susan Prit 
 When I say compact, of course, I mean that it's not heavy.  It's the size of a normal mass-market paperback, but it has pretty much any word you'll need on a normal basis.  When I'm reading French internet articles or sitting down with one of the Harry Potter books in French, I can find just about anything necessary.  Once in a while I'll have to check my massive Oxford-Hachette, but this is really a steal at $6 
 Great book; very objective, almost a love feast of fascinating Buckley quotes, but also very critical. I recommend Mr. Judis' biography of William F. Buckley, Jr. as a great way to understand the course of American conservatism in the last century, going strong into this one 
 I bought this book for a workshop I planned to take.  It's unusual; I can't decide where it belongs in the scheme of things.  Since I have a practical bent, I enjoyed about half of it.  The other half was mostly "bull," kind of a history of plants, such as marijuana, the Irish potato, and the tulip.   
 if you remember the 60s and the james bond era,then this movie needs no introduction to you..its simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes.  for newer viewers,it may seem confusing. the beatles were at thier peak when they did this movie. they were the biggest thing in music no matter what anyone says. and they knew it. that comes accross to some viewers as they "just did whatever they wanted" and they certaintly did! the james bond connection will come once the newer/younger fan sees goldfinger or thunderball... the beatles themselves called this movie as it was..and excuse to enjoy anyplace or any plot they wanted. a must own no matter who you are..as long as you like the beatles. be open and enjoy 
 Now in an new and updated second edition, David's Truth: In Israel's Imagination And Memory by Walter Brueggemann (William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament, Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, Georgia) is a scholarly and informative examination of four different David texts. Professor Brueggemann accessibly offers a summary, interpretation, and blunt, unedited raw truths about the man and his era. A recommended addition to Old Testament studies shelves for scholarly studies, David's Truth is also highly recommended reading for the non-specialist general reader with an interest in Old Testament Studies in general, and biblical character and history of King David in particular 
 Einstein said something to the effect of "make things as simple as possible, but no simpler."  The authors of 3D-Negotiation have done just that.  They give appropriate credit to deft tactics at the bargaining table, but make a real contribution by illuminating the importance of setting up the optimal conditions for successful negotiation.  If you're looking for cheerful cliches about win-win negotiation, you won't find them here.  Nor will you find chest-thumping stories about winning through intimidation or brute force.  Instead, you'll get insightful analysis of complex business and diplomatic cases, all of which have a mix of competitive and cooperative elements.  Anyone who thinks that negotiation is only about who makes the first offer (or for that matter, who's adept at creating a trusting relationship) will get eaten for lunch by readers who master this book 
 This is an excellent book on the science of cooking, for those interested in learning the reason behind cooking.  If you want to a reference book for your cooking and baking, get this book.  I am sure this is in Alton Brown's library.  It is fascinating just to thumb through it and read various sections just for the trivia value 
 This book was great.  I read it to my cousin's children ages 6-8.  The illustrations are beautiful.  The children liked looking at the pictures which are very detailed and there is something new to find each time you look.  I loved that not only does the book show the number (1,2,3) but it is also in text (one,two,three).  We also referred to the pictures for a visual aid on what a group of that number would look like.  Not only will children learn the numbers in the numeral and text for up to the number twenty, but they will also extend their vocabulary.    
 I was read this book EVERY night when I was little.  I actually learned to read from my parents reading this book every night.  I identified with Frances because I was always the one who tried to find ways to stay awake, which I know kids are apt to do.  I know some people are going to be turned off of this book from the monsters in the closet (or the spanking), but for me, this book is one of the fondest memories I have from my childhood 
 Excellent translation. Very readable size font. Only 1" margin on outside. An inside margin would have been very helpful since text is two columns 
 After reading this book I came to the conclusion that it deserves four stars. I recommend this book for teachers and students because the information that this book contains gives us a better insight about students on a more intellectual level. This book will help both teacher and student to reach a higher level of understanding and create a better teacher-student relationship. John Holt also points out many diffrent problems in classrooms and how he as a teacher has handled all these problems.   
 After 50 years the little snippet heard on this site brings back the original emotions.I would love to purchase this recording in any format. The original performance, a life-changing event for me as a young girl, is  recaptured 
 I've have been working on an IPv6 lab and Running IPv6 is a great reference for setting up OS and router configurations.  Excellent material in a short compact format with no bull or filler.  I have to say this is the best IPv6 book I have read so far.  It is also the most up to date of the books considering all the RFC changes that happen for IPv6. If you are looking for something that is clear and to the point about how to USE IPv6 then this is it.  There are plenty of other books out there that go into the theory and design which might be better suited for studying (Joseph Davies - Understanding IPv6 or Regis Desmeules - Implementing Cisco IPv6 Networks) but if you want to get an IPv6 network running NOW then Iljitsch van Beijnum book is for you.  Kudos for writing a great practical IPv6 book. - Ed Horle 
 An Accidental Goddess is not going to win either Hugo and Nebula awards for the SF content or the equivalent prizes as a romance. But it is good fun.   Captain Gillaine Davre, or "Gillie", is a military advisor from a highly advanced race called the Raheirans to their slightly less advanced allies, the Khalarans. The Khalarans are themselves advanced enough to operate interstellar space ships and space stations, but both the Raheirans and a hostile race, the evil Fav'lhir, are so advanced that some of their abiliites seem like magic to the Khalarans.   The book makes frequent reference to magic: Linnea Sinclair appears to have deliberately allowed the reader to interpret these references in either of two different ways. You can take them literally, or assume that Raheiran technology is so advanced that it meets the saying by Arthur C Clarke that "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  At the start of the book, Gillie wakes up in the sickbay of her ship after a battle in which they have destroyed an enemy vessel belonging to the Fav'lhir.   It is a nasty shock to find that a side effect of the battle has been to throw her 342 years and 18 hours into the future. It is a much worse one to discover that during that interval the Khalarans have started worshipping her as a Goddess.   Gillie promply gets herself into all kinds of amusing scrapes. On the one hand she has no desire to be regarded as a deity, which she certainly is not, on the other she doesn't want to start trampling on other people's religious beliefs and risk destabilising Khalaran society by doing so. To complicate matters further, she becomes romanticaly involved with the Admiral commanding the Khalaran fleet in the sector - a man who worships her in a rather different way than she would have preferred.  There are all manner of logical inconsistencies in the book and things which are never explained. For instance, it is not clear why the Raheiran central government appears to have done nothing to replace their envoy to a key sector of the galaxy who was missing and presumed killed in action for 342 years. Nevertheless it is easy to forget about these issues while you are reading the book and just enjoy it 
 I will read anything that Spencer-Fleming writes, but have some reservations about the way the series is going.  I am becoming a trifle bored with Clare, who seems to have no particular intellectual interests and is always willing to show off her army training at the drop of a hat.  I like the introduction of the bishop, who, although somewhat of a caricature, adds some tension to the relationship between Clare and Russ.  Of course, the sensible thing for her to do is ask for transfer to another location, but people in love are not sensible.  At the end when Russ decides to tell Linda of their attraction (and that is all that it is for the moment) he is out of character and out of his mind.  Of course, Clare could solve their dilemma by changing to a Methodist, but that would be too easy!  So we wait for the next installment and the rising crime rate of Miller's Kill.  
 This book kept my interest from start to finish.  It is written on an adult level, reminiscent of an era when DC was still mysterious.    I'm a resident of DC, and this book reminds me of the Jimmy Stewart movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" not for the story line, but because even though this story was set decades ago, written decades ago, it could have been written today.  DC absolutely never changes.  Read this book for a higher-level "West Wing" from the congressional side.  Drugs, sex, affairs, power -- its all in there.  I recommend this book on the inside of DC -- and it is enjoyable for all -- Democrats and Republicans aren't mentioned, so it doesn't matter your party!  Enjoy 
 In my opinion the finest masters of saxophone today. A true followers of John Coltrane legacy. He just took it to another level. Every album features a new concept or sound. If you like saxophone, this is the choice. The only comparable musicians I can think of are Bob Berg or Bob Malach. 
 I am an adult and this looked like a good place to start....it was.  A good beginning, sorta like yer first year as a padwan 
 I just love beautiful love stories. A lot of the reviews say that this is "unsentimental," and I think what they mean is that it isn't maudlin. It's a book full of sentiment and emotion. It's also a nice read, and I enjoy books that have a great love story in them.   My book club enjoyed this one but, while we found some things to talk about, we all just kind of agreed on it and nodded a lot. Certainly nothing controversial that will keep your book club up at night. 
 Martin Lawrence is one crazy man. Anything he is or will be in is worth watching 
 Here are three amazing books, and one amazing saga, all together in one brimming volume you can throw into a backpack.    The first novel, "All the Pretty Horses" is one of the most beautifully told stories I've ever read.  Not only is the writing here packed with imagery, and the story one of McCarthy's most accessible, but the textures of the words used to describe the images are as lush and as enfolding as anything F. Scott Fitzgerald ever wrote--even when McCarthy's describing the driest of desert plains, the most desolate of ruins, or the emptiest of lives.  The book tells the story of two young friends who leave home in 1948 Texas to ride south into northern Mexico in search of SOMETHING.  What happens along the way is tragic and amusing, lovely and gripping, real and amazing.  McCarthy seems to paint every scene perfectly, yet he does so using the fewest amount of words possible, and the simplest of details.  "The gray and malignant dawn." "Stars falling down the long black slope of the firmament." "The shelving clouds." "Their windtattered fire." "Narrow spires of smoke standing vertically into the windless dawn so still the village seemed to hang by threads from the darkness."  Long sentences shroud the reader in the events of every scene, and the author's trademark quote-sign-less dialogue gives every conversation a very biblical feel.    The trilogy's second book, "The Crossing" has only thematic and geographical elements in common with the first.  The story deals with a completely different character, Billy Parham, a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family.  Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father's cattle but realizes he morally can't kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico.  Billy crosses the border into Mexico, and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams, where everyone moves as if the air was liquid, where every ruin has an irretrievable story, where soot and heat and danger hang in the air, and where nothing ever goes as planned.  The story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor, "All the Pretty Horses," but that's not necessarily a shortcoming.  The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south, east and west, across the present and into the past.  The writing is as good as any writing I've ever read ever, and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years.  For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth.   The trilogy's concluding part is "Cities of the Plain."  The book has some shortcomings, but it's still one amazing piece of work.  YOU try writing something this good.   In this book, John Grady Cole--the genius horsetrainer of "All the Pretty Horses"--and Billy Parham--the kindhearted nomad of "The Crossing"--come together as ranch hands on a New Mexico estancia.  Here, you can see why this actually is a trilogy.  Both characters are older than they were in the previous books--Billy much older--but both are kindred spirits whose stories connect with and affect each another.  "Cities of the Plain" tends more heavily toward the lengthy philosophical monologues that appear only occasionally in the trilogy's earlier volumes, and the whole story at moments goes a little bit long if you've just read the two previous books right before.  However, the writing is gorgeous, and haunting.  In one passage, a dead calf's "ribcage lay with curved tines upturned on the gravel plain like some carnivorous plant brooding in the barren dawn."  Yeah.  Yeah!  And the ending--the ending is amazing.  It might not be quite what you expect or ask for, but it is thrilling in its perfectness, in its completess, in how true it feels.  It gave me chills of ecstasy.  It left me holding the book like a priceless religious relic, re-reading its back cover, flipping back through it to parts I had marked, reluctant and unwilling to let go of these characters or their world.   Reading these collected books is like having a vision: I feel as if I should tell the world about it, but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe I should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me, into my life, into my head.  These are books that deserve readers.  Pick this volume up, and let it seep into your skin, let it open you to other worlds and people and ideas, and let it change you.  Let it open your eyes to the world, and to the West, and to the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us.  This is a saga made up of all those ineffable things that most of us just can't put into words.  But here, somehow, Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that.  Here is the intangible, but tangible.  Here is the unnameable, but named.  Here are the thoughts you could never express, expressed.  Here is a book worth reading, a book that will change you--you, and the way you see the world 
 Eric Hoffer prefaces this book by noting that it contains his thoughts, not proven theories, on mass movements.  After reading the book and seeing the many similarities he describes on the nazi movement, fascism, the catholic church, mormons, the American and French revolutions, I realized he may be on to something.  I am sure many will be upset to see that the nazis and catholics have a lot more in common then they do differences.  Thats not meant to offend, just to point out that both groups use very similar recruiting processes to grow the flock.  Knowing how a person thinks and what motivates them is a great way to get them to join your team.  His thoughts on the factors promoting self-sacrifice and the identification with the collective whole has hit the bullseye in my opinion.  I have never really understood kamikazes, or more recently suicide bombers, but now I have a clearer picture into their thought process.  If you wipe out the identity of the individual and get them to identify with the group, it makes it easier to get them give up their lives for the good of the group.  Pretty powerful stuff 
 Pain, passion, poetry in motion Rimshots has it all.  In stories and poems, Smith shows the range of emotions tied to the hearts of those who love the game of basketball.  The in-your-face color typestyles are  balanced by the sensitive sepia toned photos of the players.  "Don't  force anything, let the game come to you".  Basketball fans will want  this book to come to them.  Extraordinary effort for a first time author.  Simple and honest 
 I love this book so much! It is as much of a masterpiece as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. This is actually the most feminist Bronte novel and the most corageous in dealing with social issues. It deals with the evils of drink and with domestic violece in a realistic way. Yet it is a beautiful lyrical book at the same time. It explodes the Victorian myth of "the Angel in the House", and savagely attacts the 19th century assumption that women must be kept innocent and ignorant for their own good.  It is  the Bronte novel which was panned upon its publication because it so strongly attacked the status quo of the time and this maybe why she is to this day wrongly regarded the inferior writer of the three.   
 Alex Raymond created Flash Gordon as a full page comic strip on January 7, 1934.  The strip continues today, though only in reprint form, alas.  There have been reprints from Kitchen Sink (these are the best), Dark Horse, Comics Revue, and many other publishers.  Some of these are still in print, others can be found on ebay.  This book, from Checker, reprises the Kitchen Sink material.  The strip had its ups and downs, but most collectors agree that it was in its prime in three eras, the Alex Raymond era from 1934 to 1944, the beginning of a revived daily strip, by Dan Barry, Frank Frazetta, Jack Davis, Wally Wood, Harvey Kurtzman, and just about the whole E.C. Comics gang, from 1951 to 1955, and the Harry Harrison era, from roughly 1958 to 1964.  (Harry Harrison also contributed to E.C. Comics, and wrote The Stainless Steel Rat.)  It is good to see these strips back in print 
 Ah, the 1930s: "Japan annexed Manchuria and tried to conquer China, challenging Britain's position in the Far East. Italy seized Ethiopia & flexed its muscles in the Mediterranean, which, when Franco subjugated Spain, seemed in danger of becoming a fascist lake. Germany occupied fringe territitories, tearing up the Treaty of Locarno as well as the Peace of Versailles & upsetting the balance of power in Europe." "Statolatry," the worship of the state, lay at the heart of the matter. It wasn't the stock market crash of 1929 that doomed the decade, but (argues this author) governments' responses to it that engendered 'The Dark Valley' of the 1930s, particularly by the middle of the decade. The perceived panacea of state planning, instead of surmounting the turmoil engendered by 1920s stock market irrational exuberance, actually was akin to pouring salt on the wound. As "governments abandoned laissez-faire in favor of protectionism" "this encouraged 'have-not' states to create 'co-prosperity spheres' of their own, in defiance of the feeble League of Nations." In other words, "economic nationalism easily developed into political agression." Concomitant to this, propaganda was elevated to an art form. Said one participant: "And why do I insist on proclaiming that October was historically a revolution? because words have their own tremendous power." The words could easily be Lenin's, but are another coup leader's actually, uttered by Mussolini after his October 1922 seizure of power. The communists were no slouch herein, either, of course. The USSR had its show trials (after a 1934 state funeral for Stalin's potential rival, after Stalin had the later killed). And Hitler, all the while, was gearing up for war while denying it . But why did not "the truth will out" across Europe and across the sea? In Britain, blame the "moral paralysis" of the decade on Fleet Street's "habit of suppressing or 'playing down' unpalatable news." Witness how they hid the truth about Mrs Simpson's relationship with their king. "It helped to justify the newspapers' deceit about appeasement and the imminence of war," the author concludes. Meanwhile, the French were afflicted with a "Maginot mentality;" wallowing passively behind their wall, praying that it would protect them from Hitler; an affliction not at all helped by Neville Chamberlain's pacifism. (Neville was, after all, but one fine example of Theophile Gautier's maxim that one can pass through one's own age without seeing it.)   And "America further destabilized the situation by refusing to pull its weight internationally."  But it was Italy that takes center stage in this book.  Or, rather, it was the West's failure to confront Italy that emboldened the forces rising round the world to push their luck.  In particular, "The most fateful turning point in the period between the wars," (in historian B Liddell Hart's view, the author offers) was Britain (through the League of Nations) not calling Mussolini's bluff in 1935.  "Damaged by its impotence over Manchuria, the League of Nations, as many had anticipated, was destroyed by its failure over Ethiopia."  To boot, in 1937, not taking a stand against Mussolini because such could be "dangerous" (as Chamberlain argued) was akin to telling Hitler to sabre rattle to his evil heart's content.  In Hitler's own view: "The brown shirt would probably not have existed without the black shirt" (Mussolini's original fascistic stormtroopers). PS: This book has 76 pages of notes which is indicative of the thoroughness of Piers Brendon in this weighty tome.  (06Jul) Cheers!   
 Wow -- only five reviews for a uniquely priceless 400 page history of Buddhism in America?  Not to mention what's likely the best 12 page summary in print of Siddhartha Buddha's life and legacy?  Erudite American Buddhist author and old hippie character Rick Fields (1942-1999) left an enthusiastic storyteller's history that brings to life every remotely key player -- starting even far before the unforgettable English rogue scholar Sir William Jones (1736-1794) singlehandedly sent the first translations from the East to England and our American Transcendentalists.  Chinese Buddhist monks in Mexico in A.D. 458, the real kindly Quetzalcoatl?  If you think the history of Buddhism in America started at the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 and can be told largely through D. T. Suzuki, Jack Kerouac, Alan Watts, Shunryu Suzuki, Tarthang Tulku and Chogyam Trungpa -- think again.  Here is every gossipy thing you ever wanted to know and more about how and why Buddhism came to America, up to and beyond the Roshi Baker scandals (that mercifully ended the "silent denial of lies and abuse" and pointed the way to practice increasingly integrated with psychotherapy and more).  The author's note and acknowledgments are priceless in themselves.  (I confess to a long time habit of reading acknowledgments and indexes first.)  Very highly recommended 
 A great resource if you are looking to understand pairings of ingredients, complentary and contrasting flavors, building layers of tastes, etc 
 Authors Miller and Morris have nailed the impending transformation of R&D from its historical, product-centric past to its emerging knowledge-centric future. In addition, their focus on 'discontinuous' and 'fusion' innovation promises to lead the way for industry, in general, whose R&D functions typically produce less than one new product innovation per decade and whose new products, when they are produced, tend to fail in under four years. The authors' explicit embrace of knowledge management is also welcome, as the value of most companies now tends to rest  more on the weight of their intellectual assets than on so-called 'hard' assets.  Finally, this book's focus on distributed, enterprise-wide innovation signals the tearing down of R&D's overly centralized and compartmentalized profile in most firms,  and offers strong support for the view that innovation should be structured as a distributed, whole-firm social process, not an administrative one. I highly recommend this book to readers interested in R&D, innovation, knowledge management, intellectual capital, organizational learning, and sustainable innovation 
 My wife and I loved Old Man's War and Ghost Brigades - we're looking forward to seeing more books set in this universe. Great characters, great action, great science fiction... and without the pompous philosophizing or heavy moralism that seems to plague so many otherwise good science fiction works 
 This was an absolutely wonderful book which helped my family to see every interesting bit on the Oregon Trail.  Many sites were really off the beaten path and I'm sure rarely visited.  It was clearly written, fairly assessing the different sites and had very clear directions.  We are a family of 6 so the time allotted for travelling place to place was a little short, but all in all this book is a "Bible" for those who want to embark on this great trip 
 Okay if you are into a punk rawk disc then this is the buy for you.  Alot of fun songs with a christian message.  And even for people who are not christian this is an awesome pickup full of great lyrics, good guitar, awesome drums (go drums!), and sweet bass.  THere really is nothing wrong with this cd.  Best song of course is Punk Rawk show and teenage politics in my opinion.  I also have to agree with the review stated earlier, that is an awesome talent for this band to be able to copy BLink 182 when they came out before them.  FOR THE REVIEWER WHO WROTE THAT: MAKE A REVIEW THAT MAKES SENSE AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE CD NEXT TIME 
 I liked my Roomba, but love my Scooba!  Yeah, it's not perfect, but with two little kids and two big dogs, my house is never perfect.  There are a couple of places it gets hung up under our kitchen cabinets, and it doesn't get all the way into the corners, but generally it does almost all the hard work.  Our house has travertine floors throughout, and it takes a really long time to mop all of them by hand.  Now, I just take Scooba from room to room and let it go.  With the dogs, I was worried about dog hair clogging it up, and I do have to clean Scooba's brushes fairly often, but it does just fine.  (I use Roomba or a dust mop to pick up the big chunks before Scoobaing.)  It was a Christmas present to myself, and I love it, as does my (once skeptical) husband. 
 I almost didn't buy this book based on a review. So I am writing to say that this is the best book on vision I have read yet. Since I must have 10 or 12 such books in my possession, I consider this quite a statement. 
 I'm an employee with a small educational business, and I've started reading more business related stuff to get some perspective on how I can help our business evolve. I recently read "First, Break All of the Rules" and I picked this book up as a follow-up to get a different vantage point on growing a business. This study, completed in the early 1990s, focuses on 18 historically visionary companies that have built stable core cultures that can serve as role models for any business.  I greatly appreciated the historical perspective that evaluated the companies from their early roots. 3M a failed mining company? Sony building heating pads? Realizing how far rock-solid brands like this have come helps me to have some hope that a persistent, grounded organization can adapt to changing conditions.   I also value the emphasis on core values and presenting how these companies translate those values into a pervasive attitude throughout the company. Wal-mart and Nordstrom's are compared to "cult-like" organizations in a favorable way. Successful visionary companies not only have a vision, they find a way to attract employees who adhere to that vision and are able to "eject like a virus" any employees who don't match that vision.   This book, in contrast to many other business books I've read, relies heavily on thorough properly annotated sources. Even if you disagree with the author's conclusions you'll be pointed in the direction of some valuable published resources to assess companies like IBM and Merck for yourself.  My only concern with this book is the challenge of properly evaluating comparison companies and some of the visionary companies that look considerably less visionary in the present moment in time. The comparison companies are drawn from the time of the companies' founding. With companies like Boeing, this makes a lot of sense. With companies like Sony, this doesn't make as much sense to me. Sony has expanded into the music industry and technology industries successfully. I'd like to see how Sony's present comparision competitiors in industry compare on the visionary scale. Likewise, companies like Walt Disney thumped Columbia, which is now owned by Sony I believe. How does Walt Disney compare to some of its present competitors like Six Flags in the theme park arena or some of its competitors like Nicolodeon in the cable TV department?  The other criticism that some readers will have is that companies like Merck, IBM, and Wal-mart may not look as visionary in the popular press as they are presented in this 1994-completed work. The authors do speak to that concern in a later chapter and I accept their arguments for looking at the companies over 100 years and saying that, like Ford, they have the potential to return to visionary ways.  This book was real insightful, and I strongly recommend it to those who like some rigorous research with their business strategy advice.  4 stars  --S 
 What a great idea. 50 adventures that you can stick in your pocket and enjoy without looking like you are a tourist. I pulled out a few cards written about parts of the City I know and love to see if the author knows her stuff. Take card 15 - the Ms. Fay touches the high spots: Abingdon Square, Ottomanelli's, Zito's, Murry's Cheese, Rocco's Pastry and more. Walk these streets led by her map and prose and you'll have a wonderful visit. Flipping through the cards, I think every significant neighborhood has been captured. I know in warmer weather, I'll use a couple of her cards to explore Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens - boroughs that are a lot more of a mystery to me than Manhattan. Naturally, with a map on one side of a 4X5 card, there isn't much room left for text. Having said that, I wish we had more detail about each area - a small complaint. Maybe in V.2.0 some folded cards?   I collect anything NYC oriented and I am happy to add this pack of cards to my library but I wondered what the market is for these cards. My guess is that locals will use them to learn about streets outside their sphere. Out of towners will be able to stick one or two in a pocket and stroll through one of the most fascinating cities in the world. If you are a NYC fan, you need to get your copy of City Walks New York.           
 I liked this book because it was very fast paced and constantly kept me guessing.  Also the book kept moving along from one subject to the next, it didn't really 'stop to smell the roses.'  One thing I didn't like about this book was that even though it was a quick read, there was a lot it didn't explain, such as some of the science.  Altogether, I liked this book and recomend it to everyone!  
 One of the best compilations of all time 
 In this calm, lucid, and eloquent book, Profesor Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University describes and analyzes the evolution of the United States into the global Goliath we know today.  The book is not a partisan one: it is, rather, a clear explanation of how we got where we are today.  It is a sobering look at the future that all Americans, as well as our allies in Europe and Japan, should consider required reading to understand the world today 
 Tutti Qui is a "must have" for any Claudio Baglioni fan! It's a terrific collection of his music & shares with us his brilliance. It included all my favorites and gave me quite a few more, especially "Anna Belle Lee".  I can't get it out of my head 
 Form reading the other reviews, it seems other people thought it was too bloody, but if you know anything about Klingons you know the are a VERY violent race. I didn't think this book was that bloody. I've been following  Star Trek for most of my life and this book was one of the most accurate  I've ever read. And, of course, the other accurate books were also writen  by Diane Carey 
 THis book is amazing! Amy fleming's mother died and now amy has to run a farm called Heartland for problem horses along with her grandapa Jack, older sister Lou and the only stablehand Ty. Amy cured Lisa Stillman's horse and now she has sent her nefhew to help them around the stable and she is also paying for him to be there. Lisa is a famous Arabian breeder and makes alot of money. Her nefhew's name is Ben. Ben has a secert that Amy knows and isn't supposed to know or tell anyone. 't tell anyone she is not allowed to tell Ty which angers him and may leave Hearland to work at Amy's worst enemy's farm. Ben and Ty don't get along and since Ben's past has been rough Amy doesn't want to have to fire him and also his aunt is paying for him to be there. In the end they become happy and stop fighting, and telling lies but inbetween alot of things happen read the fantasic book to find out what. 
 The Brothers Karamazov is easily one of the greatest books ever written.  Unlike Crime and Punishment--which I also love--the Brothers Karamazov is more plot-drive and more easily digested.  A large book, it is nonetheless full of great writing, intense philosophical debate, and beautifully-crafted chapters.  'The Grand Inquisitor' is the most haunting and powerfully-written chapter I have read in any book.  If you abhor Dostoevsky's writing style, or his insisting Christian existentialism, then I wouldn't recommend this eight-hundred page behemoth.  If you weren't enamoured with Crime and Punishment, but did not hate it, I believe the Brothers Karamazov can bring you to the side of people who adore Dostoevsky.   Dostoevsky did not convert me with this book, but he cemented himself in my mind as the greatest novelist

     This was one of those books that was meaningful in large part because of its timing. I read this book when my daughter was one year old, and it just really rang a lot of bells for me. I was really trying to make sense of all I was going through - in terms of the process of motherhood, staying home with babies, leaving career, and abandoning my peer groups.  It was really kind of dark humor and a little depressing -- but appropriately so -- given the difficulty of the transition.   The first chapter was devoted to the process of preparing for birth, and her cynical observations combined with her own fear hit home in a big way.     Cusk's analysis of the roller-coaster emotions associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and new parenthood will resonate as truth among many new, and even seasoned, mothers. Highly recommended to all those who are seeking a thoughtful analysis of the process of becoming a mother.   
 A great book that realy got me reading 
 This CD consists of musical selections from the soundtracks of "Cal, Last Exit to Brooklyn, The Princess Bride," and "Local Hero" by Mark Knopfler finger-picking rock guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, best known as the front man for Dire Straits.   "Cal" and "Local Hero" feature Celtic influenced music; "Princess Bride" is lilting and classical; "Last Exit" features melancholy violins.  The best known tune on the CD is the "Local Hero" theme, "Going Home," which Knopfler used to play in his live shows.  The outstanding feature of the CD is Knopler's guitar playing which as always is complex and tuneful.    If the CD lacks anything it is majesty -- but none of these films was majestic, so Knopfler can be forgiven for not writing an ear-thumping "Lord of the Rings"-type theme. My wife calls a couple of the pieces drippy, but most are very good, a few beautiful, and all good, easy listening.   Smallchief          
 This film is a masterpiece - certainly the best cartoon I have ever seen, and one of the very best films in any genre - period. The film stars a family of superheroes - the Parr's - who are forced into hiding because of a series of ridiculous lawsuits (Bob Parr: "I saved your life!", suicide guy: "No, you ruined my death!"). The crazy fan "I know all your moves", who irritates Bob to the point of blunt rejection. The ejector seat - a spoof of the Bond Goldfinger movie. The evil madman ("Syndrome" - a set of conditions pointing to a type of disease!) owns an island called "no-man-is-an", and many other jokes. It is also fun to contrast the hilarious attempts of the family to blend in (daughter Violet: "normal - the only one in this family who's normal is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained!") with the dangers they later face. Bob longs for the days to be a hero again, and to see him contain himself is just hilarious, and yet sympathetic at the same time. Its interesting to see them develop in confidence, and learn to use their powers in new ways. Finally, I enjoyed seeing them learn to work together as a family - transitioning from the mundane (borderline dysfunctional) to a formidable team. The "Jack Jack Attack" short movie on disk 2 fits in with the main film, and is also hilarious. The early Bond-style band music also suits the film perfectly - and even outdoes it. It could appeal to some kids who have the attention span to follow a story, but I think it has more appeal for adults who can admire creativity and craftsmanship. Worth multiple viewings. Worth every penny 
 Many people think they learned Object-Oriented development in school or on their own, but most of these people are mistaken.  Here's a quick test - what is it?  If you said anything along the lines of "a way of programming ..." or worse yet quoted the four buzzwords, then there's a good chance you could learn from this book.  Object-Oriented development is most fundamentally a way of designing software, and as such a way of thinking.  One the design is done (properly), the programming aspects are mostly straightforward.  This book is the best I have seen at explaining that thought process, why it came about, and what benefits it can provide.  As a software development manager, I have recommended this book to numerous staff who were able to learn from it 
 If you're a serious tai chi practitioner this book should be in your library. Besides the invaluable knowledge it contains, this is just a very nice edition of the work. It's the only edition authorized by the professor's estate, and contains an introduction written by his wife, in addition to the translation by master Ben Lo. The cover painting of a white lotus and samples of calligraphy by Prof. Chen are nice touches, and the book is hardback and printed on higher quality you would get in a paperback edition. And the price is reasonable given the features and overall quality of the edition.  But of course the most important aspect of the book is that it's one of the most detailed books on the practice and theory of tai chi ever written. Tai chi is composed of three main parts: the self-healing, martial, and medical (or the ability to heal others), aspects, and prof. Chen discusses all of these at length. For example, he discusses the physiology of tai chi, and how chi is transformed in the body to strengthen the muscles, connective tissue, and even bones, in greater detail than I had seen before in any other book. Numerous tai chi principles and practical points are also discussed and illuminated. There is enough material and food for thought here to reflect on for a long time, and I found I spent much time just trying to absorb the basic points, let alone the more advanced principles.   The photos of master Chen performing many of the postures and techniques and their analyses and descriptions are also very helpful. There are 37 different postures in the long form, and each one is illustrated, and the external body mechanics, internal chi process, and martial application discussed and described. It's difficult to get all of that from a single static photo, which is why I say this book is really only for the intermediate or advanced student. (I note that the although some of the reviews here have been posted for more than five years, they only have a few votes, which leads me to believe that only the most serious students obtain and read this book, and look up reviews for it on Amazon).  All is all, a true classic of the martial arts by a great master that should be read and studied by every serious student of tai chi 
 I had to re-read pages as they made me laugh out loud! Stacey has cleverly captured the life of a single gal in the great city of Chicago. Lily is a loveable character.....self-deprecating yet confident....a real woman. I think I know her..... READ IT! BUY IT! And Stacey, I can't wait for your next book!!!! 
 This is the best bread book around, especially for the novice baker. It is clear, concise and detailed for the beginner as well as the professional baker. If you want to learn how to bake and enjoy the wonders of bread, this book will launch you on that adventure 
 I like anything by Ron White and this is a real page turner.  
 This cd is their most complex I think.  The first song, Svarga, moves from very sparse droning &  a reticent Persian violin to what is by far the most mind-blowing polyphony I've ever heard, & I have a large polyphony collection.  After that the songs are all so beautiful, each with its own thriving soul.  Vas is not Dead Can Dance, though.  They never will be.  The endlessly unravelling vocal harmonies of Azam Ali are a unique marvel.  Greg Ellis's adeptness on tabla & other drums is great.  The truth is the musical composition is more western than anything else, with worldly instruments & timeless energy.  Greg drums with a western rhythmic sensibility.  A great western rhythmic sensibility in their modern western music that's so unique in its themes & variations that it feels exotic.  From driving, but serene, hammered dulcimer to very sparing, dark, almost ambient music, this cd is most highly recommended 
 This review is being written as I am reading "The Presentation of the Self" for the third time.  And to put all my cards on the table: I read Goffman more out of necessity than interest.  This book is a classic for all the right reasons.  It is thoroughly argued, well-grounded in empirical examples, and offers a (at the date of its initial publication) truly original approach to the study of social situations.  Additionally, although Goffman's prose is a little thick, anyone can understand his argument.  He does not expect a readership well-informed in any particular social theory.   Goffman offers his own theory, drawing on theater as a rich source of metaphor, to explicate social organization and behavior. Although I personally do not find the argument very compelling, it certainly can't be easily dismissed.  This is the product of close observation of social behavior and organization in innumerable contexts, framed by a logical and rigorous theory.  Goffman makes what is, in essence, an argument in favor of 'social construction': Individuals consist of diverse sets of roles played out in different situations.      There are definite weaknesses with his argument, however.  To begin with the simplest: Goffman's prose, although he does not rely heavily on jargon (and provides adequate definition of any jargon he does use), does not make for a light read.  This is dense.  The examples are often clear (and occasionally entertaining), but Goffman's prose is stereotypically academic.    Secondly, although the book is full of empirical examples, many of these are based on observations of social situations that would not resonate with the contemporary reader.  This book is clearly a product of its time.  Readers might find some of the examples, or Goffman's glosses of them, offensive or just plain silly.    Furthermore, as Goffman himself states in the preface, his 'dramaturgical' perspective applies best to, and his examples are drawn from, "the kind of social life that is organized within the physical confines of a building or plant."  This is social psychology applied to a very particular sort of social organization.  While Goffman's theory may have applications to, say, the study of family structure, or intimate interpersonal realtionships, he clearly meant it to apply most directly to office places, service industries, royal courts and the like.  In other words, the dramaturgical perspective works best in explaining those situations in which performance is an expected part of the social structure (i.e., expected by the performers themselves) - but might fall short in those situations in which the aim is 'being genuine'.  Consequently, Goffman's argument does not necessarily demonstrate that individuals lack a 'core self' or identity. Goffman, however, suggests in his conclusion "that the very structure of the self can be seen in terms of how we arrange for such performances" as he discusses - in other words, that we are our performances, and nothing more.  It is easy to read into Goffman's work the suggestion that we lack core identities.  I do not think his analyses support that suggestion, however.     On this matter, compare Goffman's arguments to the philosopher Thomas Nagel's argument in "Concealment and Exposure".  Nagel argues that for certain social situations to work smoothly, we (as participants) need to 'conceal' aspects of ourselves (thoughts, feelings, biological urges...) that would disrupt that smooth flow.  Nagel does not mean that we do not have such thoughts, feelings, or urges; only that we must cover them up from time to time.  Structurally, Nagel and Goffman make very similar arguments: There are social demands placed on individuals such that we, effectively, have to 'act' out certain roles in order to maintain social organization.  But where Goffman stretches this insight to claim that the 'self' consists entirely of such performances, Nagel is able to reconcile a dramaturgical perspective on social behavior with the existence of an individual self.  (That is to say, an argument about how the self is presented in social situations concerns only the self's presentation.  It is not an argument about the identity of that self, per se.)      Finally, Goffman does not offer an explanatory theory - this is purely (although rigorously) descriptive.  Goffman refers to this book as "a sort of handbook", and it is; it is almost a field guide or crash course in social observation.  Of course, in social theory as in anything, clear observation and a logical classification of what we are observing is a necessary overture to explanation.  As such, this is not really a weakness, but Goffman's readers should accept that additional argumentation is necessary to account for *why* our performances are divided into front and back regions, etc.  On a related matter, Goffmanian analyses have been critiqued for being politically conservative; since they are heavily descriptive, they tend to take society as it is presented, with little or no normative judgment.  Take that as you will.  From my perspective, it is a weakness; others would certainly regard it as a strength.  All in all, this is a worthy read, whether or not you agree with Goffman's analyses.  It is especially important that those who disagree with Goffman should read this book; it has had such a tremendous impact on the practice of sociology that familiarity with it is a necessary part of any broad reading of social theory.   
 Gabriela Montero is a tremendous talent, both in standard classical repertoire, and improvisation.  I have know her since she was a young girl, and she was by far the best pianist around, even then.  She is an undersung pianist of our age, and should rise to the top very soon 
 This is a great book and I think everybody should read it.  It has funny parts such as when Pippi goes to the curcus.  She competes with the strong man and wins.  She's curious and always getting into trouble.  She has a monkey named Mr. Nelson and a horse that lives on her porch.  Pippi has mysterious treasures likes swords, music boxes, and weird rocks. She has friends that live next door named Tommy and Annika.  I liked this book because it kept me interested for a week.  
 I have been using the mac for adout 6 years. I pulled this out and felt like I learned every thing there is about macs. Now I am going to read The little mac OSX book 
 Pip is bottled up.  He has an alcoholic father prone to violent rages, a zonked-out pill-popping mother, and a little brother who looks up to him as the biggest hero in the world.  To escape from the pressure of protecting his brother from his father, Pip escapes in drugs and alcohol.  The narrative is told from Pip's flippant, jaded point of view , mocking authority figures and just trying to ease the pain of everyday life.  A concerned principal steps in to urge Pip to turn his life around.  Is Pip ready to accept personal responsibility and deal with his family issues?  Does he have the strength to avoid repeating this father's mistakes and treating his own brother like Pip himself was treated?  The book doesn't deliver any magic solution wrapped up in a nice little bow.  This is a powerful and realistic book about the pressures that teenagers keep bottled up inside. 
 The gourmet food industry is perfect for entry-level food distribution in this country: it lends to testing new products, it doesn't require large start-up investment, and it's a fast-growing industry. To enter, consult Food Marketing International president Stephen F. Hall's latest 4th edition of From Kitchen To Market: Selling Your Gourmet Food Specialty: it outlines and analyzes all kinds of food marketing opportunities for small cottage industries new to the business, discussing everything from building a product's concept using trade shows, brokers, and more. A 'must' for any newcomer cook who would market a product. 
 This is an extremely worthwhile CD, pricey as it was for me: the near-perfect performances by Murray Head and Tommy Körberg and an above-average score. I am in love with "Chess" in several of its incarnations, and this is an excellent recording, overall, from start to finish.  However, the fatal flaw of the recording is the fact that between Elaine Paige's accent and the heavy amount of Anglicisms in the lyrics, it's basically British, and that poses a problem when the actors are attempting to play American characters. 
 Claudette Colbert is brilliant in this fine example of Preston Sturges' work. Vaguely reminiscent of "It Happened One Night," this film features a notable performance by Rudee Vallee 
 The book is easy to read and very easy to apply.  The techniques are sound and can make a difference at your very next business exchange.  Highly recommended 
 This highly personal work is not only a delight to read, it is also a great textbook on writing poems, creativity, and word crafting using imagery. The book appears thin, but its 60 short chapters spanning 200 pages are jammed with creative ways to write poetically. These exercises interrupt your reading and force you to do (sometimes embarrassingly) creative things that unearth rich word details.  The author's approach to active creativity and her delightful exercises force me to return to this book often. Highly recommended for anyone who writes 
 Our family loves Tomie dePaola books, and this is one of his most beautiful. While I agree with one reviewer that it's not appropriate for two year olds, it really was fine for my 4 year old.  As that same reviewer writes, the book's heroine, a child, sacrifices the last tangible memory of her family.  However, this is shown as an heroic act of unselfish love--and her reward is that from that day on, the land is filled with tangible memories of her family's love in the form of the Bluebonnet flowers.  My four year old asked many questions as I read the story, and my answers--and of course the story itself--showed him how even a child can be heroic--and that heroism does not need to involve swords and muscle--it can simply take the form of an unselfish act 
 Betty Edwards, the author of Drawing On the Right Side of the Brain, has ventured into the world of color and painting with Color. Edwards demystifies color theory and brings it within grasp of just about any artist or designer. If you have had problems understanding just what makes up a harmonious color palette, then this book will help you solve that problem.   The book starts out at by explaining the basic vocabulary and works its way up to what makes a harmonious color arrangement. It achieves this with a number of exercises that are designed to give the student firsthand experience with mixing color and picking a palette. Though this book is written for painters, designers will get a lot of use out of it. In fact, I was able to do almost all the exercises digitally and got a good bit of benefit from doing so. I am a painter as well as a graphic designer, so I will be doing the exercises twice (once digitally and once with oils), but even if you are solely a graphic designer, this book will be of great benefit for you if you do not have a good foundation in color theory.     One of the things that I really enjoyed about the book was the numerous side bar quotes from famous artists and designers. We hear from the likes of Goethe to Itten. Though the quotes are not really needed for the text, it is certainly interesting to hear some of the greats talk about color.   The book's sub-title includes the word "mastering," but I do not think you will be a master of color after having read this book. However, you will have a firm foundation in color theory and will be pointed in the right direction to reach that goal if you put in the effort. So if you have always been mystified by color theory or never have gotten around to studying it, then this book is for you. You will come away from reading this book with a firm understanding of color and what makes  good color design. 
 My review won't be as fancy sounding as the others, but I'm here to tell you, this guy is right on the mark! After listening to his audio book, I started treating food like the addition it is (for me). Since reading this book, weight loss has become as much a mental diet as a physical one. He not only tells you what you need to do in a reasonable way, he tells you how to actually do it. Extremely practical. Very motivational. 
 This book was a wonderful read. It sounds like the author is talking right to you, and yet he does not talk down-if one is not fluent in hyperlexic english, they can still get a vocabulary boost. I cannot name one part that I most enjoyed, because I found the whole thing quite informative and at the same time entertaining 
 I highly recommend this cook book. I liked the diversity, the accuracy and the thought of representing recipes of each Country. In some of the recipes Mrs. Mallos had the same dishes prepared diff. and I thought that was interesting.  Grear Dishes.  Worth the money. I would liked to have seen more of the Jordanian and Palestinian dishes...but I cant complain 
 This is an unusually perceptive and sensitive view of the life and art of Georgia O'Keeffe. The author not only includes information about the friends of Georgia, but samples of the works that very probably influenced her development as an artist. The photographs of Georgia at various times in her life were a nice addition. I learned more about this wonderfully independent artist from this book than from the other dozens of books that I have read about her. Very readable, and highly recommended 
 This is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s.  It's an updated version on an old theme:  Save the young heroine from the evil, blood-sucking vampire.  Chris Sarandon (Lifetime Movie Channel staple) has an absolute field day playing the villainous Jerry Dandridge.  Amanda Bearse ("Married with Children") plays Amy, the young high school target of Dandridge's desires.  And William Ragsdale (a Hollywood newcomer at the time) plays Charley, the young hero who does his best to convince others to help him save Amy.  No one really believes Charley's rantings that his new neighbor next door is a vampire.  Charley's geeky best friend (played devilishly well by Stephen Geoffreys) doesn't believe him; nor does Amy.  Desperate, Charley enlists the help of has-been horror actor and TV host "Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer."  Equally desperate, Vincent takes the job as Charley's "savior" because he was fired as TV host and needs the money.  Roddy McDowall plays Peter Vincent extraordinarily well - first as an actor out to (wink-wink) "convince" Charley that Jerry Dandridge is NOT a vampire, and then genuinely terrified when he discovers evidence that Charley's suspicions are true.  Dandridge, upon meeting Amy, sees her unearthly resemblance to a woman he once loved.  He is immediately infatuated with the young girl.   But first, realizing his secret is out, Dandridge acts quickly to rid himself of the problem of Charley and his pesky friends.  The special makeup effects in this film are terrific and imaginative.  The script is tightly written and well acted and Tom Holland's direction makes it work.  (Holland's other works include "Child's Play," "Thinner," "The Temp," and "Thinner").  The DVD transfer is sharp and clean.  The disc features both a standard full screen version (4:3) and a widescreen version (2.35:1).  Sound is presented as 2-channel, Dolby Surround.  The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer.  Sub-titles are available in several languages:  English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  The disc is also close-captioned for the hearing impaired.  Specs:  Running time:  116 mins. Copyright 1985 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

 "Fires at Midnight" exceeded my expectations!! I initially did not know what to expect because I was not thrilled with the 30 second clips available to listen online. The clips do not do the songs justice. Granted you must have an open mind as this type of music is probably not tolerated by alot of people. This is an album that needs to be listened to several times and I guarantee you will find yourself singing along with the songs. If you were like myself and not all that familiar with Blackmore's Night; then I think this cd is a great starting point. Ritchie "plugged-in" more than recently for this album and the result is some very tasteful and beautiful guitar work. Standout tracks are: Written in the Stars-great electric riff; The Times They are a Changin'-nice remake of the Dylan classic;I Still Remember-guitar complements the haunting vocals beautifully; Fires at Midnight-great solo remeniscent of Ritchie's classic rock guitar playing; Storm; Benzai-Ten-nice oriental feel here; and there is also some nice acoustic pieces sprinkled throughout which are regrettably too short. I hope they continue more in this direction in the future.Overall a quality album and one that I have yet to stop listening to-all from someone who didn't even think he would like it all that much!! A very refreshing cd compared to the current state of music nowadays 
 some of the pics i have seen online, but thats only because i frequent dark garden's website. beautifully and tastefully done photographs. it has a small intro (about 3 or 4 pages) and the rest is photographs. i recomend any corset lover to have this book on their coffee table 
 In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll a young girl with the name of Alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her.  The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister.  She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it.  Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of.  This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of.  Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride.  I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting.  I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way.  This book is for children and adults alike.  As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world.     
 This is a mailbox album,if you know what I mean. I said the same thing for Julio Iglesias' 1100 BEL AIR PLACE. The only things missing are the geographical location and zip code. The cover photo looks like it could have been taken in Florida because of the palm trees. This is Eric Clapton's debut on the defunct RSO(Robert Stigwood Organization) label. Clapton got the contract with the label through the Bee Gees,whose manager was Stigwood and who would be Clapton's new labelmates. The album's biggest hit is I SHOT THE SHERIFF,a reggae piece by the late Bob Marley. LET IT GROW was also a hit. Both songs appeared on the compilation THE CREAM OF CLAPTON. All the other songs are good 
 I really enjoyed this book. True form of King. Rosie is a battered wife who get even with a vengence. But with the help of some friends and a picture 
 There is always something magical for the performers and for the audience at a 'well-done' live performance of music. A gestalt, if-you-will, or, a-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-it's-parts takes place and you may luck out and get to hear the best that the performers know how to deliver. This album is a compilation of several of those 'best ever' musical deliverances. Audiences in Europe, Canada, and South America are obviously attuned to this performer, and love him...and he gives them exactly what they want. The rhythms and grooves will pull you in!  
 this is the best scent EVER. its sweet, and heavenly..not heavy at all,,. it doesnt smell all perfumy more of a sweet clean candy smell..its delicious but mature not kiddie like some cheap walmart perfume. its great. and sexy.....YOUR MAN WILL LOVE I 
 This man has done many amazing things. C.S. Lewis never fails to amaze me! When it comes down to it, anything I pick up by him becomes one simple question, and that question is this. Where will he take me this time? Well, in this case, it happens to be a bus. And seeing as I've ridden in many a bus, there probably aren't any seatbelts, so you just have to hang on!  The Heaven and Hell concept, right? There is a Heaven and there is a Hell, rest assured. And even though this is allegory along with fantasy, don't fool yourself into thinking that it was simply made up. C.S. Lewis was always inspired! So don't be surprised when you see ghosts. If you ever read Lewis before, you won't be too surprised if this makes you think. Do we really ever think about what we say and do in everyday life? I'll tell you right now... I don't! Reading this really shocks you back to reality.   There is usually at least one part of each Lewis read that really hits me. This is no exception. I found this to be so simple, yet so amazing! Here's just a tidbit... "There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, "Thy will be done, and those to whom God says, in the end, "THY will be done." All that are in Hell, choose it." So also keep in mind when reading this, that you have and I have free will. We make our own choices, people.   Speaking of choices, whether or not you choose to read this is entirely up to you. I'd say you're missing out. But for those who haven't missed out know that this is one amazing read! On the backs of most his Lewis's books it says that he continues to attract thousands of new readers every year. It only took me about 27 years, but I'm glad he finally caught my attention! This man not only grabs the attention, he pricks the heart, and you just hold on for the ride! WOW 
 This Merk Edition is perfect for patients with limited medical background.  The explanations are more in laymen's terms but it would be good to have a medical dictionary to help when needed.  Most term are explained in the book and it is full of diagrams to help with understanding.  Merk recognizes the need for patients to become educated and have confidence that this is not a difficult thing to do.  Some doctors have led patients to believe for too long that the knowledge was beyond their comprehension, so nothing that they do is ever questioned.  I have met other doctors that explain in great detail and even draw on a bed sheet what they are going to do and why, giving the patient the respect that they deserve. I have a Degree in Early Childhood Education, and one crucial thing that was drilled into us that everybody can be taught anything if you start on the level of knowledge of the subject that you wish to teach. I believe this about children, and I certainly feel the same about every age level. Doctors are just people who went to school to learn.  You never know what quality of the knowledge is that they learned or if they have kept up with an ever changing field with updates from research all of the time. If you are particular about who watches your pet, you should be even more concerned about your health care.  Whatever depends on you to stay alive and for you to take care of, need for you to be healthy, and the health care of your loved ones should be a serious concern. It is easy to understand.

 Dr. Woodhouse explores our common paradigms, and offers brilliantly laid out views which we can adopt in the future. He writes to the common person, searching for an understanding of some of the worlviews and problems in society today. It is truly a eye-opening, and mind-expanding read that will leave you dizzy at the vastness of the scope it covers. Truly magnificent 
 I bought this book a year ago and have spent the past year perfecting my Persian cooking skills. With out Najmieh Batmanglij's wonderful book I'd be lost. The book is exquisite and replete with photographs, and wonderfully  yummy recepies. I reccomend this book to anyone--especially anyone  who  loves cooking. Ms. Batmanglij is truly a master chef as well as master  artist. I will buy her books for everyone in my family I reccomend you do  the same 
 For those just beginning to work with the Hebrew Bible, this little guide can be very valuable.  There is much in BHS that needs explaining, but is  missing or difficult to comprehend in the front matter of BHS itself.  The  material in Scott's book is available in more substantial reference books  on the Masorah ("The Masorah of BHS" by Kelley et al.) or textual  criticism (see "Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible," by  Emmanuel Tov), but these books are considerably larger and more expensive.   The latter may be particularly difficult for beginners.  As a quick and  easy handbook for navigating BHS, Scott's book is very useful 
 I have both lenses, the 24-105 4 L IS and the 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS. I have a 20D, but my wife and I decided we each wanted a camera to ourselves so I bought the 24-105 lens along with the 30D about 2 months ago.  I was so sure that I'd see a big difference with the L lens since my 70-200 2.8 IS L is such a superior lens. The thing is, I can't justify it.  I've set the camera on a tripod and switched the lenses back and forth taking pictures with identical light and settings on a variety of subjects.  (They both take extremely nice pictures)  Maybe with a full frame sensor the difference would be apparent.  At this point I like the extra reach of the 135mm.  I'll let my wife use the $1200 L lens. My recommendation is: for the money on a cropped sensor camera I'd stick with the 28-135 lens 
 Basic and Clinical Endocrinology provides the basics needed for a medical school endocrinology unit. By purchasing this book, a medical student is able to focus on the endocrine system in great detail 
 This was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day.  This was also my first Crichton, and I have to say I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Easy to read adventure novel 
 When I decided to take the plunge and put together my web site, I selected Dreamweaver for the software. I than ordered Dreamweaver for Dummies, because I wanted an introduction to web development that was structured to presented the material in a straight forward, clear and concise manor and did not assume that I had prior experience.  The book met all of my expectations and made learning Dreamweaver a Dream and not a chore. For the "newbe" beginner to the intermediate student, this book will do it all.  When I had a question about structuring a photo gallery, I e-mailed a question to Janine and was astonished to receive a reply the following day. She provided a clear solution to my problem and added several additional hints to improve upon my design.    I can definitely recommend this book to all those that want a great introduction to the marvels of Dreamweaver 
 This reference work does neatly complement the other rock dictionaries that are around such as the rolling stone record guide or the allmusic guide. Basically these books do provide information that is necessary to varying degrees. This one is quite heavy on the discography side, which  is not a strength of the others and does fullfill a need in any rock library. It might be on the heavy side actually 
 When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think.  Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for "enjoyment."  That being said, I love this movie, and here's why.    1. It's a true story. 2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the "wrong" country.  How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country?  This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian.  If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays 
 The power of this book is unbelievable!  It is available in Spanish version & I made my own French translation (available upon request).  I have used it extensively to teach ESL, mainly to Hispanic elementary age students, and French as a foreign language at all grade levels.  The grammatical structure combined with the visual impact of the intriguing pictures make it a sure win with kids and adults 
 Before the movie version of the DaVinci Code comes out in May 2006, discerning people will want to read The DaVinci Codebreaker by James L. Garlow.   Dr. James L. Garlow is the Senior Pastor of Skyline Wesleyan Church in La Mesa, California. This book in a compact form becomes a combination dictionary/encyclopedia to help separate the fact from the fiction that most scholars find rampant in Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code.  Garlow stresses that his book is not intended to bash Brown. To the contrary, Garlow feels that Brown has done Orthodox Christianity a service by bringing forth issues that, when examined carefully and thoughtfully, make the Christian faith even more credible.  Garlow refers to Brown's style as "fact-tion" and points out that talk show audiences admitted that they could not tell if and when fiction left off and fact began. This is important because the DaVinci Code claims that Jesus married Mary Magdalene to join two royal bloodlines. It also states that the canon was not formalized until the fourth century when in fact most of the books in today's canon were widely accepted as scripture in the first century. And finally (only for space limitations) that Christianity is really a religion that is an illusion that helps millions of people to cope and be better people.  The DaVinci Codebreaker serves to help the reader understand the real historical facts that are so often misinterpreted or completely changed in Brown's book. This is important because Brown himself states in the opening pages of his book that everything in the book "related to artwork, documents, architecture, and secret rituals are fact."   I found the facts fascinating, the tables (especially on what really constitutes the canon of scripture-- and who says so) extremely clear and useful, and the specific page references to the DaVinci Code useful.  Armchair Interviews says: We think you'll find The DaVinci Codebreaker enthralling.     
 If you enjoy good OL westerns this is one of the most entertaining.  Good story, one of Alan Lad's best westerns 
 I'm a big Ludlum fan and have read several of his works. I have to say, Parsifal Mosaic is definitely one of his best works. The characters are well developed, plot is deep, and descriptions of places and events are vivid and well put together. Ludlum has built the characters very well, and this book is really a thriller from the protagonist's (Michael Havelock) perspective, as opposed to some of this other works where the focus is almost entirely the plot and sequence of events. Even with a plot that gets complex towards the second half of the book, the suspense is very engaging, and it's hard to put the book down. I would highly recommend this book 
 Thank you, Gil Fronsdal.  That much consideration went into every phrase of this elegantly translated version of the Dhammapada is evident.  As a layperson, I cannot vouch for the translation's scholarly merit or technical accuracy.  I can say that it is my favorite translation; the poetic, distilled truth of it resonates with me.  The Dhammapada is part of the Khuddaka Nikaya (or, Collection of Little Texts), the fifth division of the Sutta Pitaka (or, Mountain o' Reading!  Kidding.  Sort of.)  I've known people to recommend that people who are newly serious about Buddhism to begin their studies of the Pali Canon with the Majjhima Nikaya (Middle Length Discourses).  I disagree.  Start here.  Return often.  Be happy 
 Massie is a master historian and storyteller, and this book is nearly impossible to put down. Though reading Massie's prequel, 'Nicholas and Alexandra', is not essential to understandng 'The Romanovs: The Final Chapter', it is highy recommended. Beginning with the murder of the Romanov family, then moving to the discovery and exhumation of their remains, forensic and DNA analysis and the ensuing religious and political debate over their disposition and burial, Massie weaves an accurate historical narrative that reads like the finest detective thriller. Throughout, he carefully explains-in laymen's terminology-basic aspects of genetics, DNA analysis and forensic medicine. The true identity of 'Anastasia' claimant Anna Anderson is finally revealed in this book through a careful analysis of her life and the historical and genetic evidence. A wonderful read, and extremely informative-highly recommended 
 I've been a vegetarian for 12 years.  A vegan for 2.  I recently read this book for the first time.  I wish I had read it a long time ago.  Even though I have read extensively on this subject over the years and most of what Singer says I have read before, he has a way of really driving the issue home.  It's amazing how much of the other literature out their feeds off of this book.  Another thing that makes this book great is that it is backed up solidly.  His references are from trusted sources.  You can be assured that this book isn't just hype or written in an over done matter to just scare you into change.  It is true and unexagerated.  This book is absolutely a must read for anyone interested in the subject and any one who eats meat or dairy.  You should be aware of how dinner gets on your plate.  It's irresponsible not to.  I wish it was required reading in schools.  Too many people live blindly on this subject and need their eyes opened. Since reading this book I have bought more copies of it to give away to friends of mine or anyone who seriously questions my vegan lifestlye. I have one warning for you.  If you are not interested in the philosophy behind animal rights, take Singers own advice and skip the first chapter and go back to it when you have finished the book.  For those who are not familiar with philosophy the first chapter may seem dry or forein.  However it is an important chapter and should be read but again does not have to be read as a first chapter inorder to understand the book.  I keep reading all these reviews from people who are obviously into the philosophy behind it and that is great but they are giving it reviews based solely on the philosophy.  Which I agree, if you were looking forward to a book full of great philisophical debate I think you would be dissappointed. I think it is a mistake to base your review on the philosophy only.  Although Singer could obiously go on and on about the philosophy behind it he chooses not to.  I feel that is admirable.  I believe that Singer realized that those interested in pholosophy are fewer in number than those confused by it.  By limiting the exposure of his philisophical views he made it possible to reach a larger audience.  All in all, an absolutley excellant book for the beginer and weathered alike.  If you have been a vegetarian/ vegan for a long time read this book to revitalize your passions about the subject.  If you are a beginer- get passionate about it!   
 her book teaches how to relax in the bath and it also has some great  recipes 
 My 10-year-old son is definately a math "smarty pants" and when this book arrived I just left it sitting around to see if he would "discover" it and and boy did he!  It's full of fun math games and activities and he dove into it for hours; not bad for a lazy summer day activity.  I highly recommend it for your "smarty pants" or even your not-so-smarty-pants if he or she is willing to play in the realm of numbers 
 In section 3.5, David Pogue writes "In some ways, just buying a Macintosh was a renegade act of self-expression...", I believe it says it all! :) David really knows what he's talking about. I've tried almost every tip/trick/gem he gives in this superb book and it worked. The missing manual is great book for a stunning operating system and a fantastic computer. This book is highly recommended for folkes who are really interested in knowing how to work with Mac OSX. Worth the $.   Cheers 
 I bought my mom & myself a copy of this book and both of us keep it handy for ready reference.  I've bought a lot of health books and this is the best that I've ever read.  I'm very glad to have it, have told many friends about the book and the website, and expect to read and reread both the website and the book many, many times 
    	What is magic to four friends who will soon be split apart? It is a life saver, something to keep them together while on summer vacation. On this particular summer that magic came in the form of pants. As the four girls go to different places over the summer, the pants travel with them. Lena goes to Greece, Carmen goes to see her dad, Bridget goes to soccer camp, and Tibby stays home. Each girl will find something new in not only the world, but also in each other.   This wonderful book grabbed my attention right away. I recommend it to anyone who likes being on the edge of their seat or getting lost in an exiting book. Will the four girls still be friends? Will Carmen forgive her dad? Will Kostas forgive Lena? Will Bridget meet the love of her life? Is Bailey ok? These are questions that come to mind when you are lost in these girls' world.  -Rachel Few  
 I got my copy of The Days of Whine and Noses and gave up precious mommy sleep to finish it all into the wee hours of the morning.  I laughed, snorted out loud in hysteria and nodded in such sympathetic understanding.  Knee deep in my own days of whine and noses,this was a bridge over the Barbie shoes, dirty baby wipes and animal cracker crumbs.  Keep it up, Lisa 
 This is one of the best albums to hit the streets in 2005. One of the few albums you can listen to EVERY song w/o skipping once and it's great to listen to when ridin with ya friends. The best songs are sorry for the stupid things, grown and sexy, the lonliness, tonight it's goin down, and god must love you.  So why do i give this 4 stars and not 5. Well I took a point off due to the fact that this cd is copy protected. I mean it's one thing to keep someone for just making random copies of an album and givin them to all their friends but to install viruses and spyware on their computers no. So really yall i gotta say we really shouldnt be blaming sony, we should be blaming those that make copy after copy and give it to all their friends. (There is a difference between making a back up copy or riping to ones iPod and just illegally making coppies and giving them to everyone) The good unfortunately have to suffer for that bad. Because of all those people they treat us all like criminals. But i do agree that even if you dont illegally share music. Don't you still feel like you should be entitled to your privacy? Do you really need sony keeping track of everything you do with a cd. I put this on my older computer and saw the media max. it was a lousy cd player and it didnt seem to erase anything but still.............................  
 ...if it were for heterosexuals.  Playboy is a multidimensional and lively magazine for men. It addresses all areas of male life including technology, work, hobbies, and sports.  Yes, sex is included, both in word and pictorial, but, clearly, Playboy is not smut.  There's nothing dirty about it. Nude women appear on a small number of its pages contents, and they are far most innocently portrayed than you'll find just about anywhere else on the internet.    Nowadays, the culture bar has been set so low that the idea of nude women, appearing alone in a frame, being regarded as pornography seems rather quaint. Honestly, there is no exploitation to be found in any of their exposes. The girls are an immediate justification of evolutionary psychology as they are mature but at the height of physical fertility. They are hypnotic to view. The articles, which are admittedly the clichd excuse for reading Playboy, are, in fact, extremely underrated. Many of them are focused and educational.    The only reason that I don't give it five stars is due to the fact that I am not a member of the Democratic party, and I feel that Playboy has an ideological agenda that it expresses far too often. This past issue had a slanted interview with a Democratic advisor and an article by Arthur Schlesinger which was highly biased. I really think this is inappropriate because a lifestyle magazine should not shove politics down one's throat.  Furthermore, such an ideological vantage point is absurd given that the editors' real enemies are not "theocrats," but are the male-hating bully boys of political correctness.  None of these shrill social critics can be found are on the right.  They spread misandry from perches in the media and from womyn's studies programs that terrorize our universities.  A publication like this, to have any engagement or importance, must recognize, battle, and ridicule political correctness wherever it is found. 
 I guess this is worth the money,it has some good songs and worth the money i have most of all my ramones on vinyl but this is a nifty ramones anthology 
 Crouched in wait during a game of hide and seek, 12-year-old Veronica Swan witnesses a stranger brutally murder her two younger sisters. The family -- as well as their entire Mormon community -- is never the same, as the memory of the two lives, only four and six years old, so tragically cut short is continuously with them everywhere they go. But eventually, Ronnie's religious parents come to grips with the murder, and even meet with the mentally unstable Scott Early to forgive him for what he's done to them.   The very thought of forgiving Scott -- who was free to resume a regular life after only three years in a mental institution -- sickens Ronnie. She wonders why he should be able to have a baby daughter of his own, when he took away the lives of her family's babies.   The moment she's old enough, Ronnie moves to California, where she knows that Scott and his family are trying to resume entry to regular society. By careful calculation, she's able to become part of their lives, and when they least know it, is faced with the decision of altering their own fate.   As always, Mitchard writes a fantastic novel, full of realistic characters and dialogue. It's too easy to imagine being in the place of the Swan family, at the moment of their greatest pain, and to wonder what the true purpose of life's events is. 
 Set somewhere in heartland (actually, "Midland") America around the turn of the 20th century, "The Magnificent Ambersons" is a sharp and ultimately melancholy look at change.  Founded on old money, the family's generations glide easily along in extravagance, until the cash runs out.  Their unwillingness to adapt to new times and new industry dooms their lives of comfort and inertia, as their mansions decay and their neighborhood becomes one of common housing and polluted air.    The protagonist is George Amberson Minafer, the sole inhabitant of the third generation and an insufferable snob.  He gets his come-uppance in the end, but the Ambersons have fallen so far so quickly that hardly anyone notices or cares anymore.  He's chagrined to find after the fall of  the house of Amberson that his once-prominent family is not even mentioned  in the city history of great family names.  His mother is irrationally, almost beyond belief, defensive and protective of her little scion.  It's no wonder he was the terror of the town for so many years.    Booth Tarkington gradually clues the reader in that something's going wrong with the Amberson empire.  He points out, mostly through Minafer's  agonized thoughts, that nothing is permanent.  The great fortunes and mansions that displace the Ambersons will themselves fade one day, and the customs and people one knows from infancy on will likewise shift.  Midland undergoes a jarring shift from the wealthy and their poorer but settled neighbors to a bustling, dirty city of what Minafer sees as money-grubbing ethnic immigrants and incessant change.  The old rich who didn't adapt  fall victim to what one modern political commentator has called "creative destruction."  As if to underscore the transitory nature of things, Tarkington kills off most of the Amberson family as if it were itself somehow defective and weak.  Minafer redeems himself somewhat at the end but only because of necessity.  The few Ambersons who are left find themselves in a nearly alien culture that took only several decades to establish itself.  Like Ozymandias, the Ambersons thought themselves and their way of life to be endless. Tarkington's rather bleak message seems to be that nothing is forever, no future is guaranteed, and that those who follow have no more claim on permanence than the mighty who have fallen before them.      
 I was truly able to relate to the family situations and common anger responses discussed in this book. I soon came to realize how I have been mishandling my anger for most, if not all, of my adult life. The author discusses our need to discontinue those anger responses that haven't been working for us thus far in particular situations and to step back and assess the true reasons for our anger. She then helps us think through realistic alternative responses. She supports our right to be angry and challenges us to avoid considering our anger as being either wrong or inappropriate. If we're angry, we're angry. We just need to do something productive with it as, properly channeled, the emotional energy we possess when angry could help drive us to make major positive changes in our life. I am going through an ugly divorce and I now recognize that both my and my husband's inability to effectively handle anger was a key contributing factor to our failed marriage. Though it is too late for my own marriage, I'm giving this book to my daughter, who I often see repeating in her own marriage some of the poor anger responses she learned at home. The alternative responses do work, though they aren't easy to remember in heated situations. It will take a concerted effort to "practice" appropriate anger responses until they become second nature. But it's worth the effort as I have already seen positive change occur in several of my relationships. This was a great "AHA" book for me. I understand so much more about my own anger now than I ever have and am prepared to manage it in a way that will most likely blow my family members away 
 A really cute second installment in the Bath and Body mysteries. Persia and her aunt are having financial woes at venus Envy and they find out it is due to another cutthroat beauty maven in town. This lady will stop at nothing to get on top. She poisens the roses, steals formulas and maybe murder? When a pushy saleswoman gets murdered and a friend is being framed, Persia goes undercover to try to find out what is going on and to get her fragrance journal back, but she bites off more than she can chew this time. Old and new friends join in this cute second   installment of the Series. Cute and won't disappoint.   
 This is a great one for your collection. You can relax to this cd and it is great for a good rolling party 
 This is not actually a review and i know this is not the place to be doing this, but i am curious to find out if this card is compatible with the Windows Vitsa OS 
 Sargent gives a broadly-painted view of nanotech, directed to a lay audience. He surveys the manifold promises for the coming decades. In medical diagnosis, healing, solar cells, computing etc. Glittering vistas indeed. Nanotech is presented as a panacea to many problems. With only glancing mention of possible complications. But then again, this is a high level book. And if the promises seem hypothetical, even more so are the conjectured complications.  The narrative is thankfully free of much jargon. Though a necessary modicum is presented, so that you get some understanding of what's being said in this field.  The book also has a good references section, where interested readers can get at more detailed articles. 
 Anne Vipond continues her series of excellent books with this guide to cruising the Panama Canal.  Really, anyone visiting Panama would find this book useful, but people on cruise ships will find it invaluable.  Anne does an excellent job of relating the history and geography of the Panama Canal.  She also delves into the details of the actual ports, including the new cruise port in Colon.  This is the best guide to the shore excursions from Colon and on Gatun Lake.  If you're traveling the Panama Canal, this book will bring you much better understanding of this unique destination.  Anyone who will be debarking for the day in Panama will find that the book will save them much time and money.  Highly Recommended!! 
 A great movie. I liked this movie because I like the way Sinatra talks and sings. He is a natural actor always ready with a 'tough-guy' quip delivered with perfect pace and vocal variety. Kim Novak for me is a fabulous actress. Not only is she beautiful but she plays the part of a shy and hesitant starlet perfectly. The songs and the story are great both of which I have transfered to my i-pod to listen to over and over again. 
 this is a great wagon I bought one 2 years ago to take the grandchildren out they love it you can take off the sides when they get older for easy acsess in and out. It has a good size storage underneath which we use as a cooler to keep bevarages in.My daughter liked it so much we just purchased another one for her for the kids. 
 I have been reading this book over the last several nights and have really enjoyed it.  Not a scholar or an historian, I am simply a person who has an unquenchable thirst for stories about this time period.  I liked the  chronological format of the book, and I was particularly interested in the  growing nature of legality over issues like land transfers, inheritance and  marriage.  If I could meet the authors I would like to ask them about the  process they used to research this book, and if they were able to actually  look at some of the original documents they report from.  The notes and  bibliography are fascinating, and when I next have a chance to visit the U  of M's library, I will look up some of the titles.  I would like to thank  the authors for this wonderful book 
 This book covers in depth the LBO of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era 
 When I learned that L. Ron Hubbard had officially "erased" his 2nd wife, Sara, and began describing her as the Russian communist spy Sara Komkosadamanov, and then I saw the huge stack of abandoned dianetics books at a used book store, I knew something was seriously wrong. Since then I've been reading and reading. Now I've just finished a really nice and concise over-view of whole messy subject: 'Combatting Cult Mind Control' by Steven Hassan. If you're tempted to wander into the world of cults, read this book first.       
 I read many years ago that this was the first ever stereo cast album from Columbia. The timing (late 1956) would be about right. Maybe someone who's savvy on recording history can confirm or deny this. If you want to see the film verson (also starring Judy Holiday) it's aired on TCM once in a while. It was the last musical produced by the legendary Arthur Freed 
 Anyone who tried to find the historical Jesus is bound to run into sharp criticism.  For true believers the attempt itself is close to blasphemy and for the non-believer perhaps a waste of time.  However most of us who are in between find the question quite fascinating.  Now A. N. Wilson has written a book about what we can know about the historical Jesus and indeed the book is both well written and fascinating.  Evidence for the historical Jesus is quite thin and he is almost not mentioned at all except in the gospels and later writings of Paul and a few others.  However it is reasonably certain that a preacher/rabbi named Joshua or some such version of Jesus actually lived. Wilson has, however, had to speculate a lot to uncover any plausible description of Jesus the man.  Fortunately he generally labels speculation as speculation, as an honest scholar must and he does present a believable portrait of what Jesus may well have been like. In the process he pretty well destroys the gospels as historical documents.  Indeed, the Bible should never be read as exact history, but a collections of moral tales, poetry, metaphors and spiritual guidance.  Those who would have it otherwise in reality degrade the book into some sort of absolute text, almost a cook book,  rather than the spiritual guide it was apparently meant to be.  It is my opinion that this absolutist fallacy has been the cause of much of the violence between faiths and has certainly not helped produce the kind of spiritual and philosophical basis that Jesus may well have intended, based on many of the sayings he apparently left behind.  This is an excellent book for readers who has not made up their minds on the subject and I recommend it highly.   
 I have recently been on something of a Bill Bryson binge.  After having read The Mother Tongue and Short History of Nearly Everything, which are two of his more scholarly-oriented books, I decided to try this book (perhaps it should be noted that I have yet to read A Walk in the Woods; this title just appealed to me more).  The stories are often clever, and despite his complaining Bryson rarely, if ever, leaves the threshold of good intentions.  You have to realize that he is a reasonable man, and some of these irrational rants are merely for entertainment's sake and should not be analyzed too closely. That said, I agree with the editorial review in that sometimes he enters Dave Barry-like hyperbole, something that I personally find cheap and overdone, although Dave Barry sells lots of books, so many people must think that style is funny.  Personally, the more subtle humor, such as the little pet names for his wife he inserts in what are supposedly transcripts of actual conversations with her, that amuses me, as well as his joyful musings on American life.  Sure, this isn't too profound, but it manages to be intelligent and critical, while maintaining a whimsical air.  I can just picture ol' Bill with a content smirk on his face while writing these articles in his house in Hanover.  To sum it all up, Bill Bryson seems like the kind of guy I would love to have over for dinner, assuming he is as entertaining in person as he is in this book 
 Enjoyable journey back to the Roman Empire under Vespasian.  Of course, like all empires, Rome needed a police service or, in this case, a Private Eye.  Marcus Didius Falco makes a good detective, private or otherwise.  And the history sounds pretty plausible as well 
 If I could rate this with 6 stars I would. Simply the best CD I've bought in at least a decade the songs are so good. From catchy hard rock (When Did You Get So Safe) to country blues (Mud on My Shoes) Alanis style techno (Down to Nowhere), heady solo acoustic (Water to Sky), to otherworldly dreamscapes (And Well Dance). This would easily be a greatest hits album for most artists.  And this is before you get to the bonus CD. Almost too good to be true. The first track ("Hydrogen") is probably the best flat out rock song I've heard in about a year, and the chord change in the acoustic "Lavender Cowgirl" is of the most unexpectedly clever ones I've ever heard. Most of the bonus CD is acoustic. The song "December in New York" is brilliant with its acoustic guitar and piano--it sounds like something straight off Joni Mitchell's Blue album. There's even a spoken word song "Don't set foot over the railway track".  Thea's voice on these discs echoes those of a number of other female artists (Natalie Merchant, Alanis Morrisette, Joni Mitchell, Chrissy Hynde, and even Margo Timmins from the Cowboy Junkies). To me, these songs sound like they're sung by several different women rather than one artist.  After just one play I was a fan. Simply a must have. 
 When I need to search within myself and better understand my relationship with God, I venture to the part of my bookshelf that holds Rabbi Harold Kushner's books.   We all want to live a life that matters. This is a guide book of suggestions that are helpful in finding purpose in our "every day lives".  Thank You, Rabbi.   
 This calendar was everything I expected it to be...Pure MADONNA!!!! It is really amazing. These photos are completely flawless. It is a must have for true Madonna-maniacs!!! 
 Some of the graphics in the book are a little much but the author's don't call any punches and don't want to sugar coat anything.  The story moves fast and holds your attention along with being well written. I enjoyed it 
 Satirical.  Sarcastic.  Ironic.  Humorous.  Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life.  This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life.  The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield.  He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home.  In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life.  One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps.  As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him.  Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness.  But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad.  Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends.  When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything.  Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all.  As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets 
 The great thing about buying a recording of a Handel opera is that you know you won't be disappointed in the material. Every aria is like a delicious sweet, and you can't stop eating them. Nicholas McGegan leads this production with his usual expertise and musicianship -- and everyone follows suit. Each of the singers performs with character and conviction. The most astonishing is perhaps Brian Asawa, who has never sounded fresher -- Cecilia, Sumi, Montserrat, step aside! Judith Malafronte sounds just a little raw, but on the first disc only. The second and third discs show this well under control. The Hanover Band plays with their usual warmth and precision. All in all, probably the best recording of this work I have yet heard 
 It is a fine book -- the content is intriguing and historical. Seems like a good translation,not choppy, easy to read.  The binding is holding up fine 
 The Master Criminal, one of the best characters in the Amelia Peabody series, returns in The Ape Who Guards the Balance. I also enjoyed hearing parts of the story from different points of view (in addition to Amelia's) 
 Not even the absence of Christine McVie could get me to lower my score to 4 stars.  Lindsey Buckingham makes up for any flaws in this concert.  His chops on I'm So Afraid alone would be worth the cost of the DVD.  Mick Fleetwood has calmed down a bit, but he still does a great job and Stevie is still Stevie.  
 I thought this was put together so well.  It was fascinating to see the history of Broadway from virtually the beginning of 1900.  Fabulous to see old footage of New York and Time Square.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Theatre.  It is fabulous 
 This was required text for a college class on the Acts of the Apostles. Technically, this book is superior, and yet on a level where most undergraduates should not have any trouble. Personally, I prefer a commentary that not only addresses the technical but also leads me in the direction of application. On the latter, I felt that brother Witherington was a bit weak. Still, he does an exhaustive job 
 Next to Toby Tyler, this is Disney's most beloved circus movie. And why shouldn't it be? It's also one his most tearful animated tearjerkers. "Baby Mine" is without a doubt a nerve strainer. It sounds like a lullabye, while giving joy to the small loved one in your grasp. That particular song sets the mood for the rest of the movie, and who Dumbo, the elephant . . . is. A somewhat orphan who lost his mother to not death, but punishment, banishment, and also captivity. This is Dumbo's time to shine, and find the talents he knows not that he has. With the help of his little mouse friend who becomes his circus coach and manager, they pull Dumbo out of obscurity and into the big top limelight. Dumbo finds the wonderous elephant he can be, and always was. Thereby, giving his family profile a much better name 
 I use to think Andrew Jackson was such a Great Man and leader of the American People and that the United States Government was the wisest and most powerful government in the world.  That is until I read this book back in the early 1970's.  The way I looked at this country and it's leaders was turned around from then on in my life.  I had already gone through the period where John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King were assassinated right on TV for the whole world to see, in broad daylight.  And then the cover ups!  And the American people bought into the lies, the deceit, that was told to us, hook, line, and sinker.  I had already done research on the Kennedy assassination and knew that it was a cover up. Lone assassin my butt!  So, when I read this book by Dee Brown the flood lights came on.  Watching TV as a little boy the "Red Savages" were always the bad guys and those programs were made to brainwash the American people into believing that lie as well.  And we did.  Until Dee Brown released this book.  The murderous atrocities, stealing their land for gold, rapes of young boys, women and men by United States Soldiers, were all allowed and committed by this white washed United States Government then and now, YES NOW, towards Native Americans should be put on trial and a shakedown of this so called Government "for the people" should be the least we as Americans should do.  But most Americans watch the six o' clock evening news and that is the only gospel they will ever know or believe.  Of course white America made excuses and perpetuated lies to try and discredit Dee Brown and the truth that was told in the pages of this explosive book, over 30 years ago now.  But, after selling 5 million copies and still climbing, it has stood the test of time and it's opposers.  If you never read another book besides this one, as long as you live, this should be the book.  You say, quit complaining and what can be done about it?  I just did, I wrote it down and you just read it and you now know how to find out more by buying this book.   
 This book is great for young children and also has a meaning for adults and teens too.I was filled with laughs and smiles when I read this book.I am quite honest when I say Babar is my Hero of the day 
 This book exposes the truth about the injustices occuring in India without being clouded by passion. As always Ms. Roy gives the reader an honest account of what is actually transpiring. She gives the reader a portrait of the various people who are affected by these "social" projects without coming across as the evening news. This is definately a must read for anyone who believes in justice for everyone, not just the wealthy 
 I haven't read the bible in a long time but this bible is really interesting. Passages are written in sentences, like in a regualy book and they read like stories. This makes the chapters easier to read and understand. I do have a bit of trouble with the Hebrew names but I have made of list, in the back of the bible, of the ones used most often so I just refer to that if I get stuck.   I would highly recommend this bible. 
 As a certified DUI counselor, I found this book to be an excellent safety manual that all driver's should read (especially beginning ones!). There should be a link to this book in all state DMV Driver Handbook's!). I wish it had included however, a discussion of the ENABLING that state's do with regards to continuing to allow drunk drivers to drive! While its great this book teaches drivers how to spot, and avoid drunk driver's, a better idea is to how to keep them from having initial and continued access to motor vehicles, and thus the road, to begin with! 
 This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and a keeper.  Michael Keaton's "Billy Blaze", a ne'er-do-well entrepreneur, is hilarious and his antics are fast-paced and manic ("Note to self: CALL STARKIST").  Henry Winkler's metamorphosis from Superwimp into Superman is a relief ("YOU'RE GONNA PLAY TENNIS WITH GOD!") Shelley Long's portrayal of a hooker is great.  Cameo includes Clint Howard (Ron Howard's brother) as a dorky high-school kid looking for a prom-night ride for him and his girl in a limo, ANY limo, even the City Morgue's hearse!  See it with someone you can laugh with until your sides hurt 
 This is overall a good compilation of patterns.  However, all the patterns are for back and forth knitting.  It would be nice if in the round instructions were also included.  Also, some patterns start with Row 1 on the right side, and some with Row 1 on the wrong side, which makes it hard to try to put them together.  Sometimes it is easy to figure out how to change these patterns to make them work as in the cases above, but not on the more complicated ones.  
 Short Bus was nothing short of amazing.  I can't even imagine how to describe it.  I'll just say it must be seen to be believed 
 Usually remembered as the first album of a career that has produced over 25 of them, people forget just how listenable For You. Prince writes and plays every instrument on every track that ranges from the fun disco of "Just As Long As We're Together" to the throwback Marvin Gaye-esqe "Baby", which is a side that Prince has rarely shown since. While in "Soft and Wet" he had his first dive into how to produce a sleazy pop hit that would lay the groundwork for his Dirty Mind and Controversy albums. All epic journeys begin with one small step.  Essential Tracks: Soft and Wet / Bab 
 Any guitar player must have this, period. This is one of the first electric guitarist, and yet, this is as good as the electric guitar can get. Charlie Christian is a titan, not only for the guitar but for jazz in general. Be-bop? Just listen to this guy and you'll understand the connection bewteen the old swing jazz and the new thing that was coming. Charlie knew it all along. The alterante takes are also essential, like Bird alternate takes, each one has a different solo and must be heard and compared and studied to get an idea of the genious of this man. The packaging, while beautiful is stupid, you need to take your CDs into jewel cases to prevent damage. But all is forgiven for the amazing sound quality, breathtaking. All stars, five star release! 
 This book has become my number 1 Bible resource.  The fact the I can pick a topic by chapter, turn to the end of that chapter and just pop names into the blanks in the verses makes it so easy to pray God's word for my children.  I use it for others, too.   When I started my moms group at church it was the first book on our list to read.  I have heard nothing but rave reviews.  It is a truly incredible book 
 This book is an excellent resource for teachers in the elementary grades. It gives a listing of many different spelling rules, generalizations, exceptions and more.  I used it this year with my students...I introduced a  different rule each week with words appropriate for their grade level. Take  a look at this book. It's wonderful 
 I wanted to know more about this book and seem to have encountered reviewers who have treated this as a homework assignment.  One assumes you have read the book, it is not necessary to go into extreme detail and it is really in poor taste to GIVE AWAY THE PLOT in your review as was the case with one reviewer's comments.  Most unfortunate. 
 Practical advice and deep insights for anyone who is thinking about making  a major lifestyle change.  CHANGING COURSE focuses particularly on women  deciding to join their husbands on long sailing trips, but I too find the  advice and insights useful even though I am a man with no interest in  sailing!  The author writes so well that this book is entertaining and  useful for anyone who is fascinated by the phenomenon of personal change 
 This story goes to the heart of how much a parent loves her child.  Reading it to your own children helps them understand that they are loved all the time, not just when they are being good. A rather realistic verbal  interaction between the storybook parent and child also helps 
 This book ought to be in bookstores.  A study such as this one, focused as it on the specific issue of women's education during a specific historical era, provides an excellent insight into what it must have been like to be living in American society at that time.  The book goes into fascinating detail regarding who's who and how certain powerful and not-so-powerful women influenced women's education and thus American attitudes in the post-Civil War, industrial-growth era.  For me as a non-educator (I run a small business), the notes don't get in the way at all, and in fact I found myself interested enough to look up many of the additional comments in the notes.  Nicely done.  Highly recommended 
 This set is wonderful in that it includes everything you really need in a cutlery set. Most of the commercial stamped sets include upwards of twenty knives, but you'll end up using five or six on a regular basis. The quality of these forged blades is stunning and the edges are razor sharp. With proper honing, using the steel included in the set, these blades will keep their edge for over a year of daily use. I would recommend finding a local bladesmith and having the edge sharpened professionally. It isn't expensive and will maximize performance.  The handle itself is comfortable and the balance feels natural. Although the manufacturer says that these are dishwasher safe, I would suggest immediate hand washing after use and complete drying before returning it to the block. 
 America owes its liberty to the honeybee.  That was the opinion of no other than George Washington.  The story, recounted in _Bees in America: How the Honey Bee Shaped a Nation_ (University Press of Kentucky) by Tammy Horn, is only one aspect of bee folklore, science, and history recounted in a delightful book full of anecdotes and facts which will spark admiration for this sometimes overlooked part of our nation's agriculture.  The way the bees won the American Revolution is that a Quaker girl was given a message to deliver to Washington concerning an imminent attack by Cornwallis.  The resourceful messenger realized she was being pursued by Redcoats, but as she galloped, she was able to overturn beehives in her path.  The bees went after the Redcoats, Washington got his intelligence, and, well, the rest is history.  Americans have always loved the honey bee not only for its delicious product (and the wax), but also because the hive is a symbol for a perfectly run society.  Paradoxically, it is not a good symbol for our society.  We are loosely organized, everyone joins in the pursuit of happiness in an idiosyncratic way, and we have no official religion, political party, or even family structure.  Bees are little robots, and their regimented roles are fine for them, but not an example for our human ways.  Their industry, however, we like; it is an admirable trait to be "as busy as a bee."  We like that the bees make a home for themselves, and that they work hard to ensure that the home will be able to last the winter; they are thrifty, efficient animals.  Americans are quite likely to think that if someone is poor, he ought to take a lesson from the bee.  Bees were transported, with great difficulty and much bee mortality, to the earliest of American colonies.  They took to the new land as readily as the human immigrants, going wild and providing sustenance and employment for bee hunters (as opposed to beekeepers).  Many Indians learned to value bees and their products, but one settler wrote that the Osage Indians in 1836 had held a day of mourning because they had found a swarm of bees; it was a sign that the Osage ways were doomed.  Railroad men were horrified at the initial idea of hauling bees, and the man who convinced them to do so in 1907 had to ride along with his hives.  _The American Bee Journal_ editorialized in 1903 that automobiles had a distinct advantage compared to horse-drawn wagons for carrying bees, because autos "...will never get frightened, run away and break things by being attacked by cross bees."  The benefits to agriculture from bee pollination are so great that in California, especially with its almond orchards, beekeepers make more money by renting out bees for pollination than they do selling honey or wax.  Horn examines such topics as the rehabilitation of returning shell-shocked veterans by beekeeping, the tall tales that surround bees and bee hunters, the use of the bee example by sex educators (who used birds as well), the military use of bees to detect chemicals and explosives, bees in American literature and (disastrously) in movies like _The Swarm_, and the use of electronic tags on hives to deter bee rustlers.  In an up-to-date discussion of current bee problems, ranging from bacteria to mites, beetles, El Ninõ, and cheap imported honey, Horn (a beekeeper herself) reflects that the American beekeeping community is decreasing and bees are dying in record numbers.  There are scientists working on solutions, like breeding hives of bees that will take punctilious and timely care to keep infections low before they can spread; there may also be genetic studies that will lead to more resistant bees.  Horn winds up with the classic reflection that by trying to control bees all these centuries, we have learned many valuable lessons, but none so important as that bees (and nature in general) will never be completely controlled.  
 I've read many books by the great psychological theorists like Jung, Adler, Horney etc., but none of them cut to the heart of becoming like Fritz does. Even the other third wave analysts like Rogers and Maslow still  take a more abstract approach: they suggest ideas on how to function  optimally in interpesonal relationships, but don't dig very deep into the  application, or the how. This book uses practices that have parallels in  Zen buddhism and other sorts of experience-oriented disciplines, but  doesn't praise any particular system or thinker. The presentation of the  material is very simple and informal--taken from live lectures. Thus,  nothing is academically obscure. Rather, its as though one is listening to  a very integrated human being who is beyond the need to aggrandize himself  through helping others. This is a very good book for people that wish to  open themselves up to the full experience of living 
 I really enjoyed this book. I have been saying forever that sugar and formula is what's wrong with health and kids now a days. I think everyone needs to read this book, and really rethink what you are feeding your kid. I wonder if the food company is in cahoots with the entertainment business, working together to the dumbing down of America? 
 I never thought I was guilty of this, but today I realized it.  I couldn't listen Drag It Up without immediately comparing to classics like Too Far to Care and Satellite Rides or even the pop gems Fight Songs and Rhett's solo The Instigator.  But, alas I did.   Drag It Up is a much more somber affair than any of the Old 97's previous albums and reverts back to the country stylizings of their older records rather push further into the pop arena.    However, they still manage ro produce a fairly solidly sounding album (I think the non-Rhett songs don't hold up quite as well).  It might be better to listen to after midnight.  If you want a powerful energy boost, listen to the raving rock of Too Far to Care, but if your in the mood for well put together melancholy alt. country this is your ticket. If you can you should really catch these guys live, the versions of these songs live are awesome particularly "Won't Be Home" 
 The book was a good as advertised and my wife loved it.  The only problem is that the book is very fragile.  It arrived with one string broken and a twirler that did not twirl.  Amazon.com replaced it but the replacement also had a broken string.  I was able to fix it, but it was annoying nonetheless 
 This was another great novel by Michael Crichton. This book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members, then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language. The gorilla will help them out in the end... They will find some other stuff that they didn't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members.  Once the story gets going though, you can't stop reading it, you'll never want to put it down. There is a lots of twist and turns that will suprise you. If you enjoy a good science fiction then you will enjoy both the technology and the story. If you don't enjoy science fiction, if you can see past the hubble in the beginning with the systems, you will still enjoy this story. It's a good book for everyone 
 I have all three volumes of this book - the best review of cooking and life in general I have ever read.  My volume 1 is so tattered and torn I am trying to get another one.  From what I remember the author was the brother of Christian Herter, a member of Eisenhower's cabinet.  I am buying copies for both of my sons as their cooking (and living) bible 
 Rudyard Kipling's classic boy's tale of the sea is inhabited by Freddy Bartholomew as spoiled rich boy Harvey, Spencer Tracy as compassionate fisherman Manuel, Lionel Barrymore as good-natured Captain Disko, and Melvyn Douglas as Harvey's negligent father. Freddy Bartholomew, who received top billing in this film, is perhaps the best child actor who has ever lived, simply because he really seems to be acting rather than just looking cute. Spencer Tracy, who won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role, is one of the best adult actors of all time. As if that weren't enough, Lionel Barrymore (It's a Wonderful Life) and Melvyn Douglas (Ninotchka, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House) are two of the top character actors. And, to top it off, you've got John Carradine and Mickey Rooney in supporting roles. You can't beat the story or the cast.  Victor Flemming (Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind, The Good Earth) did a superb job directing his talented cast and crew through the John Lee Mahin/Marc Connelly/Dale Van Every screenplay, which tells the story of how a spoiled rich boy, out of sorts with himself and the world, falls off a cruise ship into the sea, and is fished out by a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Once on board Manuel's fishing schooner, Harvey learns he won't be able to return to shore for three months, until the fishermen have finished their season of fishing. At first he fights his plight; but through the love and patience of Manuel, Harvey soon learns to fit in and become a contributing member of the crew. He makes mistakes; but Manuel helps him learn and eventually grow into a boy of character.   This is a great father-son film. It's also a wonderful film about the sea and sailing. There are some breathtaking shots of ships, especially during a race between two schooners. There are some wonderful relationships. It's interesting to see how each adult deals with Harvey, and how each changes in that relationship as Harvey changes. One of the best scenes of the film, and the one that got to me the most, is at the very end, when Harvey is going home with his dad. First we see the dinghy in which Harvey and Manuel fished being pulled behind his dad's car. Harvey couldn't bear to part with it, so his dad brought it with them. Then the camera pans to the back of the car, where we see Harvey and his dad in the back seat through the window. Harvey is animated with enthusiasm as he is obviously telling his dad about all his adventures - even to the point of exaggerating the size of the first fish he caught. It's a great final statement about the difference an experience like that and a friend like Manuel can make in a boy's life.   Waitsel Smit 
 I am very surprised to see all to see these bad reviews.  THIS CD IS  AWESOME.  Punky and country Punky.... This CD rocks  I wonder if people  like the heavier side of SOUL ASYLUM 
 This is a wonderful book. Donna Bryant Goertz makes a strong case that 'problem' children should not be tutored, medicated, put in remedial or disciplinary classes or otherwise excluded, but allowed to develop emotionally and intellectually at their own pace in a respectful, loving, supportive, and highly structured environment. Arranged as a series of case studies, the stories of these young students dramatically support Bryant Goertz's thesis, and the personalities and voices of the children shine through. In addition, parents (or others who work with children) can learn much from the discussions of how to approach behaviors that are disruptive to a Montessori community (or household, or playgroup). 
 I had initially avoided reading Heidegger because I had been told that his work was unreadable. I believe this is both true and untrue. It is certainly a difficult book. You will have to make a serious commitment if you are going to get through it. However, Heidegger does an incredible job of leading you through the argument. He is constantly summarizing the argument and pulling the pieces together into a coherent whole. This is something that many fail to do.  If you are interested in hermeneutic philosophy, I would highly reccommend that you read Being and Time. You will be glad you invested the time and energy.  An amazing piece of work 
 This was the most uncomfortable book I've ever read, but I loved it.  I didn't want to continue, but at the same time I couldn't put it down.  I'm in the education field and I think this should be required reading.  I've recommended it to four very different people and they all feel the same way 
 Thomas Wolfe is undoubtedly one of the, if not THE, greatest writers of the Twentieth Century. He is so underappreciated.  O Lost is the correct title (finally) to his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was always intended to bear this title, and rightfully so, for if you read it you will understand how lost he was as a child, an adolescent, and a man. His story of the Gants is incredibly gripping and touching...hang in there the speed picks up once you get  into it. It will give you so much insight on the South and the trials of a young man torn between his city, his family, and his ambitions. Thank God for Thomas Wolfe 
 If you loved their music, you'll surely love this CD 
  i own about 600 movies and at least 70 % are horror drama, this movie was put together very well (and gents) did i mention 3 HOT babes,guessed some of the plot and people invloved in the beginning ,but really enjoyed the ending ,i have spent 3 yrs.in korea and 2 in japan,Must say Korea is coming on strong with the horror genre ,nuff said ,BuY iT. THEN WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES AND CHECK OUT THE YOUNG LADY IN THe RED DRESS ;WHOA ,later..  
 I first read this book when I took an undergraduate philosophy course from Karl Popper himself way back in 1969 at the University of Minnesota.    My opinion of it has never changed, and I am pleased to see that an Indian press has resurrected this seminal work:  it remains, for me, the best serious evaluation of the conceptual foundations of Indian philosophy.  It is a serious work by a serious philosopher, so those in search of shortcuts to nirvana should continue their search elsewhere.   I lost my old copy of this book years ago, and am thrilled to have found it once again.  Thanks, Amazon.com 
 December 1986 my family presented me with this book. I enjoy readings of William Barclay, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Carlo Carretto, Richard Foster, Carl Jung, C. S. Lewis, Henri J. Nouwen, Mother  Teresa, Elton Trueblood, John Wesley, to name a few. But to have writings  by these great authors compiled in one book is unimaginable. On top of that  there are the lyrics of some of the most well known and loved hymns  included in this book. There are monthly retreat models that can be done  individually or with a group. The story "A Doll of Salt" by  Anthony Bloom is a wonderful simile of our developing relationship with  God. I have highlighted, written in the margins, and dogeared so many pages  that I had to get a second copy because the first one is falling apart (and  it was the leather bound copy). The readings are so inspiring and uplifting  as well as thought provoking for the layperson as well as the ordained  minister. If you are going to get this book I encourage you to get the  leather bound for you will discover you will use it on a daily basis along  with your Bible 
 I thought this book would give me specific instructions for what to do in each room to get it together, and I'd follow them and my house would be a nicer place to live. Ha! She talks about how each room in your house reflects a part of you...when I got to the end of the book and realized that each and every room in my house needed serious attention, I finally woke up and got myself the serious attention I'd been needing for a long time. At the time that I read this book, about 2 years ago, I kinda didn't like it because my house didn't get any cleaner. But now that I look back at how many changes I've made in myself, and how I can keep track of my emotional and even physical trouble spots by how  I'm maintaining my house, I realize that reading this book was immeasurably beneficial. And what's funny is that I really hadn't put it together till I started typing this review 
 I am using this book now with Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level Two (audio course). I have already finished the first level of LSLC. This book is a great complement to both levels of LSLC. The best way to use this book with Learning Spanish Like Crazy is to learn how to conjugate the verbs with that audio course and then find different uses for the verbs that you learn in that course by referring to the "Words and Expressions Related to the Verb" section is book.   In this book you will find different ways  to use the same verbs in expressions, sayings and other ways the verbs can be used in Spanish. Spanish has a funny way of taking almost any noun and making a verb out of it or vice versa.  I will give you an example of what I mean. The noun "regalo" means gift in Spanish. But there is also a verb in Spanish that is called "regalar" or "to give as a gift." But Latinos use the verb "regalar" to simply mean "to give" as in "me reglas una ojita?" (would you give me a sheet of paper?).   So I am learning how to conjugate the verbs with Learning Spanish Like Crazy and then using 501 Spanish Verbs not only to reinforce what I am learning about conjugating verbs with LSLC but I am also finding other uses for the verbs, either as nouns, sayings, or just common ways that Latinos use verbs in regular conversation.   I actually have one complaint about this book that is stopping me from giving it five stars.  In the examples that this book gives for Words and Expressions Related to the Verb they fail to use "diminutives." For "small gift" this book has "un regalejo," but I always here Latinos say "regalito."  It would have been nice if this book used more diminutives in the section for Words and Expressions Related to the Verb.  But this is a minor flaw. Get this book and combine it with Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level One and Two and you will be conjugating Spanish verbs in no time.  
 Amazing story, beautifully written.  It has all the elements of an exciting novel, and it is true, which makes it even more awesome 
 Easy recipes. I have lost 10 lbs. without excercising just by using mostly low glycemic recipes 
  In many american universities there is a sharp division between the classic art historians and the linguistics-inclined post modernists. Bryson's range encompasses both.         
 This author's writing style is creative, articulate, and excitingly different from other travel writers.  I feel like I'm in the passenger's seat with him, enjoying the scenery and sharing a few laughs together.  Having taken several of the trips described, I've discovered parts of Washington that were completely new to me.  This book has given me a unique appreciation for the various faces of Washington State 
 I have to disagree with the previous reviewer.  I did not find this book at all boring.  The story was good.  I especially liked the multi-generational family and their relationships to each other.  Mike's and Deborah's relationship was sweet and the relationship between Evan, Molly, and Johnny was touching.  One the negative side, the villain was campy and that part of the story was just unbelievable.  It's hard to believe he would survive in the cold for days with no water or food and being injured over and over.  Also, I had a hard time picturing an 85 year old man driving a snowmobile up a snowy, icy mountain.  I would agree this was not Sala's/McCall's best work, but I give her credit and have to wonder at the courage it must have taken to write a romance while grieving for her fiance 
 This book has a decent amount of information and is very useful for anyone who has trouble delving into heavy scholarly books on the subject of runes.  There is a great deal of speculation, personal feelings being presented, and a little too many "I did this" stories.  I understand she has led a troubled life, but she should not bring too much of that into a non-fiction work(except for the introduction, I'll allow that).  I would recommend this to people who would like to add onto a runic library they have already started.  It's very helpful if cross-referenced with a more scholarly work.  It's also useful if you're trying to introduce somebody to runic study 
 No Matter How Loud I Shout reads like a novel. It is an incredibly well written and compassionate view of the life of some of the country's forgotten "children".  I really enjoyed it as well as "Baby ER" also by Mr. Humes 
 i bought this cookbook due to the introductory price I received and have loved every recipe I have tried.  Many of the recipies are heart healthy and I have found those to be tasty and easy to prepare.  Good luck and good cooking 
 this is without a doubt one of the most valued books I have in my "racing library".   I race and breed quarter horses, but because of the lack of  material on that specific subject I am often drawn to books  on TBs.  The most amazing aspect of this book is that if you changed the  names and dates, Mr Tesio's ideas and predictions are extremely accurate in  todays world.  The openess in which he shares his ideas and the details of  his breeding program are  great .  Very concise and to the point 
 As a teacher, tutor and writer I started with 2nd edition American Heritage Dictionary and have gladly update my source library with each updated edition!  The American Heritage Dictionary, Fourth Edition, is the most current and best reference to have on desk or in backpack.  This larger paperback version is printed with just slightly larger type, thus visually easier to use for all.  The more expensive, larger, and heavier hardcover version {with loadable CD for your desktop and/or laptop} may be something you want in the future, making this edition your best reference for excellent reading comprehension and impressive writing skills! 
 Origionally I had checked this book out from the library, but it was so good I bought a copy for myself. The character development is very good, and the story (though it has a few ho-hum spots) is interesting and flows really nicely. However, this is not a scary book at all but really a rainy afternoon read 
 i don't actually own this album but i have heard every song on it and can tell you that it is well worth your money. some of morcheeba's absolute best songs ever are on this cd, and you get two new songs. there are little comments from DJ paul godfrey for each song along with a "history" of the band. if you don't own all four morcheeba items you should buy this sampler to get a taste of how their sound has evolved. it will probably inspire you to go out and buy all four disks, which are an investment any music lover will profit from 
 This book has changed my life.  I have read it 3 times and made my own cliff notes for quick reference.  Frankly, I wish there was a longer, more detail group study guide to accompany the book.  If you are serious about having peaceful relationships with "everyone" around you, the best way to start is changing yourself.  This has been the quickest route I have found and the most profound.  The author changed my heart and gave me a positive approach to reducing (soon to stop...yeah!...I feel it coming!) my angry reactions and participation in the angry outbursts of others.  I especially wanted to raise my children to the highest standards of life I could find and not "pass on" my dysfunctional upbringing.  What can I say, but thank you to this man who has helped me rise up to a new level of understanding.  God Bless you 
 I first heard Joe Carson back in the early -70's while going through some of my folks' 78's.  At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days);  then I distinctly heard Hank;  on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days).  All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams.  But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride.  If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.  As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet.  Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off.  While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts:  "I Gotta Get Drunk", "The Last Song I'll Ever Sing", and "Shoot The Buffalo" all showcase his voice.  And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding "Fraulein" and "Who'll buy the Wine".  This is one of those albums you have to own;  and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A+++ 
 Heather Nova emanated a sexy, dark vibe in her first albums, "Oyster" and "Siren," with angry-sexy lyrics and sensuous guitar-driven pop music. It was unique, driven and strong musically.  After that, surprisingly, her music seemed to lose some of its edge -- it was still good, just not as intense. Now, in her first album after her daughter's birth, Nova returns some of that intensity to her music, albeit in a slightly more mellow, meditative manner.  Things open on a strong note with the driving guitar of "Welcome," which blossoms into a swirling rock song full of sensuous riffs and Nova's strong voice. "And there's so much I can do for you/Given time I know that I can prove/Now my world is offered up to you/Come inside..." she calls out, sounding more powerful than ever.  That sound doesn't continue, though. The next song, a tribute to Amelia Earhart, is an enchantingly soft ballad that is complete lament, one of the loveliest songs that Nova has ever done. "Motherland" seems to be a song to her child, both marveling at her and promising to protect her.  Then a bit of Nova's earlier sound returns, with slow-burning sultriness. She sings of redbirds, oceans, veiled erotic allusions about tasting pomegranates, a lover who makes her cry with his beautiful face, and a darkly beautiful cover of Chris Isaac's "Wicked."  She finishes up the album with a pair of more uplifting songs -- one which yearns for love, and refers to her body as "sacred ground/Waiting here to be found." The outro is a sweet ballad that assures "darling" of love, comfort, and that "Remember/The sun will always rise/And bring the light..." It sounds corny, but it is rather uplifting.  In a word, "Redbird" straddles the line between the the more sensuous tunes of her early career, and the more mellow, relaxed sound in recent years. It's not surprising -- Nova has grown and matured, and reflects in one love song that "This body has traveled onThis body is fine and strong/This body has given life...."  If Nova seems to be balanced out between sensuality and maturity, then so is her songwriting -- for every sexy rocker, there's a loving ballad that assures love and comfort. She seems to be balancing out Nova the nurterer with Nova the woman, and it works surprisingly well.  There are a few dud songs, such as "A Way to Live," which suffers from rather simplistic lyrics, and a vocal style that makes Nova sound a bit shrill. However, more often than not, the richness of her  vocals and the smooth instrumentation make these songs shine. While the acoustic guitar as the center of things, Nova also depends on trembling organ melodies and tinkling piano.  Heather Nova has grown up, and so has her music. "Red Bird" is one of her mellower albums, but has regained the sensuality and edge of her early work. This bird flies 
 Every library must have a copy of this book.  It teaches children what is really important in life.  People only need people and nothing else 
 This is certainly one of the best Atlantis shows to date. Another one was Common Ground. 
 There are several good, reliable guidebooks to the Philippines which give you basic information about places, accommodations, restaurants and so forth.  Jens Peters "Philippine Travel Guide" is especially comprehensive.  The Lonely Planet Guide is also very good.  But, the Rough Guide does something the others don't often do; the Rough Guide gives you frank comments on the relative quality of the destinations.  For example, from the other guidebooks you'll learn that Cebu City is the "Queen City of the South".  The Rough Guide gives a franker description, saying, "there's history and architecture in there somewhere, but you have to look hard for it among the clutter, the exhaust fumes and the nondescript concrete malls."  Don't get me wrong, I like Cebu City, but the Rough Guide lets the visitor know what to expect.  If they think a place is exceptionally attractive, they'll say so.  One of the most important functions of a guidebook is to help the trip-planning traveler discriminate between great places and mediocre ones.  If that's what your looking for, the Rough Guide is the best.  However, it does not cover nearly as many places and acommodations as does the thicker Philippine Travel Guide.  I'd choose the Rough Guide to plan my trip but take along the Philippine Travel Guide or Lonely Planet guide for their more extensive and detailed travel information 
 That a professor of philosophy should write a book on de Sade, an author decried by the prudish and dismissed as tedious and twisted by those who fail to engage themselves with his philosophical concerns, is without doubt a step forward for the arts. Airaksinen argues in particular detail concerning such matters as anti-ethics, the meaning of perversion, political implications and literary style, and in so doing makes de Sade's concepts accessible to those of us who have never been able to read an entire volume. The mixture of informal, Americanised English and highly technical philosophical terminology can wrong-foot the reader on occasions, but Airaksinen's own theories and the source material he has assembled make for a very valuable read.

 The band was unknown to me, unlike Mariachi Cobre and Los Camperos. All songs are very well played and the takes are excellent 
 The essays and wisdom of twenty teachers, "novice," "veteran" and "elder" in their craft, sheds light on our history of teaching black children.  Ms. Foster's book provides sound basis for the argument that "integration" is not a panacea. Perhaps "transformation" of our schools will enable us to be a free and democratic society devoted to the pride, dignity and education of all of our children. All teachers and teacher educators can learn much from the voices heard in this book 
 This is great for its intended use. Has all the info one needs to complete the class associated with it 
 I was a bit hesitant to listen to this book after reading so many negative reviews here.  Maybe it translates differently on audio than it did to the reviewers who read it on paper because I thought it was a wonderful and heartwarming story about two very likable journalists who find love and healing in the face of war's tragedies.  Secondary characters added further depth and interest, as do the detailed settings and the journalist's eyewitness descriptions of the more personal side of war.  Highly recommended 
 I found this book to be a wonderful source of ideas for design and technique. The mini quilts were very well photographed and I found the write-ups to be helpful and informative. As a fiber artist, I no longer want patterns or "projects", I just want inspiration. Perfect 
 This book has been the most accurate reference on Frame Relay I have foun 
 James Stewart wrote DisneyWar with the knowledge and support of Michael Eisner.  Eisner was initially reluctant to have an outsider see and write about the inner workings of Disney but apparently he overcame that reluctance.  Now he probably regrets it.  Not that it would have mattered in saving Eisner various high profile positions with the company.  Despite many early successes the first ten years the story of Disney -- especially since 1994 -- has been much more dramatic and truamatic than anything they have put on a screen.  As with all companies there are good decisions and there are bad decisions.  But it seems with Disney, since 1994, the bad outweighs the good.  EuroDisney has been a monumental bust.  Many of their productions have not done well.  The decision to buy Fox Family at far more than it was worth (I would love to see what Ruppert Murdoch's reaction was when Disney paid over $5 billion for that mistake) was another less than brilliant move.  The acquisition of ABC has been more troublesome than it was perhaps worth.  And on top of the Disney pyramid -- warts and all -- set Michael Eisner.  Stewart writes a scathing denunciation of the corporate Disney that most outsiders may hear only rumors and bits and pieces.  One had to figure that Eisner must have done something wrong to be ousted despite claims of great successes.  What did he and his entourage do wrong to earn the wrath of stockholders?  This book brings life to what could have been a dull study of corporate politics and in-fighting.  This book would make for an interesting movie -- one that I doubt Disney would produce 
 This is a great introduction to selling photography by one of the very best in the business. Jim Zuckerman is very diverse in his stock photography subject matter and that diversity shows through in the wide range of knowledge he shares in this book. The best coverage is on selling photography at art shows and advice on submitting article and calendar proposals to publishers. If you're specifically interested in stock agencies, I highly recommend Lee Frost's Photos That Sell (see my review on that book). Mr. Zuckerman's advice on stock libraries is a good introduction but Lee Frost devotes most of his book to the topic. The photography in the book is of course wonderful, but I would have liked to have seen the author share more information about which images were his best sellers, how many times each image has sold and where, and other details which Lee Frost shares in this book in many cases. However, this is very solid introduction to selling photography and I recommend it 
 With his thought provoking observations and comprehensive knowledge of the New Testament period, Allegro draws the reader into the evolving theology of the Essenes. His thesis is that Christianity evolved from more ancient roots than is typically credited in Western culture.  He paints a picture for us in which Judaic fundamentalists of the second or first century BCE, fed up with the corruption and "seeking after smooth things" of the religious establishment in Jerusalem, withdrew to the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea to found their own isolated community at Qumran. According to Allegro, with the death of their messianic Teacher of Righteousness at the hands of a Jewish king in 88 BCE, their understanding of their leader's role in Israel's history and their own salvation shifts from the Triumphant King model toward the Suffering Servant model. Allegro traces how their thinking might have evolved from triumphalist political aspirations for Israel's greatness as a nation to a mystical path to God for the individual based on gnosis -- one of the roots of the various gnostic sects which collectively may have represented the early stages of Christianity.  He follows the story on into the struggle for dominance that was eventually won by the "Great Church" (which we now know as the Catholic Church), tracing the consequences of the suppression of the various competing interpretations of Scriptures and traditions, including how those suppressed ideas and threads continued reviving and manifesting through the Middle Ages and even into modern times with the Protestant Reformation.  I found his perspective on the evolution of Western religious belief and practice fascinating 
 A big fun book for getting seeing how your body works.  I like all the big colorful drawings and the close-up microscopic views of things like cells, hormones, bacteria, etc... It is fun to read about real life experiences  e.g. learn how the immune system when you're sick.. 
 The Recovery Project of Arte Públio Press was instrumental in our contemporary knowledge of this book.  Though published in 1885, the text had not been acknowledged.  Sánchez's and Pita's introduction is very detailed, and provides a lot of contextual information that the Modern Library edition does not provide.  Arte Público Press is the greatest publisher of US Latino literature, and the Press first brought Amparo Ruiz de Burton's text to the contemporary public.  I wonder why it was necessary to bring out another edition, as the Modern Library did, given that Arte Público Press was able to contextualize its text within the area of US expansion, manifest destiny, and domesticity.  The scholarship in the Arte Público Edition is first rate, as are all the introductions in these series.    ARte Público also published, by Ruiz de Burton, _Conflicts of Interest: The Letters of María Amparo Ruiz de Burton_ and _Who Would Have Tought It_? both edited by Rosaura Sánchez and Beatric Pita.  It makes no sense that anybody would buy the Modern Library edition, given the seriously rooted, hitorically discursive scholarhip of the Arte Público edition 
 I love Prince.  I also love the choices Amazon gives me:  used or new, the price, and delivery time are just excellent.  Thank you,  bfayn 
 Yes, this is a wonderful adoption story, but beyond that it is just a great story about acceptance, family & love. I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is already a favorite at my house! 
 This book helped my son overcome his fear of going number two.  Psychologically, kids often are afraid to poop beacause they think that a part of their body is coming out!  This wonderful book really helped him overcome his fear.  Now if we can only get him to remember to flush the toilet... 
 Hunter Drohojowska-Philp is a sound writer, one who obviously does her research inexhaustibly, and with a background in art criticism she also speaks with authority and an informed eye. But she does go on....  For those who want to know more about the idiosyncrasies of this American idol then this is the resource of choice. We learn more about the frustrations, self doubt, love affairs, and general personality quirks than in all the other biographies combined. We also learn about each painting in depth which I suppose is like a verbal catalogue raissonne and for that we should be thankful.  It is just that with all great artists not everything they make is of show quality and it is this inclusion of all of the odds and major ends of O'Keeffe's work that borders on tiresome. It is with a good degree of relief that the last page of this nearly 500-page opus is reached.  Hunter Drohojowska-Philp obviously holds Georgia O'Keeffe in a realm close to Valhalla and that is all well and good. She writes with vigor and determination and certainly informs us of the 'full bloom' of her title. In the end this is a valuable volume for the archives, but not a book to recommend for the casual reader who has already grown visually fatigued with the Santa Fe posters of poppies, ox skulls, and datura flowers.

 Last Man standing is about a FBI agent named Web London in a division called HRT or Hostage Rescue Team.  He is a grizzled veteran in the department that somehow avoided being killed with his comrades and friends in a ambush style killing in DC.  Accused of cowardice in a now scandalized department, a now disenfranchised and disillusioned Web London sets down a path to clear his name that at a point branches off into 3 separate stories before converging back into one in a highly dramatic and well written novel.  I never read anything by David Baldacci before Last Man Standing however after finishing the book it leaves me wanting to read more from him.  It is truly a book that you will not want to put down 
 This is a timeless classic everyone should own.  Sample In Your Eyes and Don't Give Up.  Peter Gabriel delivers with this standard classic.  
 Dr. Edward Tick has written a book that gathers wisdom from our mythic ancestors about healing the aftermath of war. As a Viet Nam Veteran I have suffered with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD and Dr. Ticks  book War and the Soul has been the only out of many books I have read that truly address the fact that PTSD is a wound that occurs in the soul of the soldier.  I have needed this kind of healing for forty years. During the time of reading the book I wept too many times to count. I have yellow highlighted more than half the book. I am a practicing psychotherapist and believe that the essence of what is needed to heal our veteran's wounds has been excavated out of history and illuminated by Dr. Tick. His articulate understanding and collection of experiences with veterans makes his work invaluable to those who have the courage to recover their souls. I believe as Dr. Tick does that PTSD is an identity disorder.  Dr. Tick proposes that the ancient role of warrior is one our veterans need today in order to bring meaning and direction back into their lives. In today's world warrior are intensely needed 
 When I read this cook book I realize how things are just pass down through generations. Regardless if you've been born in this country. The cooking styles are the same and I soon realize how the women in my family cook must of the food that's in this book... This is an amazing book and Thank You too the Chef!!! It just brings back memories....:-)

He loves it and has a great time listening to the sounds, as well as putting the bugs in the frogs mouth and pulling them out of the frog's belly.Excellent hands on toy for toddlers which lends itself to more sophisticated learning as your child progresses 
 The Hicks, Hicks and Mole book is well written and represents with a good degree of accuracy the Five Element material taught to students of J. R. Worsley who studied at his College of Traditional Acupuncture in Royal Leamington Spa, England.  This style of acupuncture was taught to students with consistent content for over 20 years.  The authors have expanded the material in terms of background information from the Chinese Classics and have included at the end of the book some material which integrates the Five Element System with TCM principles; but the Five Element material remains true to Dr. Worsley's teachings at least up until he left the College in 1994.  The book is well worth reading by all practitioners interested in the body, mind and spirit care of their patients, not least by those of us who now miss contact with Dr. Worsley's gifted influence.

 This is a delightful little film that owes more than a passing nod to Richard Curtis' films like Four Weddings and Love Actually. There's even Matthew Goode doing his best faux-Hugh Grant impersonation, which some may find just a little irritating because it suggests the real thing but lacks Grant's range as an actor.  This lack of depth means we never sympathise quite as much as we should with his predicament, namely that the woman he loves is in love with another woman.   Nevertheless, the film is a charming diversion and the direction is impeccable with never a slack moment or an unnecessary shot.  The romantic relationship between the two female leads is delicately developed and there's thankfully no politically correct posturing or quasi-erotic exploitation - in fact if anything this film lacks the tug of desire that would make more compelling the women's need to be with each other.   Piper Perabo, playing Rachael the innocent newly-wed, turns in a workmanlike performance but this isn't a film that demands much of her so her talent is largely dormant here.  The real surprise is Anthony Head playing Rachael's father, whose late-in-the-day confession steals not just the scene but practically the whole film too.    All in all a thoroughly enjoyable film that demands little but delivers the feel-good factor in spades 
 When I got A Case of Need by Michael Crichton, I had extremely low expectations. This was Crichton's first novel, written in 1968, and he was only 26. However this was not the case. The novel was much better then I expected.   The novel revolves around a pathologist named Dr. John Berry. Dr. Berry's friend has recently been arrested for murdering a girl who comes from one of the leading medical families in Boston from a bad abortion. Dr. Berry investigates to find out the truth.  This is a good story that gives the reader an inside look into the medical industry in 1968. This book is certainly entertaining 
 If there's anyone on your gift list unlucky enough to own the entire series of unfortunate events, you may wish to inflict further adversity upon them by purchasing this additional volume for their collection.  Not so much a book as a mystery contained between hard covers, this most attractively presented publication contains two folders, one with a large two-sided poster filled with clues, and a notebook containing correspondence exchanged between a guy named Lemony Snicket and what seems to be two people named Beatrice Baudelaire, one of whom claims to be a fourth Baudelaire sibling.  The letters begin before The Bad Beginning and end sometime after The End.  It soon becomes evident that the notebook contains many clues, and from the cover we learn that these clues are "suspiciously linked to Book the Thirteenth". The most obvious puzzle is the anagram using the punch out letters, but there's no way in heck that anybody's going to ruin the notebook by actually doing that.  There are several solutions to the anagram, two of which contain names, the simplest one seeming to tie in with the poster illustration, and the other one connected through the correspondence.  Even the cover has an illustrated surprise which could also be a clue.  Conspiracy buffs will have a field day with this one, which is a lot trickier that it looks.  For instance the occupation "baticeer" (someone who trains bats) won't be found in the dictionary, and the poem "My Silence Knot" is also a puzzle.  It's highly unlikely that I'll be any closer to revealing any secrets by the time "The End" comes out next month, so I guess I'll just have to wait and see.  In the interim, this one gets full marks for originality and presentation.   Amanda Richards, September 17, 2006 
 I also Love this movie! I got the VHS,but I want the DVD.I love the scene where The puppies are barking at Thunderbolt The Wonderdog.I wonder who will win between Krypto The Superdog and Thunderbolt The Wonderdog. I also loved the Saturday Morning TV-show. I loved the episode where Lucky saved Dumpling's life. I also loved the episode where Cruella had her own tv talk show and called the audience,a bunch of "Gum chewing maniacs" or something like that. and I forgot what she called Muldoona.  
 hitler wanted too raise the old celtic and viking tribes of the middle ages back too life thus so he created the  ss which its orgin comes from the gauls(the celts)and also the suicide knights of the crusades there were different groups of the SS your basic field soldier and your cops and also guards  even tank divisons,paratroopers the most highest honored unit in the ss were the Deaths head -or suicide soldier aka death soldier.so i say before you go and say the ss were not human go read the book on the vikings or the celts they acted the very same way its called middle age warfare a person who begs for there life isnt worth living the russians also believed in no surrender fight too the last man which in most cases they did so i end this with saying im damn proud too be germanic celtic im also american but i caNT put down my ancestors like that i have huge respect for the SS and the old german military them and russians were real soldiers .too say something else most of the german units and ss were on the eastern front fighting the russians probably the most brutal fighting front of the whole wa 
 I think this is the novel where Chandler started to take his press clippings seriously and tried to write an Important Book.  While it's a very good book,  the book feels like a lesser sequel to his previous four classic novels perhaps because it strays a little more from its pulp roots.  In the earlier books, he showed us the seamy side of Los Angeles, and the characters demonstrated their basic corruption through their actions.  There is some of that in this novel as well, but he also feels the need to tell us what Philip Marlowe actually thinks about your average person. "Tired men in dusty coupes and sedans winced and tightened their grip on the wheel and ploughed on north and west toward home and dinner, the whining of their spoiled children and the gabble of their silly wives."  True, probably.  Pleasant, no.  Marlowe also occasionally indulges in self pity. A flawed hero is one thing; an unlikable one is something else altogether.   There's no leavening the unpleasantness as even Marlowe himself doesn't come off well.  As misanthropic as Marlowe becomes in this novel, you wonder why he even bothers to do his Don Quixote thing.  In this book, I think Chandler strays somewhat from his original concept of Marlowe, and the book suffers as a result.  Still a good read, but far from classic.        
 This is the original.  If you are looking for a man's magazine that is insightful, thought provoking, entertaining, and a great buy, look no further.  Esquire has been around a long time and one of the reasons for its great success is that it has a certain 'feel' to it that transcends time.  Yet it is right on the cutting edge of today's issues.  Magazines like Maxim, Stuff, and FHM will never be in the class of Esquire because their appeal is strictly 'shock-value.'  Basically if you have seen one of them, you've seen them all.  They offer nothing new, and most of the content is pretty crass.    Esquire, on the other hand entertains while making you think about a wide range of issues.  There is always something in Esquire that makes you want to pick it up and actually read what's between the covers.  Yet it still has its own unique style.  The subscription price is huge bargain.  You can't go wrong with it 
 This is a great book to use. The approaches uses the techniques from Adlerian concepts as well as reality therapy and REBT. It is used for techniques in the classroom. Eassy reading like a workbook and inexpensive.  Great Job Linda. Looking fiward to your next additio 
 First and foremost I would like to congratulate Yo Gotti on his come up from the albums Life and Selft-Explanatory to now b/c I definitely see the maturity. 2nd,I would like to comment on the prev review that gave this album a bad rating and said Gotti thinks he put Memphis on the map. As a Memphis native and big fan of Gotti, on Gotti's album he acknowledges other Memphis rappers such as Eight-ball, MJG,& Project Pat letting his fans know that throughout his struggle these were the ones as well as others that were representing Memphis to the fullest and he's just trying to continue to get his city hot. This CD is a great album if you're all about being REAL, either experienced the fast life & can relate, trying to come up on great success, or just want to rep the M 
 This is probably the Velvet's least satisfactory album, but its still an essential rock 'n' roll document, and is a shame that it wasn't released during the band's brief lifespan. "VU" is certainly lighter and more traditional rock 'n' roll than every other Velvet album, as the songs sound like really primative early 60s pop-rock songs. That may be why this is the least popular Velvet album, because there isn't nearly as much sonic nihilism or experimentation as the other albums. That isn't to say there is no musical exploration on this album, as the songs point twords both the later power-pop movements and the punk rock scene with its lo-fi recording techniques. The most experimental tracks are the softer and more minimalist ones such as "Ocean". The reason why this isn't as influential as the other albums is because it wasn't released, which is a shame, and even when it finally was made availible to the public, few took notice. That is a shame, because even if its not up to the standards of "VU & Nico", what really is? Its a good rock 'n' roll album, proving that the Velvet couldn't make any poor album (I haven't heard "Squeeze", but its without Lou Reed so it really doesn't count) 
 Felt's "Felt, Vol. 2: A Tribute To Lisa Bonet" is a very very good album, but it DOES have a couple flaws. The most notable one is the rapper - he's just not that good or charismatic. He'll get the job done, sure, but I can definitely see a lot of people not really liking him. What saves the album is that every song is good (though some are pretty offensive, not that I entirely care that much, however - see "Breaker Down Like A Shotgun" for a good example), and that the production is usually great (see "Morris Day" for a great example). The production blends interesting elements of dub, electronica and jazz in a lot of places - you'll find a lot of it interesting if-not-pretty-catchy. Another downside to the album is that the songs aren't really deep at all, though you'll still probably like to listen to the lyrics anyway. Overall I think rap fans will really like this album, though I wouldn't call it a classic. I don't think non-rap fans will like this that much. All things aside, however, this is highly recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album! 
 This book is very put together for impact, and I got teary throughout my reading.  It's amazing the work that people did to get the animals out of danger, but the entire time, while it is a hopeful book, one can only imagine how many weren't able to be saved.  The page on cats, in particular, made me sad, as they mention how hard it was to rescue cats compared to dogs, as they wouldn't come when called.  The photos are great, and the stories of rescue are extremely heartwarming.  It's an inspiring book written by some great people.  I wish it could have been longer and more detailed, but it's great anyway 
 This is considered one of the four great books on the Battle of the Bulge.  The others are John Toland's Battle, Hugh Cole's official US Army History:  The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge and Charles B. MacDonald's A Time for Trumpets.   I have read all but Hugh Cole's book and will review each of them.  The Bitter Woods starts with a good background of the breakout from the Normandy beachhead and takes you up the start of the Bulge.  Eisenhower gives you a strategic view of the events leading up to the Bulge.  He discusses the strategy that the Allies were using against the Germans. His book gives you much more background of the operations before the Bulge than either Toland's or MacDonald's.    As this book was written in 1968, the knowledge of the Enigma intercepts was not released yet.  Eisenhower is still able to discuss the deception operation that the Germans were able to successfully conduct against the Allies.    Once Eisenhower gets to the battle he does a good job of taking you to soldier level battles.  MacDonald does a better job but he doesn't set the strategic context as well as Eisenhower.  All of these books are detailed enough that they keep you referring to the maps to understand what was happening.  Eisenhower also gives more details of other events that happened during and after the the Bulge such as the German offensive Operation Nordwind.  Finally Eisenhower shows the strategy that led to the end of the war in Europe.  Eisenhower provides many details about the leadership.  He personally knew them and his father was able to provide many personal details.   While Eisenhower knew both General Omar Bradley and Field Marshall Montgomery, I felt he did a pretty good job of describing the personality conflict between them and did not defer from taking on the issue.  If you are looking for a good book on the Battle of Bulge that places it in its historical context, discusses the leadership, and gives you the big view as well as individual actions, the Bitter Woods is the best book of the three.

 Like a blast of cold air in the middle of a stifling hot room, so is Canadian-raised singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's ground-breaking album.  Jagged Little Pill is the epitome of everything a rock record should be: hard, listenable and, most importantly, marketable to the masses.  From the opening track in which Morissette declares "All I Really Want" to the blisteringly explicit "You Oughta Know," this chick makes a listener really listen.  Her intriguing and unique instrument cuts through all the typical froo-froo bells and whistles heard in the day by then-chart rulers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, giving radio a new voice that is both expressionistic and genuine; this woman has been hurt by men and she's going to let you know how much, man!  Whether you've fallen "Head Over Feet," think things "Ironic" or just need to be "Forgiven," Jagged Little Pill is a pill everyone should swallow 
 the search for “Planet X” by various astronomers.  A significant highlight of that search was the announcement in December 1983 by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory that IRAS (the infra-red telescope) has found a planet, much larger than Earth, moving in the distant heavens in our direction.  The announcement – hastily retracted as a “misunderstanding” – prompted the Reagan-Gorbachov meetings and President Reagan’s speech at the U.N. about the common danger to Mankind from “an alien planet out there.”  a video presentation of Reagan’s speech (and Soviet video footage concerning the Phobos Incident), and to a never-before-shown video of my interview of the astronomer who was in charge of the official U.S. government search for Planet X -- Dr. Robert Harrington at the United States Naval Observatory.  Speaking of the planet as a matter-of-fact, Dr. Harrington described it as 2 -3 times the size or mass of Earth, with an atmosphere, “habitable;” Dr. Harrington died suddenly soon after the interview - August 199 
 i've had my camera for almost 2 years now. it's great. i haven't had any problems with it, no lcd cracking or the purple stuff. i have dropped my camera before, from i would say about 4ft+ onto the cement and it barely left a dent, and it still works as good as new. the picture quality is awesome and also the video feature is really good. i love it. but the ONE con is that there is no battery indicator thing, it only blinks low battery when it's about to die, but the pros about this camera definitely weighs out that one con.   ALSO, from a few of the reviews i have read, some people said that you'd have to take extremely good care of this camera because it's really sensitive. but honestly, i haven't been taking care of my camera. i don't carry it in a case and i always either have it in the back pocket of my pants or in my purse or i'll just hold it in my hand and actually it's been banged around a couple of times, but i hardly have any scratches on it except the tiny dent from that one time i dropped it.  PROS:  durable small lcd screen is huge it doesn't lag it's cute excellent picture/video quality long battery life  CONS: no battery indicator  i DEFINITELY reccomend this camera to everyone :) 
 This book was wonderful.  Very funny and I love the cover.  Great ending too. 
  My own experiences concur with this book as I have traveled down many spiritual paths, each one a very different experience. William James gives a satisfying intellectual framework within which to understand differing religious experiences. Reading his words is a good corrective to the current PC notion that "there is but one Mountain and many paths to the top." Nonsense. There are as many mountains as there are paths. You will be pleased with the purchase of this book, as it will be one you will have occasion to refer to again and again.  Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!  
 Beautiful narrative style. Shows the history and the politics behind some of the most deadly "bugs" out there. Want to know about the diseases up to 1995,then this is it. Huge notes section with indepth index. All this packed into 750 pages. 
   During the first few minutes of "Porco Rosso", I was thinking, 'okay, this is.....different.  It's good but I don't think it's exactly gonna be "Spirited Away" or "Naussicaa"'.  I should have known better.  It IS different, it's not "Spirited Away" or any other Ghibli movie before or since, but it is, in its own bizarre way, just as good.  Studio Ghibli seems to be incapable of delivering anything short of true excellence.     The title character is a grumpy bipedal pig who flies a World War I-era airplane in the Mediterranean in the years between the two world wars.  Once human, Porco has adopted an air of disinterested apathy to cover his feelings, but he finds himself drawn to a group of people in Italy after his plane is shot down by a rival pilot, rendering Porco unable to make a living protecting transport and passenger ships from pirates - some of the most gloriously incompetent pirates imaginable, by the way.  "Porco Rosso' is suitable viewing for the kiddies but may be, in general, enjoyed more by an older audience - in addition to the soaring air battles and action-packed climax, there's plenty of romance, dry humor, and subtle political commentary.  Regardless, it has the Ghibli charm, and is likely to have something for almost everyone.  A truly one-of-a-kind movie (ask youself this: when was the last time you saw a movie about a trenchcoat, goggles and fedora-wearing pig piloting a brightly painted red airplane and fighting sky pirates?) and another jewel in the glorious Ghibli crown 
 There are many gorgeous photos of both the insides and outsides of public and personal spaces. I was actually surprised at the number of homes we get a peek into. If you enjoy interior design, of just about any style, you will find it here. I love all the personal libraries shown, crammed with books and interesting objects. Loved the mannequins, esp the life-sized guy sitting on the couch. I am a fan of exotic, eclectic decorating and found many examples to keep me happy with the book 
 "The Prose of the Trans-Siberian" poem remains my favorite piece of Cendrars writing but this novel is a close second. I passed my copy around and everyone that had a go at it praised the thrills it delivers. Cendrars is a character who seems to have known everyone and been everywhere during those wild experimental years at the beginning of the last century. He documented his many careers(he had a go at just about every art form) in four volumes of biography. Three of which I think are available. He also lost a hand in WW1 and wrote a very beautiful poem about it, such is the magnanimity of this soul who was such a restless originator of new forms it seems he could have single handedly brought about modernism all on his own. Of course his many friends (of which Picasso was one) did what they could too. As a poet his reputation is solid, as a novelist he is still gaining ground as his books begin to reappear after a long abscence. Moravagine is a book full of anarchic energy and though one of the main characters is a bit primitive that was after all one of the aspects of modernism. The wild beast of a main character is Cendrars monster or more specifically modern societies monster. There is also a monkey who is curiously human. The writing is manic at times but there are few lulls on this cross continental journey where the primitive and the civilized seem to walk hand in hand . If this was made into a picture it would be a road picture replete with half man half beast lead, civilized man narrator, and well clad monkey companion. Cendrars family album 
 Eugenides has created something special in _Middlesex_. It's an epic story, spanning nearly a century, two continents and multiple cultures. Yet it is no dry history, but instead is a very personal, vivid and carefully defined story.  Eugenides writes like an ecstatic shaman, spinning a yarn that is at once weirdly fantastic and unmistakably realistic. From the narrator's nonchalantly hash-smoking grandfather to the portly freakshow operator who laughs jovially while coldly assessing "what" Cal/Calliope actually is, Eugenides succeeds in making sense out of a world of contradictions and conflicts. There are no black-and-white characters in this book; it's all about grey areas and compromises.  But there's no preaching or sermonizing. Eugenides asks many of the big questions, and leaves the tragicomedy of life itself to suggest the answers. From race riots to sectarian brutality, _Middlesex_ puts the imperfect world on display without attempting to judge it. And it does so good-naturedly, through the hopeful, analytic eyes of Cal/Callie, an endearingly flawed creature the reader cannot help but love and admire.  If there's a moral to this tale, it's that people cannot escape their own genes, their history, or their fate ... yet their choices along the way make all the difference between a life wasted and a life worth living. Eugenides juxtaposes despair and idealism to produce the impossible results of hope and joy.  If there's a downside to this book, it's that the editors didn't rein in Eugenides's literary rambling a bit more. The writer obviously loves language. He revels in playing with words and strumming the chords of meaning, with thought-provoking and delightful results. But sometimes he seems to forget about the story for pages at a time, so he can wax poetic about the number of vowels in a president's name, or the soul-extinguishing efficiency of Henry Ford's assembly line. But some of the more self-indulgent passages can safely be skimmed, without diminishing the beauty of this irreverent, unflinching, artful creation.  I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because it needs a tighter edit. But in truth, it merits the 4.5 stars reflected in the averaged rating. Great book, highly recommended. If you have trouble with the first few chapters,  or if the sprawling prose gets tedious, hang in there and do some speed-reading. It gets much better, and by the end you will be savoring every page in this beautiful monstrosity 
 My suggestion is to read this book first if you are thinking of taking flying lessons.  If and when you start flying lessons you of course will pilot the plane and become familiar with the controls, but during the flying lessons in the air you will also be involved in dealing with what seems like an overwhelming amount of other information. The plane seems small and strange. It is cramped and a bit noisy. There are many instruments. Often you will be thrown about if there is some weather. And the instructor might be yelling command plus you must communicate with others by radio. So there are many things unfamiliar and they must be absorbed and then the lesson is over quickly - or so it seems. All of the details are important but before you start it helps if you can develop an intuitive feel for how a plane moves and is lifted in the air.  The aim of the book is to explain in simple terms the physics of flight and to develop within the reader an intuitive feel for air flight. Flying is a three dimensional activity and does not come easily or obviously. The ideas about the control of flight can become somewhat intuitive if you read this book. It presents flying in its basics without the hype - in a way in which you can visualize flying - and can start develop the intuition and the appreciation.  Four or five stars 
 I am a huge John Grisham fan.  I believe the first Grisham book I ever read was "The Pelican Brief".  After that, I was hooked.  I admit that through the years Mr. Grisham's work has become less "Grishamisc" and not as entertaining as earlier works.  But, you'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does.    I first started this book by listening to it on CD.  I soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it.  I was right!  The book starts out with action and pulls you in.  The action barely lets up through the entire book.  This is a different kind of action.  More mental than physical.  There seems to always be something going on and Grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter.  One thing that is very different about this book than most of his works, is that there isn't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve.  Generally, we find Grisham leading us to a thriller ending.  However, in this book, it is more of a life lesson about greed.  There is no bad guy, nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character, etc.  The book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life.    The characters are likeable and easy to follow.  There are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story.  I found the book very easy to read and follow.  I always wanted more.    Although the book has a different theme than most Grisham books, I still really enjoyed it.  It reminded me why I like to read his books so much.  It proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending.    If you like this one, try the eariler works as well.  If you have seen the movies, it doesn't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way.  This book would make a good movie, but we'll see if anyone in Hollywood agrees with me on that point.    Happy reading 
 I would give this album 4.5 stars.  Not too many people have heard of these guys, and I just happened to stumble upon them one day.  I picked this album up at a Newbury Comics, and I must say that the sky is the limit for this band.  Their songs are so patient and beautiful, while not lacking a sense of urgency (Bitten by the Tailfly comes to mind).  I would say that anyone who is a fan of music should get this.  Comparisons to Radiohead and Coldplay are common place, but Elbow IS their own band.  Check it out 
 I read this book and found it impossible not to love.  The stories may be odd, but none are boring.  And the ones that have a twist to them are very impressive.  This book keeps you reading.  And I recommend this to any age 
 This book has a wealth of guidance for anyone planning any large family gatherings.  It covers all the details necessary for any type of event and all that is needed in planning that event. The book is so comprehensive-it is to a family reunion what a wedding planner is to a wedding!  I highly recommend it 
 _The Other Founders_ by Saul Cornell provides a good overview of a unique American political tradition which began in opposition to the ratification of the Constitution.  Antifederalists opposed the Constitution on different grounds, including especially the need for a Bill of Rights ammendment.  Antifederalists also came to emphasize the rights of states and localism within government, opposing the strong centralizing tendencies within the Constitution and which existed after the Constitution was ratified.  Individuals such as Jefferson and Madison came to embrace certain aspects of the Antifederalist tradition in their opposition to the centralizing tendencies of Hamilton, who proposed to create among other things a centralized banking system.  Many of the original Antifederalists feared the influence of a large centralized government, maintaining that such a thing could lead to the promotion of an aristocracy who would operate against the interests of the common people.  The tradition of Antifederalism continues to play an important part in constitutional debate today.  Many have looked towards this tradition as a means for protecting the rights of states as well as Second Ammendment rights to private gun ownership from the influence of the federal government

 I cannot think of another writer whose prose reads with as much poetic power as Emerson.  The poetic aspect comes from the richness of meaning that continue to manifest as one lingers and thinks about the words Emerson writes rather than anything contrived or artsy.  He created many powerful sentences and phrases that still live in the American spirit, and yet, for all the ringing words we love and hold close there are many thoughts and arguments that many people, including myself, find difficult to accept on any level other than being by Emerson.    For all that we love in Self-Reliance and The American Scholar, we still have to deal with his mystic essay on the Over-soul.  Many conservative Christians have problems with his Transcendentalist views of religion and Christ.  Reading his thoughts on "The Lord's Supper" might be interesting simply because it is Emerson.  However, most orthodox believers will not come close to being convinced and today's non-believers will find it difficult to work up the energy to try and figure out what the fuss is about.  His famous essays collected under the title of Nature are fascinating and poetic views of the natural world.  At least they seem that way to our more technical age.  We see his Enlightenment confidence in reason and man's ability to discover the mechanisms of the Universe.  While our science is remains rational, it is not quite so confident that everything can be easily discovered.  We have found that for every depth we sound we discover that the bottom is only apparent.  Things are deeper and stranger than the thinkers of Emerson's time ever dreamed.  This volume collects his essays and lectures into more than 1,100 pages of fascinating and wonderful reading.  His poems and translations are collected into a separate volume also offered through the wonderful Library of America (don't hesitate to support them).  The volume opens with a collection called "Nature; Addresses, and Lectures" and contains the eight chapters of Nature plus the four addresses The American Scholar, An Address to the Senior Class of Divinity College from 1838, Literary Ethics, and The Method of Nature.  It also has five lectures: Man the Reformer, Introductory Lecture on the Times, The Conservative, The Transcendentalist, and The Young American.  There are then two collections of essays that contain famous titles such as History, Self-Reliance, The Over-Soul, The Poet, Manners, and Nature [yeah, I know it can get confusing].  This is followed by a collection called Representative Men.  The seven chapters here are wonderful, but I cannot imagine anything like them being written today.  The first chapter is titled "Uses of Great Men".  I think I can here the deconstructionists swallowing their tongues.  Then follows a chapter each for Plato the Philosopher, Swedenborg the Mystic [millions ask, WHO?], Montaigne the Skeptic, Shakespeare the poet, Napoleon the Man of the World, and Goethe the Writer.    The last two collections contain a number of short papers on English Traits and The Conduct of life.  All interesting and full of Emersonian insight and beauty of language.  The volume concludes with a Chronology of Emerson's life, notes on the texts, other notes, and an alphabetical index of titles (which is particularly useful given the re-use and similarity of some of these titles) 
 I saw the Retrospective show at the Art Gallery of Ontario back in 1999 and bought the book right after at the gallery bookstore. I later went back and saw the show two more times and also read the book from cover to cover. IT IS FABULOUS. It is no wonder Cindy Sherman is considered to be one of the top ten most influential artists of the 20th century. I especially love the notes in the book, showing how she arranges her ideas, how she deliberately uses feminism and ideas that are disgusting in order to make her social statements. Her artwork is deliberately controversial and its not for all people. (Jerry Falwell once said that Sherman was "spawn of the devil", but who actually listens to him?) But if you like controversy and if you like artwork that makes you think, buy this book. - A Fellow Artist 
 I don't normally do this, but for this CD I will make an exception...I am going to go down the list and state why I like/dislike all the songs and score them from 1-10.  Ready?  1.  Don't Forget About Us - Mariah Carey - 8 probably my favorite new song of MARIAH's. 2.  StickWitU - PCD - 7 1/2 - I like sentimental PCD, but I like fun PCD better. 3.  Grillz - Nelly - 4 - A song about a mouth piece??? come on now. 4.  Run It - Chris Brown - 7 1/2 - Like a young Usher, but not quite as good. 5.  My Hump - BEP - 7 - Good, yet slightly annoying. 6.  If It's Lovin' That You Want - Rihanna - 5 - All her songs sound the same. 7.  Fresh Azimiz - Bow Wow - 3 - Definately not WOW. 8.  Lean Wit it Rock Wit it - Dem Franchize Boyz - 1 - Most annoying, bad song on the CD. 9.  Stay Fly - Three 6 Mafia - 2 - Almost as bad as the BOYZ. 10.

All in all, I would reccomend this CD for your collection, I've added it to mine. : 
 This CD smokes. It's got a lewd, hip-shaking boogie-beat, atmosphere thicker than Louisiana fog, production that emphasizes the beat, molasses-thick lyrics that don't aspire to profundity --- yeah, "Lafayette Marquis" is the good times music you've been looking for. The late-night alternative to Bryan Ferry or Barry White. The worthy successor to Dr. John, Z.Z. Top and John Fogarty.  C.C. Adcock hails --- that's the word for guys like this --- from Lafayette, Louisiana. That's Cajun country, west of Baton Rouge. Average rainfall: 61 inches a year. On rainy days in his childhood, little Charlie Adcock learned to play guitar. By 14, he had a band --- Boogie Chillun' --- that he remembers as "a rhythm and blues Menudo." He played with Bo Diddley and toured with  Buckwheat Zydeco. Good connections got him a record deal, and a much-praised first CD.  A decade passed, and now we have "Lafayette Marquis." Well, he is a nobleman --- at least in his clothes. He likes  custom-made suits and expensive shoes (the reptilian pattern on the CD cover is from his boots). But when he talks about his songs, he's no gent. One song, for him, is "a score to a cock-fighting scene --- it's about a couple of oilfield, renegade, ruffneck podnuhs of mine."  How fun a guy is C.C. Adcock? Listen to him talk about his home town: "On any given night, you can start out in the country with some food, drop in to a Cajun dance hall and watch the old folks glidin' round the floor, then put the top down and jump back into town and rock around to the new sounds of some up-and-coming-cats. Then, you can cross the tracks and bump at a Zydeco disco, have a few Crown & Sevens and -- at the end of the night -- head south to another Parish where they stay open all night, and you can boogie `til daybreak in front of a classic swamp-pop jukebox and still make it home in time for Mass. And that's not even a fairy tale night."  This CD is like the souvenir of such a night. A monster of a car --- an old Mercury with a sleek V-8 under the hood. A VFW hall you almost can't see through the foggy night. Women in cotton dresses, men in jeans. Beer in bottles. And on stage, a powerhouse band, playing tight songs about loose females. A crazy fiddler gives the boogie some Cajun twang. The drum sounds hollow as a barrel. The bass player drives the beat like a steam engine. And above it, C.C. sings lyrics that are family-friendly only because they're too slurred to hear.  Get the party started. 
  This is a book that describes the essence of family. It is about being there for each other. It is about loving through bad and good times. It is about a bond that cannot be broken by miles or time, and it goes beyond blood. That is the message one receives upon reading this very introspective book. It also gives a closer look at the Gore family, and the love Al and Tipper shared with their own children. So many times those on the right in this country who beat their Bibles, try to preach to people that they corner the market on family, love, and morality. They only show their intolerance however, by attacking a family man and real Christian like Al Gore, who sees Christ's message of loving thy neighbor as thyself and puts it into action. A family is a mother, father, and children, yes, but it can also be an Aunt, an Uncle, or a friend. Anyone who gives us the love and support we need, and nurtures us through the important days of our lives, is our family. Al and Tipper Gore weaved this theme well in their book, Joined At The Heart, and they touched mine 
 I originally ordered the collection to obtain LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN, a play written by Oscar Wilde, inspired by the life of Lillie Langtry, and offered to Lillie Langtry for the original stage production - which she refused for reasons of 'vanity'.  The play is very well done.  I was also interested in viewing THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.  I was only familiar with the Hollywood version of the film.  This version, in my opinion, outshines the Hollywood version one thousand fold.  Very well done, and very well casted.  
 Ciscopress have released yet another jem of a book, really great read and easy to understand, the two authors known in the introduction as the Two Gert's do a splendid job of describing all the major security concerns you should be fully aware of, this book is highly recommnded and is authored by some very experienced engineers at Cisco -- you will not be dissappointed  Henry Sydney Australi 
 I bought this for a Christmas present for my girlfriend because she has always wanted one, and she loves it. She used to have one, of those egg crates on her bed, which isn't very comfortable, and I have even slept on, it myself, and it makes a world, of difference. I used to not like her bed at all because, I didn't think it was comfortable, but now that's all changed thanks to the Pillow Top Queen Fiberbed 
 If your a Garfield fan this book is a must!  It's great!!  It gives you lots of info on what's become of Garfield over the years.  Jim Davis is the "King of Humor" to have come up with so many funny ideas.  I was a fan when I was growing up and now my step-kids are all fans thanks to all my old books. I bought this book for the kids but I ended up reading it as well.  This book is the link of where Garfield came from, and celabrates his wonderful 25 years. Thanks for making people laugh for so many years all around the world Jim Davis 
 This album is everything that all the acclaim has stated it to be and more. This album captures Otis at his rawest. Each song is immortalized by an achingly powerful perfomace by Redding. Booker T. and the MG's demonstrate constantly why they are held as the greatest house band in history. True it may be comprised of several singles but that does not take away from the sheer force and totality of this masterpiece. It encompasses the very essense of not only Otis Redding but deep soul in general. Whether he's singing heartbreaking despair in the form of "Ole Man Trouble" or rousing near franctic up-tempo numbers like Sam Cooke's classic "Shake" the raw intensity never fails. I have two complaints about this album though. One,It should have had at least one more deep soul ballad and the second, though very small, is that "I've Been Loving You Too Long" should have followed "A Change Is Gonna Come." By having "Down In the Valley" follow 'Change' it shifts too fast from the deep power of Redding's take of the classic. Overall this album deserves to be higher than the superlatives have hailed it. If you love this and deep soul in general get James Carr's "You Got My Mind Messed Up." These are two of the deepest albums in history, Carr's, in my opinion, is more intense. Absolutely Essential :o 
 Reading this book is having an immediate effect on our peace of mind.  Our empathy muscles are growing and our own reactions to temporarily crazy behavior are increasingly sane.  The windows of communication are beginning to open as we share our mistakes, dreams & apologize for our occasionally nutty behavior.  When the 13 yr. who's forced against her will to live with us 1/3 of the time expressed an undercurrent of resentment toward "that book that says your kid is nuts" I mentioned that we were learning more about what the brain does between ages 12 & 20 and described some of the craziness as "hiccups" which are beyond teenager's control. Her face & body relaxed and she opened a window into her soul: "Can you imagine what it's like when 12 of us are hanging out at the lunch table and these hiccups are happening to some of us at the same time?  We have to keep kicking people out and then letting them back in when they're better. 
 I have now read all of Sedaris' books (just finished dress your family in Corduroy and Denim), and I have loved them all.  They are great coming of age type of stories for any orientation and very funny.  not just gay literature -- just funny literature.  Not quite as funny as "Running with Scissors," but probably more poignant and identifiable to more of us.  Running with Scissors is hilarious, but seems out of this world. Sedaris as 99% as funny, but much more identifiable to us and seems much more like a family member of ours gone awry in a funny, funny way.  Plus, we all know that if our siblings were to rant about us, we'd be characters in a book like Sedaris' too!  I highly recommend this.  Quick read, and very, very good 
 This book has some of the best information out there about cycle commuting.  If everyone used Forester's techniques and advice, I'm sure cycling accidents and fatalities would decrease.  The fact that cyclists aren't respected is because we let ourselves be intimidated by not only other motorists, but our own misunderstanding of the law.  There was a day when I once hoped for a utopia where cyclists were treated with respect-but this day may never come, and now we must assert our rights as best we can.  Living in American can be trying for cyclists  . . . Although Forester's advice on racing can generally be scanned through (if you are serious about it), his chapter on wheel building is amazingly thorough and has helped me build up dozens of wheels.  It is the best out there for beginning to intermediate wheel builders-certainly better that Jobst Brandt's book.  Highly recommended 
 This is a great book for kids to learn a great deal about life. Every parent should buy this for his or her child. Well worth the asking price 
 This book is incredibly handy. I've been baking for 16 years and still found enough use for it that I decided to buy it. It has all the basic cookie recipes, from chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies to the ones that are not so well-known, such as Rugelach and Hamantaschen. There are several variations of different types of cookies, as well as sections for drop cookies, roll-outs, no-bake cookies, and even bars. There is a final chapter just for glazes and icings. I've not had such a complete collection of cookie recipes before.  Besides all that, though, there are many useful tips throughout. From easier pan greasing to easier icing. The recipe directions are all laid out as simple as possible, too. There are often points in baking something new when the cook might wonder if this is supposed to have a certain consistency or look to it, but these directions even point that out. "The batter will seem very curdled to you. Keep mixing it, though, and it will be smooth." Or, "The batter may feel very dry, but keep pressing it out until it is level." These are little tips that don't sound like a big deal, but can be very helpful and encouraging. This is a good book to buy someone who is new to baking. They will get really good results. The book includes a section on the different pans and tools to bake with that anyone can find useful, as well as a chart for measurements and weight. The recipes and tips are so thorough, though, that it would make a good buy for the seasoned baker as well

 This eye-witness account of US troop atrocities on civilians can no longer be hidden.  Scholars may have had an excuse for ignoring it, but now that excuse is removed by this easily available, beautifully produced university press edition.  The majority of the so-called historians who have attributed the burning of Columbia SC to accident, alcohol, burning cotton, etc., are now shown to be the apologist propagandists for a sanitized American history that they most surely are.  In contrast to the eye-witness account, their work now appears laughable.  How can we take these "historians" seriously in anything else they do?  Truth has a way of getting outside its bottle, and like the genie, it can't be put back.  Congratulations to the editor and press for a job well done.

 Aside from Lou Reed's infamous "Metal Machine Music" I'm not sure what a "contractural obligation" record is, but "Try and Stop Me" is no such a thing. And even if it is, I doubt it affected the music. Here's what I'm hearing:  Kottke's music and playing -- unusually difficult to separate from one another -- have always tended to be remarkably clear, concise and at the same time complex. On this CD I hear many of the same elements, with the new addition of a much higher degree of ABSTRACTION than any of his other work. The harmonic and rhythmic content is being pulled in directions that are frankly atypical of what Kottke is known for, and the resulting music really can't be approached the way a listener might approach other, earlier work. The abstraction is emphasized all the more forcefully by the little snippets of familiar pieces tucked in here and there: those comfortable sets of notes set suddenly in less comfortable surroundings have a profoundly interesting, almost disorienting character, especially on the first few listens.  After so many records over so many years, Kottke still has the important ability to be self-critical about his work and to seek new ways to articulate one of the remarkable talents of our lifetimes. No let down here.. 
 Kids ages 4-8 will find this an inviting story of a squirrel who loves the paintings he sees through the window of an art museum. One day he notices a street artist copying the masterpieces - and he decides to try his own hand at art, with some unexpected results. A CD of the author reading this story is included 
 The art of the last century viewed through the eyes of one of its best critics. This book is lavishly illustrated, very easy to read, an invaluable introduction to modern and contemporary art (that is, until the early 1990's). Hughes is one of those few critics who know how to admit they can sometimes be wrong (see his mea culpa on Philip Guston's late works), but who is almost always right. The book itself is divided into chapters which do not necessarily follow a chronology but rather distinguish different themes such as "the mechanical paradise" (Cézanne,cubism, futurism), "the faces of power" (expressionism, Dada, art under Communism or Fascism), or "the landscape of pleasure" (Monet, Gauguin, Matisse, Louis, Noland), etc...up to "the future that was" with insights on contemporary art and the art market. A book that has already become a classic, almost like Gombrich's "the Story of Art" 
 Prints excellent color pictures with good photo quality that stands out with quality paper. I have been using Canon printers for their individual ink cartridges that are easy to refill. Completely satisfied. Good price on Amazon also. My other two Cannon printers were researched and purchased online, one through AMAZON, also 
 This book is acting in biblical proportions and is a must for all serious actors 
 Ties up the loose end of the Garden Trilogy.  Best to listen to the first two in this series first.  Highly recommend 
 This tome is advertised as a companion piece to the earlier Rutherfurd novel, Sarum, and it is just that.  Whereas Sarum dealt primarily with the more urbanized area in and around Salisbury, The Forest deals with the adjacent rural area encompassed by the King's Forest.  Very similar in style and scope to other Rutherfurd works, it is still my opinion that his best work remains Russka.  Perhaps due to having read roughly half a dozen of Rutherfurd's novels, I'm beginning to appreciate them less and less.  "Familiarity breeds contempt."  I've run into some of the same thing in Clancy and Michener (and more keenly with Cirque du Soliel) where I found that their later works were less satisfying than earlier efforts.  Perhaps this is more an issue pertaining to the reader than the author.    If The Forest were the first Rutherfurd work I ever read, perhaps it would be my favorite, who knows.  In any event, The Forest is an entertaining and reliable read.  It is pure Rutherfurd, and if you enjoyed other works by that author, you will not be disappointed, but will not likely be bowled over.  
 I have been trying to find an inexpensive copy of this CD for quite a while and finally, success.  The purchase was swift, easy, and with Paypal totally painless 
 Alexander McCall Smith's latest series introduces us to characters ranging from the egocentric Bruce whose full time job consists of taking baths and admiring his looks in the mirror to Irene, the neurotic mother who has encouraged her young son, Bertie, to learn Italian and the Saxaphone despite his protests and then there is Pat, the attractive college student on her 2nd Gap Year who recognizes the good in people despite falling in love with Bruce, albeit temporarily.  While I enjoyed all of the story lines and characters, I found the relationship with Pat and Domenica, her elderly neighbor, most interesting given that many young people dismiss the elderly as being boring and unworthy of their time which is so often not the case, as Pat recognized.   Like other reviewers, the only potential downside to this book was the references to Scottish politics and customs that I couldn't relate to not having lived there... at the same time however, that is what makes it interesting because it opened my eyes up to another world which is the whole point of books in my opinion.  
 As a teenager not many of my friends like children's books, but I have and always will have a profound affection for them. "Cherries and Cherry Pits" continues to be a favorite of mine- your minds eye can relish on the fresh, colorful drawings whilst you read of the simple pleasures derived from a yummy little fruit. This book always leaves me with a little dance in my step, an artistic itch in my fingers and a mouth watering for cherrie 
 I read this book many years ago before I went to Israel,and thought then that it should be required reading in the school curriculum.It takes considerable concentration to absorb it all and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around.This time I bought it for my son in law 
 We are now living in John Ruskin's nightmare, an industrialized, sweatshop world of mass-produced, unnecessary goods.  Victorian Ruskin (1819-1900) believed in the need for individual creative expression.  "You must either make a tool of the creature, or a man of him.  You cannot make both.  Men were not intended to work with the accuracy of tools, to be precise and perfect in all their actions. . . On the other hand, if you will make a man of the working creature, you cannot make him a tool.  Let him but begin to imagine, to think, to try to do anything worth doing; and the engine-tuned precision is lost at once.  Out come all his roughness, all his dulness, all his incapability;  shame upon shame, failure upon failure, pause after pause:  but out comes the whole majesty of him also" (pp. 14-15).  Ruskin believed that we should never encourage the manufacture of any article not absolutely necessary.  Anyone who purchases unnecessary goods is "a slave-driver."  We should never demand an exact finish or perfection for its own sake, and we should never encourage imitation or copying of any kind, except for the sake of preserving records of great works (pp. 20-21).   Ruskin was not only an art critic, he was a social visionary who, with brilliant insight, examined nature, architecture, politics, history, and myth in his writing.  This Penguin Great Ideas edition of Ruskin includes extracts from THE STONES OF VENICE (1853) and THE TWO PATHS (1859).  G. Merritt  
 This book is great. Answers a lot of breastfeeding questions. I referred to is often with both of my children born 5 years apart. Im still feeding my 6 month old now and pretty much have things going well - but Im sure I'll be reading the book again when we go through weening. Breastfeeding is really hard work but also very rewarding and worth the effort & time it takes to Master. This book aids the reading in discovering their own breastfeeding skills and ability. I recently purchased another copy of the book for a friend who just had her first baby. Hopeing it helps her like it did me. 
 This is perhaps one of the most enjoyable textbooks I have ever laid my hands and eyes upon. And to think that it is meant to teach you statistics. The authors use an unconvential approach to the subject, but manage very successfully to hit the heart of the matter. In other words, they go beyond formulas and mathematical conceptions and push you to understand the logic behind statistics. What does represent? How should we interpret? What are the possible fallacies? All of this while guided by the simple, entertaining yet thorough language employed. A must have for all that want to be introduced to the strangely wonderful world of statisitcs. Simply read the praises on the back cover to get a sense of the book's power. 
 This book is very useful when counseling adolescents.  It covers a wide range of topics and gives great ideas for helping clients.  
 I bought this book after I bought the Met's dvd of the Ring and fell in love with Norse sagas. Rackham brings that old world feel with all the knarls, worts and all. Wagner's music inspies perhaps the most powerful images of man: lust, power, love, sin and redemption; Rackham's watercolors are faithful to this and help amplfiy the opera 
 Like this anthology, Kathy Acker's postmodern, punk literary project blurs the lines between scholars and rock stars, playwrights and artists, friends and colleagues. At once deeply personal and intellectually rigorous, these eight essays do justice to a woman who died too young and changed the cultural landscape for the better.   May it extend her incomparable, ferocious legacy!  
 Ya conocï¿½a la existencia de este grupo, pero nunca me habï¿½a decidido a comprar un disco suyo, hasta que escuchï¿½ "Is it wicked not to care?". La voz me pareciï¿½ tan dulce y la canciï¿½n tan bonita que solo por esta ya me lo comprï¿½. No me costï¿½ mucho ya que es un grupo que siempre me habï¿½a llamado la atenciï¿½n por sus portadas, pero ahora... me he hecho su fan!! De lo mejor que he conocido ultimamente. 100% recomendado!! 
 It has been some years since I read the book so that is why I am only giving it a four. But it is one of those that stays with you long after many similar genre works are long forgotten so it should get a five. I loved Littel working the plot from the aspect of a CIA staffer who works in cryptography - not your typical Bond type. The cryptologist uses his knowledge of what is going on and hides CIA information to force the Agency to train him to exact revenge on the terrorists who killed his fiance. I also loved the sub plot of "who wrote Shakespeare's work." While Robert Ludlum and Clancy are still my favorites and both turn out excellent reads I would add Littel to my list of those who need to be read. And The Amateur is one of my very favorites 
 Just recently, I have read the Newberry Medal-winning novel Jacob Have I Loved written by Katherine Paterson. This book describes the life of young, Sara Louise Bradshaw, the twin of the popular and more appreciated, Caroline Bradshaw, growing up on the small island of Rass. All her life, Louise felt as if Caroline has deprived her of everything: their family's love, her friends, and her dreams for a successful future. Then, when Captain Wallace - who had mysteriously returned after fifty years of disappearance - finds a way to obtain a scholarship for Caroline in Baltimore, Louise is left to tassel with her sharp-mouthed grandmother and take on the traditional job of a male as a waterman. Unfortunately, this did not satisfy the woman she was becoming. Louise must learn to fight past her jealousy of her sister's shadow and figure and find her way to place Caroling cannot reach. I learned of this book from a friend and found it interesting from their description. After reading, however, I realized it is very emotional and gets very deep into the feelings of jealousy and hatred. In addition, it also has a large use of vocabulary. So I would recommend it to anyone who is thirteen or older preferably to the female gender but some men may also find this story appealing. 	 I liked the characters involved in this story. They definitely helped make up the plot and each one contributed differently. For example, Caroline is blond, pretty, and has a voice like an angel but she is selfish. These characteristics play a large role in Louise's process of understanding herself. Then there is Louise. Plain, brunette, unappreciated, and hard-working, she is the one who struggles in the story. The problems she faces internally and with her sister evolved into the wonderful story of Jacob Have I Loved. This novel uses a first-person narrative. Because of this style, the reader can experience Louise's story with her. Since one of the central themes in this novel is self-discovery, the first person narrative seems almost essential. It allows readers to experience the distinctive viewpoint of the Louise as she encounters different events throughout the life that affect and change her outlook. Such as disputing with her grandmother, meeting the Captain, and going off to school. Although, some parts of the book did remain hard to understand. Such as the fact that Louise falls in love with a 70-year-old man or that people don't seem to make much of the war that is going on when they live on an island in the Chesapeake Bay. This makes this story seem unrealistic to me. However, I do approve of the author's ability to describe things that are occurring in the story. It helps the reader visualize things and follow along with story that is Louise's life somewhat easier. For example, when Paterson wrote, "And from the center of the back row Caroline's voice came suddenly like a single beam of light across the darkness... Then we were all singing, better than we had all night, better than we ever has, suddenly judged, da**ed, and purged in Caroline's light." I was able to imagine what Caroline's voice must have sounded like. I also enjoyed the author's choice of words. Through reading this book, I was able to learn a quite a few new words. Louise's internal conflicts help readers to realize that self-discovery is a huge part of maturing and that giving up will not get you anywhere in life. 	 Overall, I enjoyed reading this story of Sara Louise Bradshaw. Through the story I was able to conclude where the very odd title derived from. The name Jacob Have I Loved comes from the bible in Romans 9:13: "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." So it can be decided that the story of Jacob and Esau, who were also twins, relate to Caroline and Louise. I also found this interesting. Altogether, the book is entertaining and provides a new perspective on life as a whole. Katherine Paterson's way of writing is very creative and justly deserved the Newberry Medal. Anyone who appreciates novels of determination or ones of emotion would deeply love this upholding tale. 
 The "lics" are the most under rated group out on wax. Niggas need to stop sleepin and start peepin.  I agree with the skit on the album "they the tightest niggas on the WEST COAST".  If ya'll out there listinging, keep those liquid lyrics flowin.         Keep it real  this is Low Down from GARDENA, CALIFORNIA!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Man this album was dope as hell when it first came out and is till this day. The album would get five stars for str8 ballin alone. But the album has NUMEROUS hits on it to support str8 ballin and make this a classic album. A must have for pac fans 
 as a semi amateur cook i have found this book to be very inspirational.....not just for recipes, but encouraging creativity. some of the best recipes are the simplest, like corn soup with corn ice. would recommend for anyone interested in cooking creativel 
 This book, part of a collective of what has become to be known as "the London Excavations" is invaluable for academic or hobbyist alike.  Complete in its recording and detailing of dress accessories such as brooches, buttons, buckles, bells, purses,hair accessories, etcetera it provides a complete breakdown of information with excellant quality illustrations.  Provides extensive commentary on materials and methods, uses, and contextural information. This is not just a compilation of data, its an extensive body of work on dress accessories of the period and their use 
 "Suppose truth were a woman..." 	-Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil  All readers undergo a voyage to discover hidden meanings-a voyage which is also a passage of self-discovery.  Like most meta-fictional narratives, Thomas Pynchon's first novel, V. (1963) is intensely preoccupied with the act of reading itself and the possibility of self-reading.  Never has reading seemed so lugubrious.  The plot concerns Stencil, the son of a now-deceased British foreign officer, who, accompanied by eponymous "schlemihl" Benny Profane, half-heartedly searches for the elusive "V."-who may be a woman, a thing, a concept, a sewer rat, or nothing at all.  Stencil is a reader, broadly understood: he attempts to interpret the meaning of an initial.  Reading is here a process without progress and without terminus: Stencil never succeeds in identifying the initial's referent.  As his name implies, Stencil can only trace the outlines of that which he seeks; his search is, to a certain extent, a fruitless yearning for truth.  To put an end to the process of reading would be to lose one's human spontaneity.  For this reason, "V." must never be found.  If "V." were found, Stencil would become indistinguishable from an inanimate object.  The search for "V." is the only thing that he distinguishes him from a thing: "His random movements before the war had given way to a great single movement from inertness to-if not vitality, then at least activity" [55].  Both Profane and Stencil are terrified of the world of objects.  They fear its stasis, its contagious inanimateness.  The inanimate objects that populate Pynchon's narrative often resemble human beings, such as the beer tap that is shaped in the form of a "foam rubber breast" [16].  Human beings, conversely, are themselves often functional and machinelike: eg., Benny Profane's jaunts resemble the idiotic up-and-down movements of a yo-yo; Rachel's words are described as "inanimate-words [Profane] couldn't really talk back at" [27], etc.  All of the "characters" in the novel are threatened by the lifeless world of things.  Stencil needs to search for the inaccessible in order to separate himself from the inanimateness of objecthood, in order to avoid freezing into a thingly state: "He tried not to think, therefore, about any end to the search.  Approach and avoid" [55].  If "V" were found, it would be necessary to lose it again and reinitiate the search.  Readers are implicated in this impossible quest, involuntarily placed in the position of code-breakers.  Like Stencil, they obsessively ask themselves, "Who, then, is V.?"  Because the identity of "V." is never completely given, the solution to the code seems to withdraw abyssally into darkness.  Without an answerable meaning, the "alien hieroglyphic[-]" [17] seems to exist on its own terms.  The book's center, it would seem, is not some intentional content that would lie behind or beyond the code, but, rather, the code itself.  The cipher itself is illuminated, not its meaning.  The point of interpretation is no longer to identify a transcendental meaning or theme, but rather to sift through the fragments and details of the narrative, the ill-fitting pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.  The unanswerable question, "Who, then, is V.?" incites us to return to the forgotten or neglected world of appearances.  Bluntly stated, the disconnected pieces of Pynchon's narrative are what is essential, not the "whole" to which they would belong. Pynchon's novel is an anti-adventure story about the plight of reading.  It challenges us to interpret something-the initial "V."-without thinking in terms of a whole: the particular clues in the story do not relate to the context of the universal.  Any interpretation that thinks in terms of the universal, in this context, is doomed to failure.  V. concerns the failure of reading and self-reading.  Stencil's obsessive yet ultimately grim and joyless quest is to discover his own provenance (the search for "V." is, to a certain extent, the search for his own father, der Vater in German) and therefore to discover his own identity.  And yet there is no definitive conclusion to the process of self-reading; therefore, there is no definite self-understanding.  Stencil's identity is determined by the impossible which he seeks: "[H]e was quite purely He Who Looks for V." [225].  If this process had any finality, he would be nothing at all-that is to say, nothing more than a thing, one thing among others.  The task of reading, then, must remain an infinitely provisional task.  Brenda remarks to Profane in Malta: "`You've had all these fabulous experiences.  I wish mine would show me something.'/`Why.'/`The experience, the experience.  Haven't you learned?'/Profane didn't have to think long. `No,' he said, `offhand I'd say I haven't learned a goddamn thing.'" [454].  Stencil and Profane are led on an issueless quest-as are those of us who follow them.  The absence of anything like a decipherable meaning forces us to think about why we read: the book reveals our desire to discover order in chaos, to impose structure and coherence on entropy, to implement systems where there is none.  According to the metaphorics of V., the search for meaning is more vital than the meaning that is sought.  Such is the significance of the non-questions that populate the book-questions that are unshelled of the interrogative form: "What are you afraid of" [36]; "Do you like it here" [40], etc.  These questions without questions remind us that, when approaching this book, we must pose questions without hankering after results.  The question is its own answer.  Joseph Suglia, the author of YEARS OF RAGE, the novel inspired by the Columbine High Massacr 
 I picked this novel up on a whim long ago during my Trekkie phase, and I was pleasantly surprised by it.  Not only does it bring back the memorable characters of TOS cast in TNG universe, it incorporates them and their motivations in a way that the shows never really did.  The story deals with Spock finally coming under Romulan capture during his lengthy task of reunification.  Held by an ambitious governor, he is scheduled to be executed along with his followers, and thus the stage is set for the political intrigue and philosophical side of the novel.  Starfleet's response is swift and sure.  Spock had an amazing memory, and 150 years of top-level Federation secrets locked within his mind.  The security threat is staggering.  Thus, one of Spock's old friends -- a certain Doctor Leonard McCoy -- is brought aboard the flagship Enterprise to help negotiate the prisoner release before the romulans discover Spock among the unificationists.  At the same time, retired engineer and genius Montgomery Scott intercepts a message from Starfleet to the Enterprise, and decided to go after Spock himself.  To do that, he needs a ship, and so in pure Scotty fashion, steals an ancient constitution class starship in hopes of getting Spock out of Romulan territory himself.  The novel is a joy to read, and so I won't say much more.  I will say, though, that this book really captures the adventure feel of the original series with the amazing characters of the next generation.  In dealing with these relics of the past, the clash of tactics comes to the fore, and in the end it is a mesh of those tactics and philosophies that finally is needed -- but are the stubborn people of both crews and times able to meet that middle ground?    It's an interesting though, and explored fairly well 
 very interesting....finished it in 4 days.  Sometimes all the characters got confusing, but the end is surprising and it's a good rea 
 I rarely give 5 star reviews but this book was truly an enjoyable read that taught me alot. Here are the key lessons:  1). ALWAYS have a stop loss order in place when you buy stocks, about $1.50 to $2.00 under your purchase price, this safeguards you against the huge losses people experience in a bear market. 2). Watch unexpected volume surges in stocks that push the price up, this is a sign that other investors know something that you do not.You can partner with insiders and people in the know with out knowing what is really driving the price. 3). Never sell a stock that is rising in price.Only sell on declines. 4). Watch price boxes that develop in stocks, if a stock is trading at $66 to $70 for 6 months then suddenly goes to $72 it is likely the sign of a new price range box, buy at break outs. 5). Take emotion out of tading set your rules and follow them. 6). Stay away from the rumors and mob mentality of Wall Street, get your information from Barron's weekly and daily quotes, everything else just leads to confusion. 7). Watch stock prices and go with the patterns you watch develop. 8). Look for the break away stocks that will make you rich, trade the stocks that are at their 52 week high if they are growth stocks and if they appear to be breaking new highs.  Darvas has an entertaining writing style and gets to the point. 5 strong stars, this is great information to tie in with what can be learned from Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher, William O'Neal and Jim Cramer. 
 When Science Meets Religion: Enemies, Strangers, or Partners?, involves what Holmes Rolston, III, fittingly describes as a distillation of "a lifetime of thinking about how science and religion relate."  As dean of and senior statesman for the science and religion discussion, Barbour draws together, in a user-friendly way, a variety of critical issues in that conversation.  The book is "intended as an introduction to the field," says the author, and the book is "briefer and more accessible than my early writings."  That Barbour is capable of pulling off a project of this magnitude will come as no surprise to those acquainted with his work.  Barbour, the Winifred and Atherton Bean Professor Emeritus of Science, Technology and Society at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, launched the current era in the dialogue between science and religion thirty-five years ago with his groundbreaking book, Issues in Science and Religion.    Since the release of that publication, Barbour's works have become standard texts for those both inside and outside the interdisciplinary science and religion discussion.  In 1999, this physicist and theologian won the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.  What makes When Science Meets Religion different from Barbour's previous books is the innovative method he uses to explore the pertinent material, most of which has been addressed in earlier writing.  In the book's opening chapter, Barbour explains varying way that science and religion are considered to be related using his now classic four-fold typology (conflict, independence, dialogue, and integration).  He then applies this typology in subsequent chapters to discuss (1) astronomy and creation, (2) quantum physics, (3) evolution and continuing creation, (4) genetics, neuroscience, and human nature, and (5) God's action in nature.  While the majority of the book's space is devoted to summaries and explanations, Barbour's novel use of his typology results in a book more apologetic in tone than books he has previously authored.  In particular, Barbour gives reasons for disagreeing with the "conflict" thesis type, and, although pointing out valid themes in the independence type, he also does not accept the "independence" conclusions.  The proposals he does appreciate fit appropriately in the "dialogue" and "integrationist" types. Barbour believes, then, that the preferred answer to the book's subtitle "Enemies, Strangers, or Partners?" is that science and religion are best understood as capable of a mutually enriching partnership.  Barbour calls his own theory for how science and religion best "meet" a "theology of nature."  "Proponents of a theology of nature," he explains, "draw extensively from a historic tradition and a worshipping community, but they are willing to modify some traditional assertions in response to the findings of science."  He cautiously uses notions from process philosophy, among other integrationist theories, to construct this theology of nature hypothesis.  The chapter summaries provide readers with glimpses into Barbour's personal conclusions on matters central to the science and religion discussion.  With regard to astronomy and creation, Barbour notes that, "at the moment, a singular Big Bang seems  the most plausible theory, and the theist can see it as a moment of divine initiation."  However, he cautions, "we should not tie our religious beliefs irrevocably to one theory."   In summarizing his discussion of genetics, neuroscience, and human nature, Barbour contends that "both recent theology and recent science support a view of the person as a multilevel psychosomatic unity who is at the same time a biological organism and a responsible self."  That both religious and scientific theories are able to support such a view provides grounding for further work in these general areas.  In the final chapter, in which conceptions pertaining to God's relation and activity in nature are addressed, Barbour returns, at least implicitly, to issues explored in previous chapters.    John B. Cobb, Jr., in his citation nominating Barbour for the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion that Barbour subsequently won, said that "no contemporary has made a more original, deep and lasting contribution toward the needed integration of scientific and religious knowledge and values than Ian G. Barbour.  With respect to the breadth of topics and fields brought into this integration, Barbour has no equal."  Barbour's latest contribution, When Science Meets Religion: Enemies, Strangers, or Partners?, provides further confirmation for Cobb's true statement.  Thomas Jay Oor 
 Barbara Vine (a.k.a. Ruth Rendell) is back with yet another fascinating psychological portrait of what could be called the ultimate dysfunctional family. A young Swedish caretaker (Kersten,  pronounced "Shastin") is sent to work for the Cosway family, four unmarried daughters and a disturbed son who are ruled by the apathetic 80 year old Ida Cosway. They live in a rambling ivy covered mansion which features a mysterious maze inside a locked library. Kersten soon finds that the family members pretty much hate each other and their lives are governed by sexual jealousies, secrets and lies. Fascinating and compulsively readable, this is the author at her best. Vine knows how to provide just enough minimal information to hook the reader and a wry sense of humor pervades. For mystery and suspense fans who want more than just a whodunnit. Excellent 
 This is a wonderful book.  I have been using it for years in special education and preschool settings.  Children always respond to the excellent illustrations and simple text.  The pages easily correspond with the text making it a very satisfying counting and retelling experience 
 Gene Yang manages to really flesh out major issues in racial self-discovery for Asian-Americans, especially male Asian-Americans.  The book is concise- I read it in less than 1.5 hours.  It shamelessly brings out thorny issues with relieving humor.  I am Asian American and I concur with many of the issues brought up.  Many of the references from the group play with transformers to the projection of superiority onto fobber Asians tap into my history of wrestling with identification.  The clean presentation and comic book format would be appealing to a younger audience, especially one that isn't receptive to reading longer books or listening to grown-ups.  
 I love that it has two different modes- you can shuffle your playlist or just listen to it in the order you put the play list in on your computer. I also like the fact that you don't have to fuss with batteries, and the charge lasts a really long time. It's very compact, and the clip holds well. It doesn't take as long to synch with my computer as I thought it would, and it doesn't take very long to charge (a couple hours) especially compared to how long the charge lasts (my sister-in-law has been using hers at least an hour every day for over a month and still hasn't had to recharge it). This product gets two thumbs up from me. The ONLY downside is you may want to consider the iPod Nano instead if you want more than 250 songs on there 
 This CD is like a postcard from Miami... It reminds me the morning at the Space patio. I went to Gryphon only once since it is around 25 miles away from Miami. Their sound system is one of the best and I can hear Ivano playing all these tracks until 7 or 8 in the morning 
 i haven't learned math for several years and this is a good book for me to recall them and also give me new knowledge relate to chemistry. 
 McCartney is a mystery but not this great book. I liked it a lot as I do all of Giuliano's works 
 A lot has already been said about this novel, so I'll address my review to those unfamiliar with Mccarthy's work.  If you've never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start.  The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous.  If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling "Blood Meridian."    Some people will take issue with Mccarthy's grammar, sentence structure, use of Spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof).  Mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning.  The sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and "breath," meaning that they don't always look or sound like conventional prose.  This will be displeasing to some.  As an example, the first line of the book reads:  "The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door."  Now, Mccarthy could have just as easily said "the candle flickered when he entered the room," or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same.  Read the first page of the book.  If you don't catch fire at the beauty of it, then maybe this book, and Mccarthy's work in general, is not for you 
 I have long been a fan of Mr. Doherty's work. His latest collaboration does not disappoint. Justin never seizes to amaze. Nine out of 10 dentists agree, "Tales from the Wisconsin Badgers" is a must-read 
 Ok, ok, ok. If you think like I was, shure you think "ok, this book is another one that think is the best in the field". I was thinking like this until I received and read the book! It is fantastic in all aspects about sales. Conclusion: if you have any doubts about SALES, THIS IS THE BOOK!! 
 I only picked up Bow Down a few months ago and at the time I wasn't expecting that much from it, but I ended up being surprised at how good Westside Connection's debut effort was.  I already owned most of Ice Cube's other work and I believed (like most others) that he hadn't really done anything significant since Lethal Injection.  However in 1996 at the height of the tension between the East & West, Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC dropped this gem of an album.  On this site and on some other sources I have seen some fairly negative reviews of this album and they are unfair in my opinion.  I suspect most of the bad press towards this album was from East Coast critics, the very people this album was targeting, and i'm not surprised they didn't like it, about half the tracks on the album are disses or have references to the East Coast.  Whether the East Coast will admit it or not though, there was a lack of respect given to the West, and this album legitimately adressed that.  The album itself has several great tracks, Bow Down, All The Critics In New York, Do You Like Criminals?, The Gangsta The Killa and The Dope Dealer and the Cypress Hill diss, King of The Hill (which WC refused to take part in) among the best.  The beats are seriously heavy and sound like a post G-funk era of music, there is not a bad beat on the album, and though it only has 10 tracks there is really nothing you could call filler on here.  As for the emcees themselves, Ice Cube is definetely a cut above, and despite what some say, he was still clearly relevant in 1996.  I hadn't heard much of Dub C before listening to this album, but his flow is great though he can't match Cube's lyrical intensity, and though I haven't always been a great fan of Mack 10, he does a good job on this album.  Overall a great album, may have angered New York but the West Coast had good cause to be upset with their treatment from the East, and this album made that point, when some others were trying to diffuse the situation.  4.5 stars, only misses out on a 5 because a few of the songs are only O.K (though not bad), I also would have liked to see Westside Slaughterhouse on here, as I don't own Mack 10's debut album and it was their first song together, otherwise highly recommended 
 I can say from personal experience that this book is priceless if you have a vindictive ex that uses the children to hurt you during and after a divorce. What your ex does not understand is the substantial damage it will do to the children long-term. To save your relationship with your children and to combat Parental Alienation the only book that actively helps you with point by point examples is this book. Not only have I bought "Divorce Poison", but my children's grandparents have as well. In "Divorce Poison", Dr. Warshak provides many different means by which a vindictive ex will attempt to alienate your children from you. What makes this book so valuable is that Dr. Warshak takes each alienation example and then gives you a TAKE ACTION assignment on how to best combat the attempts by your ex. There are numerous TAKE ACTION sections throughout the book and I must say that his advice truly does work. If your ex is poisoning your children and your relationship with them, this book will help you actively keep control of the situation and maintain a meaningful and loving relationship with those caught in the middle. An interesting point that Dr. Warshak presents is that oftentimes an ex that alienates their children against the other spouse, is the product of a mother or father that also actively attempted to alienate their children. Sad how history repeats itself. By purchasing this book you will help your children, your relationship with them, and you will learn the seven most common errors made by rejected parents.

 So, I decided to take control of my finances again and a friend recommended that I read "The Richest Man in Babylon", which I did.  Right after I finished that book, I read through Suze's "9 Steps to Financial Freedom".  I took notes.  I dog-eared pages.  I used PostIt's.  I turned my financial situation around almost overnight.  Sounds like hype, but it's not.  Where Babylon gave me the common sense to pay attention to what I spent, what I saved, and the importance of budgeting, Suze filled in the gaps with practical advice on just how to do that.  Consider this work by Suze as the missing manual on how to keep your money and make it work for you.  Thanks Suze 
 My graduate class raced through this text, successfully I guess.  As a GIS researcher, I found that the concerns surrounding the interface of GIS and human geography were handled in a biased way.  In this I mean that the one chapter that deals with the techniques of human geography did a marginal job discussing GIS as just another in a line of positivist technical skills, rather than a true path for research.  The text is dry, as only British Academics can manage, but is very comprehensive.  My Berkley-trained prof like the book, if that helps at all. 
 This movie does a good job of portraying how much impact our view of life has on our happiness, and of those around us.  
 This book is with out a dout the 2nd best book I have ever read!  No offense to the author, but I loved The Diary Of A Killer Cat by Anne Frank.  I think this book was not only for teachers, adults, counslers.  I think  this book would be most entertaining to students like me.  I am a student  and I read this book every night before I go to bed.  I'd give this book 6  STARS!! 
 My friends and I were at Legends (a strip club in London, Ontario) when they were filming the dancers last summer. I didn't get interviewed like the previous reviewer did, but it was still a pretty wild night. The club was really packed that night and there were plenty of cute dancers. My favourite is Southern Heat, a really cute latino guy. Since none of these dancers were from London, I was hoping to get a copy this documentary from TV, but now that it's comming out on DVD I just buy that. I wonder what they put into the deleted scenes section 
 Perhaps its birdsong which is the attraction: if so, pick up Donald Kroodsma's The Singing Life Of Birds: The Art And Science Of Listening To Birdsong. Learn about how birds acquire their songs, how they vary between species and places, and how to identify birds through song. First-person observation and reporting accompanies scientific facts and research. Professor Kroodsma has studied birds and their songs for over thirty years; but his The Singing Life Of Birds is that perfect cross between research and casual observation which makes it engrossing to a wider audience than college-level students of ornithology. 
 I haven't used it thoroughly yet. But from what I have seen so far, it is a pretty good scale to track your everyday fat loss progress. I am satisfied with this purchase for the price and quality and ease of use. I use it daily to track my body fat % and weight. So far used it for only myself. Haven't checked it out for more than 1 users 
 This story touched my heart. It was so sad in the ending when Claudia gave a little book to Stacey that had gossip,jokes,ect. Definetly read this 
  Personally I just fipped through most of the "current" story the story set in the present.  I found this to be generic and not very compelling.    I found the alternate track dealing with the "forest people" to be fascinating.  It shows the development of one guy into a real leader of his people and the idea of the histories isn't too bad either.    Also I respect Dekker for brining us a book that is not released over a long period of time by releasing all the books over a 5 month period he is helping out those of us who don't read unfinished series'.  I learned my lesson reading Song of Ice and Fire.  So thank you Mr. Dekker keep them comming.    
  The Rainmaker is an intriguing story that will keep readers wanting to turn the page.  Written by John Grisham, this story has inspired readers everywhere.  It's a story of compassion, devotion, and love- This is the story of a lawyers struggle through the beginning of his career. 	The Rainmaker is about a rooky lawyer named Rudy Baylor who just graduated from law school.  He has passed his bar exam and has taken on his first cases as a lawyer.  Since Rudy has no money and no place to live, he's just looking for some easy money makers.  At least that's what he thinks these cases are, but Rudy gets in over his head.  These so called easy cases turn into a fight for justice in this small town. 	With the help of his new found partner, a friend who knows the ropes of law, and some ways around it, Rudy finds the real lawyer inside of him, vs. the lawyer that breezed through college.  He fights for what's right against a dishonest insurance company that won't cover a young man with leukemia and a young woman with an abusive husband. 	This story follows his struggles, hardships and breakthroughs.  This is an extraordinary story.  It's a story for all readers and one that everyone will enjoy.  This novel is written so well you feel like you're not just reading it, but your there, in the courtroom, or in the office, or wherever the story may take you.  The details, it's not superficial or unrealistic, and how the characters are written make the story even more real.  It almost feels like a biography, like Rudy's thoughts were written down on paper as he thought them.  Reading this story will inspire young lawyers, and young readers everywhere.  I can truly say that this novel is one that I can read over and over and still be taken aback by this story of affection, love, and allegiance. 
 The handle on this knife is particularly comfortable. Out of the many knives I've tried this is one of the most comfortable. 
 I have spent a lifetime of working on roulette systems in my spare time. It is an interesting hobby. I was thrilled many times to think I had a winning system and for several days I had visions of sugar plums. I purchased just about every possible gambling system and i was very disappointed. Now I find this little cheap book has opened my eyes.  I am just smart enough to recognize the value. I thought I was putting things together but now I see that I wasn't even on first base. For every serious gambler this book is worth many times the cost. I thought there was a lack of plays until I  re read the part about using the little signs ( they give the last seventeen spins) and playing many tables at once. To think I have spent over a thousand dollars for systems and this book under twenty dollars provides the real paths to success ---makes me sick. Wish I had read it many years ago. Buy the book if you never use it. The general ideas are worth a fortune. T.T.Thoma 
 His prose is excellent, but his poetry (the black riders / war is kind) is what stays with me.  The striking images, dark humor and subversive fight against authority bring me back to the book decade after decade.  These aren't Shakespearean sonnets; if he was born a hundred years later he would be channeling his raw feelings into writing lyrics for Rage Against the Machine.  His poetry seems so modern it is hard to reconcile it with the completely different feel of The Red Badge of Courage and his splendid Spanish American War reporting 
 This is a fine album.  It's Hank I channeled through Bill Haley and Bob Wills.  It's a nice assortment of rockabilly swing interspersed with some nifty, jazzy ballads, the highlight of which is "Highway Bound."  Perhaps the songs on average aren't quite up to Williams' standards.  On the other hand, these musicians have chops the Comets never dreamed of 
 A colleague of mine invited me to try Beverly Jenkins. I am so glad I did. This book was excellent. I enjoyed this book so much that I ordered five other titles. As an avid reader, I am always on the look out for a great read.I highly recommend Beverly Jenkins books 
 I love it! It is exactly what I had in mind.  There is the silicone skin complete cover with a plastic shell on the front.  The shell covers the display and there is a cut out for the click wheel that is covered by the silicone skin.  The system comes with three silicone skins ("clear", black, and glow in the dark)and one shell.  there is the option of a belt clip (I don't use)that works well too. The bottom is open for both connections.  The hold button on top is a little tough to get if your finger nails are very short however.  There is an adapter as well for the iPod dock.  For me this is the perfect case 
 This tragic story is very personal, as told by a young girl, Lenny Sethi (possibly autobiographical?) living in the Punjab region of northwest India during the few years prior to and after the partition of India.  History is full of such terrible stories and horrible truths, but Cracking India has a very familial impact, and completely feminine perspective.  We are allowed to become part of the extended family that comprises Lenny's young life.  There is a comfortable mix of Sikhs, Muslims, Hindus, Parsees, and Christians prior to the partition, and Bapsi Sidhwa immerses us completely in that unique and unusual world.  What a fragile, terrible facade it turned out to be.    Sidhwa does not try to inform us why people are so often so terrible to each other.  Is she suggesting that no such understanding is possible?  She shows that people live through, but often not beyond, such events.  Cracking India is very compelling and unique, completely engaging, and excruciatingly real.  I found this story to be completely believable, as the story of a young girl told through her adult perspectives.  A completely different world was mine for a brief time in reading Cracking India, and for all its terrors, I am glad I was there.  Highest recommendation 
 This book has had a huge impact on my life-- so much so, that I have purchased 30 copies for friends and family.  Anyone seeking to learn about  the spiritual depth of Judaism will find this book hard to put down!  If  you, like me, have had a hard time finding meaning in Reform or  Conservative Judaism, and seek a greater understanding of "What does  it mean to be Jewish", then you will get a tremendous amount from this  book 
 Interesting series of papers on topics of ongoing discussion regarding global warming. The title is a bit overblown, but I guess it matches the assumption, so often printed over and over in the media, that there is a consensus on global warming (or more correctly, human-caused global warming). There's lots of citations given and places to dig into this as deep as you want. I particularly like the part about trying to develop some sort of heat balance between the earth's surface, the various layers in the atmosphere, and the universe to which the earth radiates heat, and all the unexplained measurement error and missing information associated with that.  There was allusion to the plans to try to "Command and Control" the world's economy, based on averting global warming, basically concluding that nothing we can do will change the outcome much anyway, at least in any predictable way. It makes one wonder if the global warming phenomena is being used as a pretext to try "Command and Control" again. This book does not really get into that, but does give a taste of endless unresolved topics associated with global warming 
 Balfour's book is very good at charting the political waters through which Castro had to navigate.  He understands the complex nature of the pre- and post- revolutionary political structure in Cuba, and the way Cuban history has been determinined (to some degree) by American and Russian policies.  If this is what you're after, this book is for you.  If you want to understand the psychology of Castro, or elements of his private life ("what makes Fidel tick?"), there are glimpses here and there, but that's not the kind of book this is 
 This is an excellent history book on chairmaking and other crafts in England. 
 Jackson is certainly underrated.  This book should be read after Man With an Ax because they are so tied toether and more fun for the reader.  I think Jackson ranks up near the top with George Pelacanos.  His writing and characters stay fresh and interesting.  I've been reading this author since his first book and my sense is that he is still having fun doing this.  Some comments refer to the fact that there is less Mulheisen than expected...but this is what makes Jackson fresh...some new riffs on old characters 
 This group is amazing.  This is the best dancehall album out there, maybe with the exception of Dutty Rock.  These guys flow with the best, and add catchy, modern Jamaica lyrics and CRAZY beats, and you have a 5-star endeavor.  Regardless of where she is what she's doing, my wife can't help but shake it.  More T.O.K 
 I think this is probably the show's best work.  So many classic episodes.  The actors were definitely comfortable with each other by now, but they were still fresh.  I tend to think people who buy TV series on DVD start at season one and buy each one, so don't stop at three.  If you don't buy in order (which isn't really necessary for Seinfeld because it has no plot), season four might be a good place to start.  
 One of the best... Completely whacky & Wodehousian. Jane Opal is one of my favorite PGW girls 
 This is the best song on this album. It has a great story line 
 This is a truly amazing album.  Collin Raye is extremely talented and has produced great work in the past, but this is definitely his best work.  From the optimistic start, with "Anyone Else" to the emotion  filled tear jerker ending, "The Eleventh Commandment" this album  is filled with fantastic music, that transcends the country/pop barriers  that are so easy to find in music today.  I adore this album and could  listen to it over and over again.  As far as the best songs on this album  go, my picks are two unreleased gems, "All My Roads" and  "Survivors."  Talented artist, excellent writing, terrific music,  all in all, a wonderful musical journey 
 The authors present the pageant of blunders that is the Iraq War. This is a disheartening account of the decisions and events that has led us to where we are today. Whether you supported the initial decision to invade or not, the questions before all of us today, are what do we do now, and what must be done to resolve the Iraq dilemma. To address these decisions we must have some understanding of what happened. Mr. Gordon and General Trainor have compiled a detailed and rigorous account of the miscalculations, misconceptions, misjudgments, misunderstandings and misstatements by both civilian and military leaders. Though the authors have gone to extraordinary lengths to be dispassionate and unbiased, they have named names and shown no favoritism in recounting disastrous decisions and their resultant consequences. Their account will fill you with sadness and rage. Perhaps that is where we need to begin to extricate ourselves from this nightmare. I highly recommend this book.  
 Mr. Hobbs (Jimmy Stewart) plans a quiet enjoyable beachside holiday for his family.  He anticipates being able to read War and Peace during his afternoons in the sun.  But what he gets is .... a house that looks like it could belong to the Addams family, rebellious children (a son wedded to the TV and a daughter convinced she is the ultimate wallflower), a housekeeper who does not speak any English, a party line occupied by an endless conversation dealing with medical problems ("Her gall bladder was AS BIG AS a WATERMELON!"), a daughter going through marital difficulties, a son-in-law out of work, a strange water pump, a very sexy neighbor and the guests from hell (John McGiver and Joan).  All this, combined with Stewart's droll third-person narration ("Mr. Hobbs gravely surveyed the scene."), make a great view of the American vacation.    Everyone has had vacations so bad that they become the lifeblood of all future family storytimes - and the times that you remember with the greatest fondness.  This vacation is that for the Hobbs family.  Each member receives some unexpected gift from the vacation, and Stewart comes to a truce with the plumbing and destroys his post-vacation dictated memo detailing the disasters.  One of the highlights of the film is the bird-watching sequence with McGiver and Stewart.  McGiver adopts a perculiar walk that he forces on Stewart's much-taller frame.  So you have Stewart doing a deep-knee bend walk and identifying barn swallows over and over again.  Right up there with Basil Fawlty's goose step 
 I'll admit I was a little skeptical about this game. As it turns out, this game rocks! Arena Football fans do not pass this one up! Hopefully when  they make the sequel(yeah, I said SEQUEL)they will include the new AFL2  teams. Tennessee Valley Vipers rule 
 Could not get Kingston Trio CD's in New Zealand so carried out a review at Amazon. Was extremely happy with the result and the Purchase of The Greatest Hits C 
 A SELECTION OF ENJOYABLE MUSIC. THE DRAMATICS IS DOING WHAT   THEY DO BEST SWEET HARMONY IN MOTION.A JOB WELL DONE 
 Isolation was one of the final pieces I added to my Toto collection. At first listen I wasn't sold. But recently I re-listened and discovered that it is one of my favourites.  This is a fast paced collection of songs, with only "How Does It Feel" as a worthy ballad to slow things down.   There seems to be a real mesh between the keyboards and guitars on this album that I love. Paich absolutely roars through some keyboard solos that made my jaw drop.   "Angle Don't Cry" is the best cut on this album, but from top to bottom it is extremely strong. A real "must have" for the Toto fan.  While "Tambu" remains my favorite Toto album, Isolation continues to impress me.   This one is money well spent 
 Koopsta is the greatest rapper of all time. His mystic style is off the hook!! This cd does not have the greatest beats, they sound like hes rapping to a keyborad. But there are some tracks were he gets insane with his rhymes. Hardcore Koopsta fans will like 13 @ 16, great buy if your a Fan of Koop, i give it 4 stars 
 Deathrow classis: Chronic Doggystle Dogg Food  Simple as that 
 As a teacher, child psychology graduate and mother I have to say that this book was very useful.  Even having studied most of the material in this book in university, it was a excellent reminder of the many ways to stimulate a child's mind.  Yes there are not many gmaes - and the ones included are simple and sometimes obvious.  However the connection the book makes between the games, that most parents play with their babies anyway, and how those games stimulate the mind is fascinating and is what this book is really trying to do.  Once you understand the function of a particular game you can adapt and modify and make new games that stimulate the same parts of the brain.    If you are looking for a strictly games book with less psychology and more actual games and songs, definitely buy Baby Play by Gymboree.  It has games organized by age and then color coded on each page to highlight the game, song, skill, related research etc and you can easily find just what you want without reading all the extra stuff.  Plus, there are fantastic pictures!  But I digress.  Baby Minds is a book with a lot of information.  It is designed, I believe, for the parent or teacher who wants to understand what their child is learning when they play.  Can you successfully raise your child without reading this book?  Absolutely!  Will this book make you more aware of the types of activities you do with your child and what your child is gaining?  Absolutely! 
 This is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject.  The clips of Ginsberg & Burroughs are especially effective.  The celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself & not just empty theatrics. The Beats are still a source to return to for inspiration & insight.  The world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now.  Of course there's more, but this video gives you enough to get you started & gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late 
 If you don't like Rippingtons you surely won't like this album and that's ok of course but eventually you don't like any album from Russ Freeman. When you say "I don't like Russ Freeman music" that's it, you don't have to specify that you didn't like Life in the Tropics. But if you're into Russ's music I think that you have to like this one because it is one of the best Ripp's albums to date. It's one of the best example of the Russ Freeman way of composing and presenting music. Sure it is commercial music, nothing really serious, like all light jazz music is by the way. With this album Russ simply want to give you enjoyment and create a nice relaxed atmosphere with good quality music. The good thing is that Russ always succeed in this attempt and in this case too! Life in the tropics is very balanced as some of the best ripp's albums like Sahara or Black Diamond. It has nice instrumentals, a couple of very good vocal tracks, some more calm moments and some more energetic ones. It is balanced and very well written, arranged, played and recorded as any other ripp's album by the way. It is a very  very good album in it's genre. If you don't like the genre that's another story of course and it's perfectly ok. But my advice is. Take the best from each genre. You don't have to lock yourself inside one single genre. Why limitate ourselves? Music, when it's very well written and played it is always good. No matter the genre. Even in the case of a less noble genre like light jazz. But the music should be good. This is the case. 
 A complete coverage of the legal world of Civil Procedure, in an easy to read and understand format. This book is a must for anyone involved in a Civil Action, attourney or client. Civil Procedure covers all aspects of a  civil action including venue, the complaint, answer, motions, discovery,  trial and appeals. With case referances & index both by subject and  civil Procedure referance code numbers. An excellent referance 
 Well, I bought the book, because I am named after the book. But in reading it I was shocked that a book from 1949, could be such a current day romance novel. I was shocked that a book written at that time contained floozys. The book was well written and I am sure it will always be a classic novel. If you love romance novels, this book is the perfect book for you 
 This book is filled with practical advice for practically every occasion.  I bought The Etiquette Advantage years ago, and it helped me tremendously.  Now, I work in Career Counseling and have passed along the information to many grateful people 
 Some Girls is my absolute favorite original Stones release.  40 Licks is a great compilation, but Some Girls hits the highlights.  Never seem them perform "Girl with Faraway Eyes" in concert though - wouldn't THAT be a treat?  This was the soundtrack to some of the fondest memories of my youth 
 I have seen the movies and I like this book because I learned the legend of Omashu, that wasn't included in the movies. Each of the "Scroll" books have 3 different legends. This book is not a cartoon book, it is more of a chapter book. There are lots of pictures, some not from the movie. If you really want to know more about Avatar I recommend this book 
 Visions in Death is an amazing novel about the relationship between Eve and Roarke This novel is a gripping read from beginning to end. These two writers are awesome and I must add that I have never been disappointed reading their close to 20 books. If you are a fan of the "In Death" series, then you certainly will enjoy this book as you have enjoyed the others. The characters were just amazing, especially in their relationships with one another over the stories.  In this book, there is a serial killer on the loose, and on her tracks is Eve who despite the hectic nature of the job, works herself to exhaustion, and nevertheless starts a new phase in her life by opening up to her friends about the abuses she underwent in her horrible childhood days. The mystery was good, Robb adds a psychic to the mix for something new. There end was sweet, especially the great twist at the end which was difficult for anyone to see coming. With wonderful characters, a superb setting and fast pace, this story stands as a classic.Triple Agent Double  , Origin of Death are thrillers  I also enjoyed. Still I enjoyed this book 
 I find it amusing how many people always find reasons to write off some of the biggest DJs in the world.  I'm not saying they automatically deserve 5-stars because of previous success.  I'm just wondering why people are not more open-minded.  I've been listening to trance for just about 5 years now.  And ATB was never one of the DJs that I ever got into.  Not that there is anything wrong with him, it's just that there is so much out there and I find it hard to keep up with some times.  That being said, I think ATB is an amazing DJ.  He definitely has his own style and I think that's to be admired.  When I first started listening to his music I didn't know what to expect.  But I knew there was a reason that he's the #11 DJ in the world.  And that's because he is simply excellent when it comes to music.  Not only with DJing but with production as well.  I think people often hear the music but don't really listen to it.  And because of this they become so heavily critical of an album and end up missing the entire thing.  Yes, it's true when they say "Trance is like a journey for you mind."  But it comes from the heart, therefore, you should listen with your heart as well.  ~~~P.L.U.R.~~ 
 Ingrid Bergman as Gladys Aylward knew where she had to be. She wanted to perform missionary work and she knew she could when no organized institution believed she could. From England, off to China she went. She makes a difference and eventually has to help the Chinese children from the unspeakable perils from hoards of the brutally invading Japanese. Curt Jurgens is very impressive and charming as the Chinese officer but somehow Robert Donat seems terribly miscast as a Chinese elder. The cinematography is breathtaking and the directional 2 channel stereo is fantastic sounding. This is a good family film. 
 I think crescent is one of John Coltrane's five best albums. It's one of his first albums I got and I have always loved it. It was recorded in 1964 right before A love supreme and in my opinion it is as good. The best songs are Crescent and Lonnie's Lament. The songs are pretty long the longest being 11:45. If you don't have this album make shure it's the next album you get 
 I have not only seen his presentation where I was sitting only two feet away from him, but I have met and chatted with Mr. Andrews for a short period of time, and this man and this presentation is simply wonderful. Everyone will benefit from his lessons, from the way he explains them, and from the mindset and perspective he gives. An amazing story teller, entertaining to the max - you will laugh out loud, and then you will cry, and then again, you will get better. Thank You Andy for being who you are. 
 A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him.  It's a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as "Maximum Bob" and "Stick" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick). I thought this was his best since "Striptease." The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.  Incidentally, isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no?  
 Kevin Spacey. I'll write it again. Kevin Spacey. Whether he's playing Keiser Soze, a pyschopath in Seven, or an alien in K-PAX, any film he touches seems to sizzle. Swimming With Sharks is no exception; in fact, we get to see Kevin in a role that resembles the one he portrayed in Glengary Glen Ross, only magnified thirty of forty levels on the pompousity chart.   Frank Whaley plays his underling in the corporate world. You might remember him as the victim of Samuel L. Jacksons rant in Pulp Fiction right before he gets his head blown off or as the young kid from Field of Dreams - playing a young Burt Lancaster. Well, as goofy as it might sound, Whaley does a WONDERFUL job in Swimming With Sharks. You emphathize with his character, even when he turns from naive victim to unflinching nut-case at the end.   As for premise, Kevin Spacey plays a corporate boss who is showing his yes man, played by Whaley, the tricks to moving ahead. In the mean time, however, he does everything he can to make his employee's life a living hell, thus driving the young worker into......  The last segment of this film is the most amazing. I loved the twist. Many, I imagine, will not. The film quickly moves from humor to dark drama in a matter of minutes, and the twist may upset many, especially Spacey's delivery in the last clutch scenes.   This movie is basically the director's rant and rave come to full life. It's based on his own experience in the corporate world and be warned, untold buckets of foul language await you, so be ready.   
 After a long while of chewing on Crow's hundreds of proper names and knot of labyrinthine politics, I can now reflect upon the text with 20/20 hindsight and testify to its utility.  Though I certainly didn't find it an easy read, or even a particularly enthralling one, Crow did lay the foundation now supporting my knowledge of French painting.  The professor I had who required this book (and whose own book is a marvel: see Grigsby's _Extremities_) told us to forget about the names and focus on the general motions.  That is sound advice for any bravehearted soul reading this book.  All in all, Crow only rarely waxes pompous, vague, or self-contradictory (his analysis of a Rubens-Watteau parallel seems a bit heavy even for him).  This text is dense and shoots to a high level of reader: I commend Crow for having with any success managed to navigate his way through sentences of such length and complexity.  Not for the faint of heart, but a vital groundbreaker for the student of French revolution, politics, and painting 
 I couldn't say enough good things about this book and the series.  
 This is not a book, as the author states, for someone new to photoshop.  That being said it is one of only two photoshop books in my library, and I am very glad that its there.    I've used photoshop for years, but never really delved into the subject of channels.  I thought I was getting along just fine, until I picked up this book in an effort to learn a little something about I knew little of.  Having read this book I realize how much it has opened my eyes to the possibilities of photoshop.    Photoshop's power lies in how it handels selections.  Being able to cut images out of backgrounds, and applying filters to only selected parts of an image are very powerful tools that photoshop gives us. Channels I have found out, are one of the most powerful tools in the selection process.  There are plugins sold for photoshop such as corel's knockout which help you in making complex mask selections, but as I have found out by reading this book, those expensive tools are not necessary most of the time if you know how to make selections using color channels.    Because color channels are such an effective tool to create complex selections, the book also covers related topics, such as  quick masks, layer masks, blend modes, and layer adjustments, which are tools all photoshop artists need to know inside and out.     I found the layout of the book very simple to follow.  There are a few other reviewers who complain about the lack of depth within each chapter.  I found the brief examples refreshing.  I would rather spend half an hour reading and two hours playing around in photoshop practicing my skills, than two hours reading and only half and hour practicing my skills.  I found myself reading a chapter every night and then getting into photoshop to try out the new tricks I learned.  This in not a book which is bogged down in explanations, and I looked forward to reading the next chapter each night.  I feel anyone who is tight on time, but thirsty for knowledge on channels will also find the brevity rewarding.    I also enjoyed Scott Kelby's emphasis on teaching his lessons with keyboard shortcuts and a non-destructive workflow.  Learning that way will only save you time and improve your productivity.  If you already know the basics, and want to take your knowledge of photoshop to the next level.  If you don't have the money to spend on expensive classes, or the time to read an encyclopedia.  Then I highly reccomend this book.  
 This book was an easy read and highly entertaining.  Unfortunately there is no credibility.  The antics that take place here could never happen, the press would go crazy over a candidate with no past, the people seem too gullible, McCann never says anything of substance, and the death of Hammond...well, a reviewer below said it, there is no way he would have been out riding a horse instead of at campaign headquarters.  It gets to be too much, but it still was highly entertaining 
 This is a wonderful collection of original Dolly Parton recordings.  Very enjoyable!!!  I love it! 
 Land of Forever by 2002 is one of my 5 top albums for relaxation, meditation, massage or intimate conversations.  I have played this album for a dozen or so people and everyone asks who it is because they like it so much.  It is not dance music.  The melodies are simple and kind.  I think this is 2002's best album... and I own them all.  One other nice thing about this album, the tempo is that of gentle breathing, and although each song is different, they all have the same relaxing style.  So you don't get some jarring world-beat trip right in the middle of your massage 
 These 5 stories are based on O Henry's short stories about the lives of the average human being. Very heartwarming and insightful. Most have a "message" about life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. Well acted and well written. Funny and poignant. My favorite is "Gift of the Magi" and the true meaning of love. Best if viewed with your family 
 How to be a part of real Rock History without being a musician, singer, producer or someone in the music business? Answer: Make a movie as this one. Almost every serious Rock fan and rock star must have seen this movie or if they haven't, they had better see it before they go out and give another interview. Believe me, there are bands and performers who still talk and give interviews like Spinal Tap did in this movie. This movie is made for these guys. Like me, if you have watched countless interviews of rockstars, popstars and movie stars you cannot do without this classic. The Lead guitarist was my favourite. I could give him an Oscar for his brilliant performance. If Jimmy Page used a bow on his guitar you must wait and see what the lead guitarist of  Spinal Tap does.  These guys literally become Gods by the way they poke fun at Rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live. In fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands.   One of the most famous lines from the movie apart from "This one goes to 11" is when the band is asked about one of their deceased members for which the band mates tell the interviewer (played by the director Rob Reiner himself) that the bandmate died of choking on vomit but they didn't know whose vomit!  Hilarious and highly entertaining you'll love this DVD with tons of goodies which are worth the price of the DVD alone. There is so much extra footage on the DVD that is seems like Spinal Tap 2.    The extras are as good as the original movie. I couldn't stop laughing when the band goes to the zoo and near the chimps cage when they are talking their usual ridiculous lines they say things like "'..chimps can't talk but can use computers.." and stuff. You wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this.     Neatly packaged even the liner notes are funny. Almost every move made and every line spoken is worth being labelled funny. One of the songs even caught my attention though the lyrics were insane.  A classic you cannot afford to miss 
 Awesome Soundtrack - Horrible Movie Magnolia is the only movie I have ever seen in the theater which gave me the urge to walk out in the middle.  The only reason I did not was because I went with friends and I did not drive. This soundtrack is wonderful - and only becasue Aimee Mann sings 9 out of 13 songs. I remember her mesmerizing voice when I first heard it about 20 years ago when she was the majority of Til Tuesday. She still moves me. I hope she never retires 
 Published in 1905, The House of Mirth offers a blistering social commentary on the lifestyles and behavior of super-rich society.  Having grown up in this society, Wharton evaluates it here as an insider, and her trenchant observations give this early novel a liveliness and verisimilitude not characteristic of "aristocratic" novels written by outsiders.  Set at a time in which the old, moneyed aristocracy was being forced to admit newcomers who had made their recent fortunes through industry, the novel shows moneyed society in flux, the old guard ensuring their exclusivity against parvenus who are not the "right type," at the same time that their sons and daughters were often securing large fortunes through marriage into some of these new families.  Lily Bart, a beautiful young woman of good family whose father lost everything when she was only nineteen, is left dependent on wealthy relatives in this society until she can charm a financially secure suitor into marriage.  At age twenty-nine, she is no longer a debutante, and the pressure is mounting for her to marry, though she lacks the unlimited financial resources of social rivals.  Still, her wit and charm make her a delightful companion, and she is never at a loss for suitors.  Intelligent enough to want a real marriage and not just a merger between families, she has resisted making a commitment to date, though the clock is ticking.  As Lily tries to negotiate a good marriage and future for herself, she is aware that the competition is fierce.  Women "friends" pounce on the latest gossip and spread rumors to discredit rivals, and Lily's reputation is tainted with hints of impropriety.  Her opportunities for a good marriage begin to dwindle, and when her aunt, Mrs. Peniston, dies and leaves her a bequest that covers only her debts, Lily is no longer able to compete in the society so attractive to her and begins her downward spiral.  Wharton creates a complete picture of turn-of-the-century New York society and its "important" people--their lack of scruples, their opportunism, their manipulations, and their smug self-importance, characteristics one may also see in Lily when she is part of this society, though there is a limit on how far she will stoop.   But Wharton also shows how quickly a woman may become an outcast when the money runs out and she is thrown on her own resources without any training for any other kind of life.  A well-developed melodrama filled with revealing details, this novel established Wharton's reputation as a novelist/commentator on the manners and morals of high society and those who would participate in it. n  Mary Whipple   
 The Neverending Story is a great fantasy movie that is wonderful for seven year olds, and seven year olds at heart. While at times some of the special effects are dated, the story itself stands the test of time.  The Neverending Story is a story about a small boy named Bastian who loses his mother and is told by his father to "deal with his pain" and grow up past the need for all his escapist fantasy books. Having read everything from Tarzan to the Lord of the Rings, Bastian discovers a book called the Neverending Story, and finds his way into the most fascinating ride of his life.  The creatures and fantasy beings in the story are incredibly unique and fun to watch. We really liked the Rock Biter, and the Swamps of Sadness.  The Neverending Story shares many wonderful endearing qualities with films such as the Wizard of Oz and Jumanji. If you are looking for a pure, simple and exciting escape, and a great movie for all ages, you can't go wrong owning this DVD. This is one our family bought.  Total Score (out of 100) = 76  40 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film. 6 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting? 8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story? 9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?  8 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting? 5 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase 
 The compositions are definitely good, but like another reviewer said, they're not played with the fire and enthusiasm of the originals. Typically, this means that the orchestral flow is not as "fluid" as the live band -- this composition tends to pronounce every note clearly (very staccato-like). If you're interested in only one fight song (from your alma mater, for example), you're better served to go to that university's website and order their marching band's CD. But, if you want a good overall list of cross-country fight songs, this is pretty good. It includes lyrics with each fight song, but be sure to double-check them with the actual words. A couple (California, and Ohio State) were a bit incorrect 
 It took me a few listens to really get into this album. I was expecting a whole lot based on some good reviews I had read in major magazines. I was expecting it to be more explicitly political and more explicitly critical of the rap industry and the whole "bling-bling, stripper-pole thing" that seems so prevalent in a lot of popular hip-hop these days. To be sure, this album is political and it is critical; it's just more subtle than I had anticipated. Nonetheless, the beats are hard, the hooks are sublime, and the ryhmes are classic Cube. Bottom line: If you have ever been a fan of Ice Cube, then you will like this record 
 We love all our Dr. Seuss books.  This one is so creative and fun.  The wording is clever and cute, and the creativity is fantastic 
 Finally someone with the courage to share about the Native Ceremonies to all colors.  I was recommended this book by a Lakota friend of mine, and was truly impressed.  While McGaa's writing style is a little more matter-of-factly than I would like, it shared very valuable information. . . Everything from an explanation of the Ceremonial Pipe, to Sun Dance as well as other wonderful ceremonies. Definately a great book for anyone interested in Native ceremonies, particularly the Lakota way 
 I really hate to give any "Chicken Soup" book less than a 5 star because I am a huge fan.   I was slightly disappointed in the content of this book. I really was hoping and expecting that it would have more stories about giving birth. It says on the cover that the 101 stories inspire and warm the hearts of soon-to-be-mothers but I felt like the subjects were too general.   For example, the contents are 1. We're Pregnant, 2. Nine Months and Counting, 3 Expectant Fathers, 4. Challenges along the Way, 5. Special Delivery 6. Small Miracle 7. Memorable moments, 8. On Motherhood, 9. Expectant Wisdom.   I didn't find many birth stories - in fact, I don't think there was even one.   However, in spite of my need for positive birth stories, I still love the stories that they put in the book.

 Sir Paul McCartney is a living legend in the rock-n-roll community, and an icon of Western popular culture. This album, which came out in 1987, includes tunes from the beginning of Sir Paul's post-Beatles career right down to that date. This is an excellent compilation, featuring tunes made with Wings, with Stevie Wonder, with Michael Jackson, and just with Paul himself.  This is a fantastic album that is sure to please any fan of Paul McCartney, or Wings. Heck, if you just love hearing some of the best music that came out of the 1970 and 80s, then you will love this album. This is a great album, one that I highly recommend to everyone. Buy it! 
 Whatever the setting (though it's always in Florida), Hiaasen is always on top of his subject. That goes double when he's talking about a small-town newspaper. Jack Tagger (age forty-six, soon to be forty-seven) was once a hot, even award-winning investigative reporter -- until he publicly humiliated the polo-playing CEO of the holding company that bought the paper where he labored. Now, since they're afraid to fire him,  he's exiled to the obituary desk, where he has become paranoid about his own life span compared to Jack Kerouac and Oscar Wilde and other notables who died at his own age. Not to mention the father he doesn't remember; how old was his old man when he croaked? (His crusty old mother won't tell him.) The plot concerns the death-by-scuba of James Bradley Stomarta, a/k/a Jimmy Stoma of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, a `70s-`80s rock group. His instincts begin to tell Jack that Jimmy didn't die naturally -- but who would want to kill him, and why? There's his rocker-wannabe wife, of course, and even his sister, and the surviving band members. So Jack starts to dig, hoping to thrash his way back to Page One. Hiaasen is great at devising wonderful characters with weird habits and this book is full of them. One of the most winning is twenty-nine-year-old Emma, Jack's editor, who didn't come up through the ranks as a reporter and whom he thinks he can still save from a terrible career error. (More to come on that relationship, though.) As always, the book is a romp, the dialogue is eye-rolling, the action is believable, and the hero isn't very heroic -- just like most of us. Why haven't more of Hiaasen's novels made it to the screen 
 Wow this movie is an eye opener. After watching it I can believe in almost any conspiracy theory,because they all sound more reasonable than the truth about the Government's Atomic testing programs. Back then people were told that mny forms of radiation will bounce harmlessly off human skin! Hosts of Kid Tv shows talked about bomb shelter preparedness! No wonder everyone went nuts in the 60's. It was backlash against all the "Atomic War" talk. Children were regularily reminded in classs that an A-bomb could hit at any time.Hmm explains alot about the Boomers. You probably already know that this movie is a collection of propaganda films shown in America to calm the fears of the public over nuclear war. It's brilliantly edited. Hope the makers have a long and prolific career. Some of it is VERY funny when you look back at the attitudes of the time. There's a great part where Nixon appears on a variety show with Nikita Kruschev, and Nikita makes Dick look pretty shabby as they attempt to one up each other on Aamerican national Tv.When you lack the people skills of even a hard line Communist Premiere then you know you're in trouble. Ah Dick, you should have learned. The most important message I got from this film is that the Gov't needs to be watched very closely to ensure its honesty. There are too many agendas floating around Washington that don't have the public's best interest in mind. Don't accept anything that is spoon fed to you because it's probably a load of crap. Except irradiated food, I'm sure the Gov't wouldn't let that happen if it wasn't safe. NOT! 
 I dont care if you are 11-40 its a great book for every one it made me cry and laugh it is a great story to help you to understand people with problems. It is my favorite book and you will love it to 
 Heavy D spits a lot of hot raps on this album and with musical production by his cousin Pete Rock on the most part how could you go wrong?  My favorite songs on here are "A Buncha N****'s"(great collab record with all the legendary mcs like Gangstarr, Busta Rhymes, and Notorious B.I.G.), "Here Comes The Heavster", "Blue Funk", "Who's In The House?", and "Who's The Man", recommended for fans that like classic hip-hop, don't sleep on this album you won't be dissapointe 
 I really like this exercise book.  It gives you an example of how to perform the exercise as well as variations of the exercise.  It tells you what part of your body you are working and that is extremely helpful when teaching a class.  I like that the books starts from your head to your toes and there are exercises for every part of the body.  I am getting a lot of use out of this book!! 
 Carlos Mencia has the guts to say things that very few comics today will. He is absolutely hilarious. I was laughing so hard I was in tears the 1st tiem i saw Carlos live. The album is great like the  title implies, people need to learn how to take a joke. The album is more cerebral than you might think, but there is plenty of slap stick style laugh out loud comedy on this album. A must buy for any fan of stand up 
 I found the book to be a wonderful depiction of my own childhood. Although the tragic events of a muderous time for a city which I love so dearly was presented, I found the simple pleasures of my childhood in Atlanta unfold before my eyes with such skill that I had to make myself put the book down. Tasha, Octavia and Rodney were all friends each of us could easily relate.Fifth grade was one of the most memorable times.Growing up in the projects of Atlanta myself, I also knew a few boys who like Jashante, were only trying to make a few bucks, not find death.A bouquet to Ms. Jones, for revealing a good side to a city shadowed by the darkness of these terrible deaths 
 This is one of the most spiritually enriching books I have ever read.  The insights into how God works in our lives is spellbinding. What Jesus asks of Faustina is truly remarkable.  It is sometimes hard to read, not because of the text but because of the sacrifices she is asked to make on behalf of others. One of the real eye-opening insights comes in paragraph 301 in which Jesus tells Faustina that to know God we should meditate on His attributes, and that the greatest attribute of God is His mercy. This book should be in the spiritual library of everyone seriously seeking to develop their relationship with God 
      This was more my speed.  I have to say saul bellow writes in a manner that is appealing to me, because he aptly dives into philosophy and sociological issues without a frenzied style like some other heavyweights in literature.  I noticed the lack of heavy fragmentation right off, yet there was enough to give the reader a sense of jumping in and out of moses' head and into the world around him.  I particularly liked the book's attention to the many distractions that we face everyday.  Moses represents the moral character of people trying to live by ideas, but he is continually distracted from doing so, because of the many different practical issues that spring up.  For instance, moses has to decide what he is going to do with his house in the berkshires (so it won't become more of a money pit than it already has) and he continually has to make practical decisions regarding Madeleine.  In academia one does tend to work a lot with ideas, but as humans we all must address many, many practical issues which tend to keep a person from completely retreating to the "ivory tower."  Bellow does an excellent job of representing the stress of trying to reconcile ideas with practicality in a relatively straightforward prose.  One of the main contradictions that we all must face, which bellow has handled very well, is sexual attraction and consciousness.  It seems if moses had really done a check on whether Madeleine was a good fit for him, he would have immediately decided to move on.  Instead, he seemed caught up in Madeleine's sexual attractiveness and its strong effect on nearly every man she met.   
 The only knock on these binoculars is that the image can be unsteady, but that's a product of the 16X magnification, so it's not really a product fault. If you've got a steady hand, you'll love these things. Great for sporting events or the theater, and great bang for the buck. Highly recommended 
 This movie is adorable and very funny !!!  One of the earlier classic "slapstick" comedies.  It is fun to see Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow when they were very young.  Hector Elizondo is hilarious as a jewel thief who is also very obsessed with how his hair looks.  My mom, sister and I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out on DVD.  This movie is right up there with "White Chicks" in comic escapades.  A true "must have" for the avid collector of classic "slapstick" comedies from the 1980's !! 
 I too was blown away by Howie's one man bandness at a Tori Amos show. Of all the singer/songwriters whose emergence have coincided with the newly refound brilliance of Nick Drake, Howie is the only one that doesn't come off as taking himself too seriously. His talent is unintentional and does not seem to be scripted. Plus he doesn't seem to be permanently stoned.. 
 Very good book. I suggest it to all designers, newbies and medium level, both 
 Its really a mixture of of two books, The Vampire Lestate, Queen of the Damned. It needed Tom Cruise back, but its not bad 
 Utterly amazing!!!   Even if you dont like some of the tracks on this album, you have to honour, stand speechless, faint or even die when you hear the piano solo on the title track Land Of Grey And Pink. It is THAT good. It creeps in, floats, shimmers, bows and gracefully tiptoes out giving way to a distorted organ. And you have to love the brrrrlllluurrrbbbbrrrrrbbbbb (the noice you make to babies) lead vocal toward the end.  Golf Girl is of similar structure (those power acoustic chords are amazing) without the atmosphere - more of a comic song.  I have the big double best of Caravan CD and recently got this (just for Land Of Grey And Pink as it happens) and cannot stop playing it.  FANTASTIC!! 
 I got this book a week ago and I have been reading it ever since.  It is a very good book that gives you a good idea about Linux "do" and "don't" in term of setting up secured Linux server.  I am kind of new in Linux, and this book does help me a lot to merge to open source 
 What can I say, Ottmar is Fanastic!! Listen to this CD all the time, workingout to when I am just relaxing 
 What a fun read! Nora wins again with an engaging and well-developed cast of characters, lots of action and suspense, and steamy love scenes. Her settings are always gorgeous. And this time, she's outdone herself on the ending. This is one of my favorites of hers that I've read thus far. It's definitely worth the read 
 This book illuminates the fact that the enzymes present only in raw foods are @ least as important as vitamins & minerals in the maintenance of optimum human health.  This well-documented work not only reminds us that  man is the only animal which cooks it's food but that cooked food is a  cultural perversion & an addiction which may actually be injurious to  health. The authors delightful writing style informs w/o intimidating the  reader w/ medico-chemical jargon.  While some critics might label this book  "controversial", such claims would be found baseless under the  cold, hard light of logic 
 I really liked this story. I think some of the strengths are all of the penguins and how curious they are.  It also tells some penguin facts. I think the story was very engaging.  It kept me interested through the whole story because it was funny.  I think this is a book for all ages.  Anyone who likes penguins. I really hope you decide to read this book. By: Tiff Meid 
 The Music Man is one of the greatest musicals and one of the greatest versions of The Music Man is the 1957 cast recording 
 This CD is somewhere between the #1 and #2 spot on my all-time favorites list. I have practically worn my disc out! I know this album back and forth; for a good reason! It has to be one of the best R&B debuts ever. If you have an appreciation for soul-inspired, sensuous and beautiful lyrics, hypnotizing vocals and a good groove... This is your answer.  I can't say enough good things about this album. Nothing is perfect, but this is darn close. This will ALWAYS be a classic. Go buy this one, it's a keeper 
 In "The Year of the Jackpot", a statistician graphs the points of convergence  of cyclycal events.  Overlapping his graphs, he notices that the   wavy lines are approaching extremes.  Interesting times. The story "By His Bootstraps" is not logically sound: How did Bob Wilson get to the other side of the Gate so that he could operate the Gate before sending for the first version of himself? "The Menace From Earth" tackles Earth Moon female jealousy. "Sky Lift" details the heroism of a rocket pilot carying an antidote to the Pluto colony.  "Goldfish Bowl" asks: What if humans were kept as pets by disinterested intelligent beings?  "Project Nightmare" is about Psionic humans who are able to locate nuclear devices and prevent atomic  fusion -- using psi ability.  "Water is for Washing" is about a mega earthquake that creates a new sea between the Pacific Plate and the  North American Plate.  The Gulf of California extends to Los Angeles 
 Another strong entrant in the "Original" series, with Bluemel's usual thorough research, beautiful and detailed photography and useful technical info for each model.  This book covers the golden era of Ferrari's road cars. Impatiently waiting for the second V-12 book 
 I have read several of the comments listed and as a personal comment this book helped me deal with the loss of my brother.  I was having a very hard time trying to deal with the "why" questions when I picked up this book.  Upon completion I found some closure to my questions. One might say that this is a simple minded book but for me it was exactly what I needed.  I have lent this book to many friends who also have found the impact of its pages.  I found this a must read 
 Another excellent book by Mr. Beard. Any Boy Scout wannabe (of any age or gender!) will enjoy this book. Practical and fun. Our boys wear their copies out 
 In my personal opinion (less than an hour after first watching it), I have determined that I have just finished another of many film tasks; to find something unique and striking, and discover a new perspective on a certain level. But this 'something' is also extremely well made, and deep; it's also incredibly sad, and visually grotesque (a few scenes made me recoil, a rare enough occurance for a man who owns at least 300 DVDs, and has seen countless films with more gore, and even more gratuitous carnage). It is also one of the very best films I have ever seen.   The film is about a man named Peter Winter (played by Peter Greene [if you don't know who he is, slap yourself]), whom was recently released from a mental hospital for reasons unspecified. From then on he makes a journey of sorts to find his daughter, Nicole. Of course, if the film was merely about a sappy kind of father/child reunion, I would have stopped watching mid-way and called it a night, but there is a very huge problem with Peter. He is a schizophrenic, a man whose brain functions almost like a car radio, tuning in signals, noises, and bizarre voices, all displayed aurally in juxtaposition to the visuals (the effectiveness of this audio technique is so disturbing and enthralling that even David Lynch's personal sound man could not better it's precision). This not A Beautiful Mind. There is no easy way out, and there is no solution for his problem, and the film makes it a point to show you why he acts the way he does. After a while, the effect becomes so oddly familiar, that when, in one scene, Peter's actions are separated from this horrifying noise, we chillingly see the reality of his situation. The only way Peter can (temporarily) relieve himself of this horror is best left for you to find out. If you have a weak constitution, or stomach lining, then consider this a film to avoid, to dread. One scene is of such stunning depravity that it may very well make you leave the room in a state of uttter shock.   Seemingly, in a decade which was known for being upbeat (both to it's credit and sizable detriment), this little puppy dropped out of the sky in 1993 and stunned whatever few people were fortunate enough to hear it or watch it. I implore you, be one of those people. 
 This book transformed my life. It gave me hope when I thought I was crazy (turns out I was not). It empowered me to take the reigns and drive. It helped uncover things about my life that I had not seen. It helped me see that I am not a victim. I don't have to sacrifice my needs and wants in order to get approval and acceptance from others. I am my own person and I don't have to let a relationship define me. I GET TO give myself permission to be in control of my choices. There is phenominal power in choices and for this I am SO GRATEFUL.    
 Ask a King fan what book is his best, and you will most likely hear "It" or "The Stand" as the answer. Maybe the occasional "The Shining", or you may have asked a Dark Tower fan who puts those books above and beyond the rest of the canon.  As for me, I'd simply say "Bag of Bones". I've read almost everything King's done, and a lot of it is great. Really great. He's easily my favorite author, but in my opinion nothing he's written has topped Bag of Bones.  I don't want to say much about the story, as you really need to just experience it yourself, but it is poignant, scary, and somehow awe-inspiringly beautiful.  Read it. You won't be disappointed. Then read his new one, Lisey's Story, which is in more than one way a kind of "mirror piece" when compared to Bag of Bones. By the way, I actually think I read once that King himself believes Bag of Bones to be his best. If so, he and I agree 
 The book shows pictures of Seattle then and now covering a lot of areas like Pioneer Square, First Hill, Belltown, Fremont and some of the water front. Though I wish more of the water front would have been covered. There are a lot of historical buildings that are no longer there shown in the book. A description is given for each picture of what area it is, what the pictures is of and when it was taken. The book shows a lot of change that has occurred in the city and that fact that the Brooklyn has probably changed the least. It's a fabulous coffee table book and a great conversation piece 
 I simply adore this book and it's what made me go out to buy every other Nora Roberts novel.  It just amazes me the chemistry between Luke and Roxanne.  Everytime I read it I can't get over the excitement and the smile it brings to me as they barb back and forth.  It's just an amazing story over the course of growing up together and how it all develops.  Roxanne is smart and sassy and Luke is just too cool.  This romantic duo shines and no one else compares to them yet for me.  My very favorite romance 
 Please don't believe all those other reviews!  This Movie is the BEST!!!  It's a movie not history class.  Buy it and ENJOY it!!!  Do 
 This is a very entertaining collection of quirky old Jewish vaudeville-type songs. Yes, they sound scratchy, because a number of them were taken from really old (wax cylinders, even) recordings, but we like old radio stuff, so this didn't bother us. These were all pieces that we had never heard before, and we love them. Uncensored, self-effacing American Jewish humor. Cultural history in a jewelcase. What's not to like 
 Nevada Barr is fast becoming one of my favorite mystery writers, and Flashback is one of the best mysteries I've read this summer.   National Park Service Ranger, Anna Pigeon, has been transferred to Dry Tortugas National Park as a temporary supervisory ranger.  The Dry Tortugas are off the Florida Keys, and Garden Key (part of the national park) is the home of Fort Jefferson.  This fort served as a military installation and also, a jail during and after the Civil War.    Soon after Anna arrives, mysterious events start happening.  A fellow ranger disappears, a speedboat explodes and sinks with at least one victim, and Anna starts to think she's going crazy (the malady that caused her predecessor to take a short-term leave).  At first, it appears that these things are unrelated, but Anna eventually starts to piece this puzzle together.  At the same time, she begins reading letters written by her great aunt, Raffia Coleman.  Raffia's husband was an officer at Ft. Jefferson during the Civil War, and she writes copious letters to her sister about the trials and tribulations of living on the fort.  There was also a mystery at the fort in 1865, and soon, the boundaries between past and present are soon blurred.  Barr alternates the chapters between past and present, and each one ends in a cliffhanger, with the intensity mounting with each chapter.  It is difficult to tell if Anna will escape this book with her life and/or her sanity.    As with all Barr books, we learn something new about another National Park.  The Dry Tortugas was named because the keys were filled with turtles and there was no fresh water source.  Dr. Samuel Mudd was the most famous prisoner on Garden Key, and he is best known for treating John Wilkes Booth's leg after Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.  He was eventually pardoned because of his heroics treating yellow fever victims at Fort Jefferson.  Barr weaves him into the story, but in an entirely fictional way.  I have two complaints about Flashback, but one is that of my own doing-I haven't read them in order.  Also, I was just a bit confused when she first switched to the flashback mode.  But at least the good news is that I still have nine more books to go.   
 The concept of body mind connection and being able to change the way you age with the analysis of your belief system. It really is about getting out of your own way so that you may live the life you consciously choose and this read is a fairly clear path.  
 A hilarious look back at what passed for culinary ambition ca. the 1950s and the 1960s, and any of us who grew up in the Wonder Years will recognize this material from ads of the day, recipe clippings and recipe books that our mothers kept on the refrigerator, and the kinds of processed food that we ate (my God, it took me a decade of adult life to realize that mashed potatoes didn't have to have the uniform consistency of mayonnaise -- i.e., out of a box). This book is a howler, guaranteed, as long as your significant other doesn't mistake it for a recipe book. It certainly will make you glad you live now and not as the way we were 
 I read this book a number of years ago and came across it again when researching a move into a small condo.  I agree that it is a wonderful book as the antithesis of potterybarn and restoration hardware living that is enough to kill anyone with an independant idea- and while the author's style is too fussy for me, I love the text and the pace of the book.  I would highly recommend it to someone who believes in interior decoration as a theory, a passion, if not a practicality 
 Patti Smith is a poet a mucisian a great songwiter she has a great band. Discone has songs like Pissing in a river intense song Summer Cannibals clever catchy song Ghost dance great Glitter in their eyes. disc two has  piss factory Renaldo beach Distant fingers Wander i go  Deadcity Boy cried wolf great song good spoken part all the live tracks are good Higher learning is great with agreat clarennet solo and steady drums Land is a great collection it blew me away 
 The Essential Cheap Trick is a fine compilation with both the classics ("Surrender," "I Want You To Want Me," "The Flame" etc...) and a lot of really great songs that aren't as widely played in the mainstream and have been somewhat forgotten (of these I recommend "Tonight It's You" and "This Time Around," which is a really beautiful song.) This album covers a period of almost thirty years in the history of one of rock's best kept secrets. It is refreshing and a real treat, and I highly recommend it for both the old fans and the newly curious alike 
 It is a great book that my boss suggests me to read. And I think the author has told the trut 
 OK, I've been watching Woody's movies fot years. But 'Broadway Danny Rose' is the best thing he has ever done. THE BEST!!! Forget all the others, this one is the real deal. I could never get into Woody's "I'm a pathetic nerd who can't get a woman" characters, but he is absolutly brilliant as a loser theatrical manager. And Nick Apollo Forte?? BRILLIANT!! Now I've personally met Mr Forte, and he is one helluva nice guy. Plus he is a true entertainer! Buy this DVD-you wont regret it 
 The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off!  I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please! 
 This is an excellent book. All Brave Sailors by Revell Carr covers the same story in much greater detail and is also recommended highly 
 Silverstein is the very essence of emo. They have some EXTREMELY talented guitar players. wow. The lead singer's voice is Amazing, and the lyrics are wonderful. By far one of the most professional bands in the industry. This record doesn't sound like some kid recording from his garage. I definitely recommend it, but only if you're not looking to be cheered up 
 I have mostly shied away from Christian novels, especially Janette Oke's, but decided to pick this one up and give it a try.  Instead of getting a preachy, dry as sandpaper story, I was surprised to get a nice, wholesome story of an incredibly warm and likable family full of strong characters and a good plotline.  I found the rivalry between the girls over the schoolteacher's son both humorous and as frustrating as Marty did, and liked the way Belinda's family subtley reached out to the Simpsons who were too proud to accept charity from any of the neighbors.  My favorite characters in this book had to be Marty, Belinda, and her relationship with her older brother Luke as she learned nursing by doing.  More than anything, I got Oke's unmistakable message in this book:  When you want to win someone over to your beliefs, you don't ram them down their throats, but by patiently waiting as you set an example that will eventually draw them in.  
 Mona Charen's book is a devastating indictment of far left figures who consistently and repeatedly proved willing to excuse, explain away, and apologize for the most horrid of atrocitities and crimes in order to, as Malcolm Muggeridge put it "preserve intact the confident expectation that one of the most thorough-going, ruthless and bloody tyrannies ever to exist on earth could be relied on to champion human freedom, the brotherhood of man, and all the other good liberal causes to which they had dedicated their lives."  This book uses these people's own words to show how frankly deluded and blinded by their ideology they were.  I see there is no shortage of useful idiots on this board reviewing this book.  One, who calls Charen's book "fascistic" observes that America "acts in its own interests" (well DUH! what state doesn't or ever hasn't?), and that it "acts against the interests... of the majority of the American people"  Yes, it acts so much against our interests that we enjoy one of the highest levels of civil liberty and one of the highest standards of living of any any country that has ever existed, and people are coming here in droves the grass looks so green here.  Does this mean that I am blind to America's faults.  Of course not.  Neither is Ms. Charen.  America has its share of crimes and mistakes to answer for, just as any other country does.  From our treatment of the natives of this continent to our propping up dictators who oppressed their own people, to racist policies we once embraced, we fall far short of perfection.  But when this reviewer criticizes the author for supposedly refusing to "see that the US state has ever done anything wrong" he's being obtuse.  I'm sure the US has done many, many things Ms. Charen does not approve, but that is not the purpose of this book.  It's purpose is to reveal and highlight the gross deficiencies and errors of judgement of many on the political left, and that purpose is simply not served by a rehash of America's faults and failings.  I see a lot of other negative reviewers condemning this books as "liberal bashing" (sorry, but it's not bashing when what they are saying about you is true), "anti-democratic blather", "clueless", "unmitigated garbage", and the list goes on and on.  But strangely, I see none of these critics able to refute the obvious and incontrovertible truth that the people Charen lambastes in this book undeniably were guilty of severe lapses in judgement, uncritical acceptance of communist propaganda, astonishing double standards in comparing the West with the communist bloc, and disgraceful apoligizing for some of the most blood-soaked regimes ever seen in human history.  These critics can't refute this because Charen uses these people's own words to condemn them.  Over and over again in Russia, China, Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, and other lands she points out that the major export crop of communist countries was refugees.  And she points out each time that the fact that what these refugees fled was terror, mass-murder, and political oppression went completely unacknowledged or condemned by a great many liberal intellectuals.  On the contrary.  Many of them gushed with praise for these "socially progressive" countries.  Ignoring all the while the heaps of corpses on which these "workers' paradises" were built.  These are the FACTS.  And now, many of these same liberal intellectuals are doing it all over again with a new enemy: militant Islamists, which is all the more astonishing, since the Islamists don't even pay lip service to the ideas of democracy, freedom, or the people the way the communists did.  No, America is not perfect or infallible, and if the critics will open their eyes for once, they might see that Charen has never claimed it was.  What she is claiming, and what she is right in claiming, is that for all our faults, we were nonetheless orders of magnitude better than our old Cold War enemies, or our new Islamofascist ones.  If you don't realize this, you've got a broken moral compass 
 Popped it in, works like a charm. Hardest part is opening the packaging, but other than that no worries

I WILL BUY THIS MOVIE FOR MY SLEEP OVER PARTY THIS YEAR TO WATCH WITH MY FRIENDS IT'S AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 As guidebooks to Hawaii go, the Rough Guide is a reasonably comprehensive resource with solid, middle-of-the-road information about all the islands. The challenge in covering the whole state within a single tome is that author Greg Ward has to pitch his research at a necessary cursory level and spends approximately 60-70 pages on each island. Consequently, if you choose to focus on one or two islands, as most travelers do, the book ends up being somewhat lacking on the details that really can separate a good vacation from a great one.  Beyond the color maps in the middle, the book is all text, so it does require concentration to absorb much of the information presented. However, Ward provides helpful information on preparing for your trip, choosing accommodations and eateries, and exploring the more popular attractions. What's missing is the off-the-beaten path insight that, for example, Andrew Doughty provides in spades in his book, "Maui Revealed". The other gap is a vivid perspective on what the must-do activities are. Consequently, this is not an all-encompassing resource but one that needs to be complemented by other books that specialize on the islands you visit or the personal research you need to conduct on your own. Regardless, it's still a solid resource 
 With all of the different cuts of meat available today, it is easy to be confused about what to buy and how to cook it. I was particularly interested in how to bring out the flavor and tenderness in some of the cheaper cuts.  So I bought this book, and it didn't disappoint.  Not only do the authors explain everything under the sun about how to choose and buy meat and which cuts work best with different types of cooking methods, but they also provide scores of delicious recipes.  For most types of meat, they will give you a "master recipe" outlining the basics, and then a range of flavor/sauce variations.  The recipes range from good to excellent-- they call for a nice variety of ingredients, but they are not by any means overly-sophisticated or inaccessible. Lisa's Lazy Pot Roast is the best pot roast I've ever made.  The book has also introduced me to methods for improving my execution of dishes I was already familiar with. Thanks to the authors, my stovetop porkchops are much juicier than they had been before.  The temperature doneness chart alone almost justifies the price of the book-- I'm constantly referring to it whether or not I'm using one of the book's recipes. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves meat and wants to broaden their horizons in this area 
 one problem though - only four songs! these four songs though... wow. millions of stars i give this ep. 4 or 5 years ago, this material was my introduction to music that heavily incorporates screaming vocals. words cannot begin to do this release any justice. the lyrics are extremely well written and thought out (it's defititely cool to read them while listening to the songs). the music is packed with so much energy that you just feel like jumping around. i cannot think of one aspect to complain about - it's that great. this ep is way up on the list of best musical pieces i have purchased or listened to (and i have a collection of well over 200 music cds, plus an awful lot of albums on other formats). maybe not for the technicality, but for the overall sound the guitars are in my opinion some of the best guitar compositions i have heard (greats like hendrix/fripp/clapton destroy them of course, but for modern music i think they're extremely impressive). drums sound good too, never resorting to typical beats (the drummer is by no means a danny carey, but still keeps the listener interested). music goes from point a to point b and never back to point a, which i love. for those that don't like screaming, try to listen to this and try to accept it for what it is - if you are not narrow minded you will realize the complexity and beauty in the songs and will perhaps even enjoy them. for those that don't like it, return to your mtv 
 People really need to get over the fact that movies adapted from Stephen King novels aren't exactly like the novels! Get over it! With that being said, this film is probably one of my favorites. The acting in it is awesome. I don't think anybody really gives Fred Gwynne the credit he deserved as dramatic actor. Everyone remembers him from the Munsters but he had the ability to portray sadness in such a moving way. Take note of his acting after the funeral scene. I truly love this movie. Other good movies that were based on Stephen King's novels are: "Carrie", "The Shinning", "It", "Salem's Lot", & "Silver Bullet". I love these movies and there's an added bonus because of the King relation. I guess I wouldn't recommend any of these movies to those Hard-Core King fans. Just remember that it would have taken about 9 hours to make "It" exactly like the novel!!! If you've never read the book, check out this movie. It's so great!  
 Photographer and professor David Ulrich's The Widening Stream: The Seven Stages Of Creativity is a guide to creativity and an artistic, spiritual piece which guides readers through various stages of the creative process. The premise here is that creative impulse can be taught; not just inherited: chapters provide exercises and tools to help the reader uncover creative potential 
 So I was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages... could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality... So i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11$. AND it works, I used it for two weeks now and I am pretty satisfied. Just like there is one more review on this item... and it says that it is strong and sturdy.. I AGREE. It is a great item for the money. Vitalijus Stony 
 All good songs on the CD! As for them being AM Radio tunes, thats where Top 40 was located. Many cars did not even have FM mono radios in them yet by 1972! Also nice to know, Tracks 1, 8, 9 and 10 are ALL sung by the same artist. I believe his name was Tony Burrows & he was from Great Britain. He also had a hit with a little novelty tune titled "Gimmie Dat Ding" 
 This book was out of print just a short while after it was originally published in 1974.  The author, who currently enjoys a bit of a cult status, was an unknown at the time and this book slipped under the radar screen.  But with his popularity growing ever stronger with each of his books, many of which now are out of print, the publisher "Overlook" has recently republished this book , now available in hardback for all McCarry fans.  This is my first McCarry novel, but it will not be my last.  McCarry tackles the Kennedy assassination in this his first book.  I was a bit reluctant at first to read this book because I was frankly tired of all the silly conspiracy theories revolving around Kennedy's assassination.  I think that the lone crazy assassin theory has been largely vindicated.  I am tired of the ridiculous grassy knoll Oliver Stone nonsense.  These theories held a certain fascination for me when I was much younger, but no more.  This book however approaches the assassination from an entirely different perspective.  I won't give away the plot line by discussing McCarry's theory, but suffice it to say, he does not insult our intelligence.    This book is a very intelligent, elegant, and cleverly written story about the assassination and the world of espionage.  His story and his characters make sense.  He does not stretch credulity to the breaking point.  I'm not saying that I endorse the theory of this book only that it is plausible.  And that's what makes for such an interesting read.    Paul Christopher, the protagonist, David Patchen, his Harvard college roommate and now his supervisor, Tom Webster, his case officer, Tom's wife Sybille Webster, and Paul's girlfriend Molly are all immensely likable and believable characters who, no doubt, we will hear from again in later novels.    If you enjoy historical fiction and have any interest in Vietnam, the Kennedy assassination, and the inner workings of the CIA during this period then you will thoroughly enjoy this very good first effort by a fine writer.    P.J. O'Rourke has called McCarry the "absolute best thriller writer alive."  This is very high praise and in this case well deserved praise 
 In "The Question of Palestine" author Edward W. Said analyzes the complexity in recognizing the Palestinian plight that has plagued a society since the establishment of Israel.  Said eloquently illustrates a different perception to the omnipresent and biased understanding of the Palestinian/Israeli issue.   It was enlightening to analyze Said's version on the international conflict, not simply because I am sympathetic to a society under foreign occupation and in exile, but rather because it is a perspective not often pursued by the American general public.  	 "The Question of Palestine" depicts the effects of Zionism and how its blatant disregard of Palestinians is culpable for the ongoing strife in the region.  Said describes the historical context in which the existence of Palestinians was disregarded from the very onset of Israel's creation.  The author explains that his purpose in writing this book was to illustrate how the Palestinian's perceive Zionism.   	Although Said is clearly an enthusiast for the Palestinian cause, he credits Israel's political organization, cultural achievements, and economic stability as the strength behind Israel's permanence.  What I find fascinating about this book is that it addresses issues often ignored by America's biased media.  American society has yet to adequately analyze the inhumane political and social injustices suffered by the Palestinians.  In fact, often is the case that news coverage of Arabs in the region reinforce an already inbred stereotype of Middle Eastern society, that chaos and violence is a standard practice.    	Said also emphasizes on how Israel, once a victim of oppression, has evolved into an oppressor.  In "The Question of Palestine," Said explains how Palestine has been plagued by acquisition and occupation.  In his book, Said describes his view of Israel as an imperialistic society.  He also addresses the issue that the Palestinians were not consulted when their land was given to a new society for development.   In essence, Said explains how the existence of the Palestinians was thought of as a minimal complication that will dilute with time.  However, the reality of the matter is that the identities of the Palestinians are far from accepting defeat.   	In "The Question of Palestine" Said describes how nearly 4 million Palestinians are scattered throughout the world.  In this book Said questions how nothing is said when it is irrefutable that Israel is responsible for the deportation, torture, and transfer of population of millions of Palestinian Arabs.  Said gives his readers an account of the Palestinian reality -- a struggle in which the natives are the disadvantaged.   	Fundamentally, the purpose of Said writing this book was to bring attention to a vaguely commented issue - the reality of the Palestinian refugees.  An issue that Said describes as ignored, or willfully misrepresented is no longer so. "The Question of Palestine" provokes its readers to question an issue that would not commonly be addressed.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Middle Eastern politics and to any individual on gaining insight on an issue that is unfortunately not often discussed.   
 Barry Sonnefeld's "Get Shorty" was in many people's opinions the best adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel to that point. John Travolta, who had just made his big comeback performance in Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" scored another massive hit with his role of Chili Palmer, a Miami lone shark who gets sent to Hollywood to muscle a B-movie producer but ends up getting swept in by the business. Along for the ride is an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo, Dennis Farina, and James Gandolfini. "Get Shorty" is a fun, hip good time. The DVD special edition includes a deleted sequence involving Ben Stiller, an audio commentary, and a number of extra featurettes. 
       9 year old lily, witnessed the murder of her whole family. With no one place to go to Eve opened her home to the child to keep her safe and to find the assasins. As Eve get closer to finding the murderers she's put herself in grave danger.    The story is amazing and has some shocking twist, it keep you guessing who the villans are. And brings you to almost tears as this innocent girl deal with the death of her family 
 Ahh, this is grand Sci-fi from the old swashbuckling days of Sci-fi space opera.  Our heroes from the Legion appear yet again to save mankind.  My favorite, Giles Habibula (based on Falstaff) appears once again in this time twisting adventure.  Turn off your expectation of hard Sci-fi, and strap on your blaster, fire up the Geodyne engines and we are off 
 Some of the reviews I have just read are rather misleading. "If you are a white male who is secretly racist this book will validate your feelings"? Uh-uh.  I discovered this book when the Times put it on the top 100 list. It is a story of a Gen-Xer white male, working class, growing up during Detroit's decline. The main theme is the white flight and resignation whites feel about a mayor, Coleman Young, who is clearly paranoid and unprofessional at the very least.   Clemens refuses to join in the race prejudice that is relatively easy and done on a low level, but when a legitimate anger towards a criminal (who raped his wife) comes up and he learns the attacker is black, he briefly feels tempted down that path. But he never does, basically forever pondering race relations and how to connect to black people beyond the Coleman Young--white flight--civil rights cliches everyone falls back on.  Incidentally, there are a lot of funny scenes here, of Clemens growing up typically male and goofing off with his friends. Women are treated with respect, although face it, this is not a book about Clemens and women! Duh, obviously women are not centra characters much of the time, Detroit itself is. Also, there are lots of positive blacks--his coworkers at the parks deptartment, his coworkers at the city office, his ROOMMATE.   Don't let someone's predictable need to race-bash keep you from reading yet another memoir trying to jump into the charged atmosphere of race and try to be evenhanded about things! 
 Like all of Dr Ross's books, this one gives a very good explanation of the cohesion between the Bible and Science.  I recommend it as well as "Creation and Time" and "The Creator and the Cosmos".  P.S.  If you'll notice, most of the anti-Young-Earth-Creationist reviews have been given "this review is not helpful" marks by many readers, and most of the pro-YEC reviews (and therefore anti-Dr-Ross reviews) have been given "this review is helpful" marks.  Take those ratings with a pillar of salt (a-HA!) because it's a result of "stuffing the ballot box" by the pro-YEC crowd.  (I expect this review to get a bunch of "not helpful" marks too...) 
 Wow. Eichman and Heydrich calmy discussing the fate of millions over a buffet business meeting. One could not imagine how could this be possible but it actually happened in less than 2 hours! Chilling in detail, horrifying in content, The fate of Europe's jews were decided in an almost casual, cold detached business-like manner. The acting was superb. If you are interested in the Third Reich or a serious student of History this dvd is for you 
 As far as American animation goes,(as in comparison to Japanese Anime)it has a lot weaker history to look back to. This animation leaves the constraints of normal American cartoons for the semi-traditional samurai anime style. The first time I watched this, I was blown away! The drawings and settings are fantastic, and the music is some of the best ever made for cartoons. The plot is direct and constant, but still leaves room for wild twists with all sorts of enemies. As a whole, one of the best American cartoons in history 
 Christopher Morley on Christopher Morley: "His early writing, which was (though not intentionally) imitative and immature, was received with absurd overpraise." Morley's self evaluation was overly critical. Now, nearly 90 years later, Morley's early works, especially Parnassus on Wheels (1917) and its sequel, The Haunted Bookshop (1919), are still widely praised.  Roger Mifflin, the exuberant, irrepressible, itinerant book seller, is one of the most beloved characters of twentieth century fiction. But the central character in Parnassus on Wheels is really Helen McGill, the pragmatic and hardworking sister of the much admired writer, Andrew McGill.  Having baked some 6,000 loaves of bread for her brother in the last fifteen years, Helen was primed for change. When Roger Mifflin placed his horse-drawn library, Parnassus, for sale at $400, Helen, age 39, withdrew her savings and began the adventure of her life. As a neighbor exclaimed, "Think of Parnassus turned suffrage!"  Parnassus on Wheels, like its marvelous sequel, The Haunted Bookshop, is a delightful mix of engaging characters, lively plot, and thought provoking, common sense philosophy. Christopher Morley, later founder and editor of the Saturday Review, cleverly employed his remarkable traveling bookseller to expound on Morley's own deep commitment to good literature. Here is one of Roger Mifflin's most quoted statements: "Lord!" he said, "when you sell a man a book you don't sell him just twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue - you sell him a whole new life." Whatever you do, don't stop with Parnassus on Wheels. Immediately find a copy of its splendid sequel, The Haunted Bookshop. Cheers 
 Grimms had a superb storyline but this version of Red Riding Hood by Trina Schart Hyman is a Perfect Example for the kids to follow in their day to day life. Red Riding Hood is a sweet innocent girl who in her childishness, does not obey her mom nor keeps her promise. She lacks in her manners but is a friendly, social girl who loves animals and nature. This version has minimum violence illustration. It sets a perfect example to the child with moral values to be good, obedient, careful, keep to promises and the sort. Good for classrooms or parental teach. A child centered tale, the book offers fun and entertaining with a moral in a renewed way and is a good collection of these series of stories in the library. A good Buy and gift for kids 
 Barry Crimmins grew up in Skaneateles, NY, and was a fixture in Boston stand-up comedy or years.  We learn a lot about this, his family, and his opinions about politics today in this series of very funny essays covering topics such as 9/11, corporate corruption, Henry Kissinger, the Clintons, activism, Dennis Miller, comedy, Reagan, Air America Radio, NPR, the Iraq War, etc.  Scattered between the essays are one-liners  (Bush says he is eating beef and isn't vaguely concerned about the possibility of mad cow disease.  Of course he isn't--the disease attacks the brain.)  If you're a progressive, there are lots of lines that will make you nod or smile or laugh (Not since Ronald Reagan have we had a president who is as stupid as he is evil.)  Conservatives who've drunk the Bush kool-aid will not enjoy this, but all others will 
 I liked this book becuase I liked finding out of Henny was gong to get any babies,and finding out if the Tomten was goiong to be tricked or if he was going to eat all of her eggs. It is hard to read the words in the book because of the colored pages.  The words are good for 5 to 8 year olds to read.  Hedgie has a lot of tricks, and helps Henny 
 I have read several books on verbal self defense and this is by far the best. It contains techniques that are simple and easy to remember. Most of these methods are in the form of a statement that you can make. The only thing you have to remember is that although these tactics look and read very good on paper, real life situations are a different story, in that, when you employ these techniques, people might not react the way you anticipate them to in the short term. But, I am confident that if you employ these tricks on a regular basis, you will see some positive long term results 
 While the book could have been a little more dense it was a good read overall. I would have liked to have seen more focus on North American hardwoods, but that aside the book was very informative. About 150  different woods are described in detail with acompaning pictures. There is  also a nice section on fine furniture. This book is an excellent  introduction into the world of wood working and would make a fine gift for  anyone with even a passing interest in that direction 
 This is a great intro to Tibetan Buddhism, although towards the end it gets too repetitive. You can probably just read the first half and get everything you need to know. Also, it is really written from the perspective of the more traditional Buddhist teachings, i.e. Hinayana or Theraveda, as opposed to the mystical Tibetan teachings that form the basis for Tantra or Mahayana forms. So if you are just starting out on your study of Tibetan Buddhism, by all means read this book, but don't stop there 
 In an era filled with bland, generic rock that is hesitant to transcend a cookie-cutter set of time signatures and verse structure, it's refreshing indeed to step back in time a little to listen to this opus by the ill-fated Alice in Chains. If anyone has any question as to whether Alice in Chains was as talented as its Seattle contemporaries, this album is the answer.   Jar of Flies delivers the angst-ridden grunge that AiC fans want, while also experimenting with different musical styles to produce an album that is as diverse as it is solid. If you want to hear the gold standard for rock music--and not just the mediocre, 4-4-time bare minimum to which most rock artists aspire these days--this album is a must-have for your collection. Jar of Flies is what happens when a band sits down and actually engineers an album from start to finish, rather than just pumping out a dozen half-baked tracks to fulfill a contractual quota. Every aspect of this album, from the track order to the lyrics, is carefully orchestrated to tell both a musical and literary tale of loss.  If I could give this album more than 5 stars, I would 
 Esslin outlines important facts about this complicated and confusing theatrical movement.   He helps provide a basic understanding for anyone who would like to know about Beckett, Ionesco, Adamov, Genet, and Pinter.   Absurdism is probably the least understood of all modern theatrical  movements of the twentieth century, but Esslin makes it accessible.  If you  study, teach, design,or perform in the theatre you need to read this book,  it is the authoritative text on absurdist theatre 
 When my friend recommended this book, I was skeptical. I didn't believe an American journalist could successfully infiltrate a gang of European football hooligans. I was introduced to the notoriety of hooligans when I attended a match in Turkey. There I witnessed 200 soldiers armed with assault rifles and riot gear, lined up behind the goalie. This severity made me believe what I'd heard about fans ending up trampled, stabbed, beaten, and killed in the aftermath of a match.  Starting with a few lukewarm leads, Bill Buford, a true journalist, is relentless. He transports the reader to England, Germany, and Italy as he tries to understand what fuels hooligans. You experience the helplessness of being caught in a body-crushing crowd, being ambushed by the brutal mobs after the match, and riding the fan-crammed trains. His characterizations are so vivid, you can almost smell the charged atmosphere in the streets and in the stadiums.  This book is about violence. The descriptions are fierce and don't let up. The history behind the European football fury is discussed. Even if you aren't a fan of football (better known to Americans as soccer), this book is an excellent read on the sociology of mob mentality. You become aware of what propels crowd violence and its devastating effects on the victim, whose only blunder might be unfortunate proximity and timing 
 I received this book in perfect condition as promised and received it in time.  I would order agai 
 I got this recording on CD back in the early 90's before I really knew who any of these guys were, and I loved every song on it just for it's raw exuberance.  I was into other Chicago outfits such as NAKED RAYGUN, MINISTRY and THE JESUS LIZARD, and I knew that this Albini guy just produced a PJ HARVEY album and was rumored to be hooking up with NIRVANA, so I decided to give them a try.  Now 15 years later, the CD has taken on legendary/super group status in my collection of over 600 CD's.  RAPEMAN is Albini's musical project which bridges the gap between his older work as a guitar-grinding freak (BIG BLACK) and his early stuff as a producer and musician (SLINT, SHELLAC).  Teaming up with Albini are bassist David W. Syms (SCRATCH ACID, JESUS LIZARD) and drummer Rey Washam (SCRATCH ACID, MINISTRY).  All 3 of these guys made their mark on the Chicago underground music scene well into the 90's.  What's nice about RAPEMAN is it has all of the brutality and twingy, machine gun guitar of BIG BLACK, but it adds real drums, as "Roland" has been kicked to the curb.  The best track on the CD, in my opinion, is "Trouser Minnow," a song about a shallow girl who just can't stop having sex with strange men in odd places.  The lyrics are sung from the girl's point of view, which takes some getting used to.  It was hard to picture Steve screaming out, "I gotta stop drinkin' around men--they take advantage of me!"  Also, the ZZ Top cover ("Just Got Paid") is pretty good as well.  If you're a fan of 80's Chicago punk, or a fan of SHELLAC, BIG BLACK, JESUS LIZARD or SCRATCH ACID, this CD is a must-have 
 The warrior on the cover is staring at an UFO on the album cover. On this CD he is staring at the sky! I guess after awhile the saucer took off! Great CD, but , and there always is that big old but, the bonus tracks are poorly recorded 
 While some Egyptologists may disagree with this view of Hatchepsut, I find this book a great analytical look of evidence to create a woman who was neither evil, conniving, nor power-hungry as the old view had her be. Tyldesley's writing was clear and easy to read, as well as being amusing at times. This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn about Egyptian culture as well, since she does very well at creating the background context. I highly recommend this book for any scholar of Egypt 
 The Art of Pilgrimage isn't just for the "spiritual traveler." It's for anyone who wants to do more than visit a shopping mall. Even business travelers can use this book--they'll be inspired to make even short jaunts meaningful by taking a half day off to visit someplace special, and experiencing it with attention and purpose. Cousineau stresses that every trip--whether to The Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, your ancestral village in Ireland, or the magnificent temples in Ankor Wat in Cambodia--can be sacred and soulful if the traveler's heart and imagination are open to experiencing it. With chapters that cover the cycle of the journey, "the longing," "the call," "departure," the pilgrim's way," "the labyrinth," "arrival," and significantly "bringing back the boon," Cousineau's book is the ultimate pep talk for getting ready for, and experiencing what will surely become an unforgettable soulful adventure. With wonderful photographs and illustrations, this makes a great gift for anyone who loves travel. Anyone going anywhere should buy this book first 
 One of the things I learned was about personal commitment to one's self.  By regards of others I may not have a huge amount of weight to lose but I've benn procrstinating about it and worried that this will become a lifestyle choice.  Sure I look fine now but I'm still pretty young and this has to be a lifelong commitment.  I got moving with Oprah and Bob in the 90's and did a massive turnaround but then I got into the work swing and got complacent, not to mention being so close to Delmonicos!  I love food, to eat it and to cook it but the simple mathematics is that I have to exercise more calories than I consume.  Simple as that.  And something really BIG, you're suppose to feel slightly hungry.  I think thats a great point, most peopel believe you're suppose to constantly be full 
 I don't know what it says about me when I'm rooting enthusiastically and nonstop for the antihero and am almost in tears when the killer dies at the end.  Of course, we expect Henry to redeem himself at the end.  But he does it unexpectedly, not just by showing Miguel the road out of hell (which Miguel already seems to have found for himself) and by showing Aunt Anna the way out of her personal hell but by the continuing love of his suffering parents. The writing is spare.  The dialogue to the point.  And the descriptions the barely necessary.  It seems to be the author's signature style. This is certainly not a book for every sensibility and the series is not for the faint of heart.  But if you enjoy hard boiled noir which pulls no punches, run and read the trilogy in order 
 Jean Feldman gives many great ideas for all curriculum areas in this handbook.  There are interesting activities for math, language, science and art centers along with easy group games with emphasis on having fun rather  than competition.  This book even contains fun recipes children can prepare  with little help and ideas for special celebrations. These ideas are  divided into convenient categories which makes finding the  "right" activity a breeze.  This is a must-have handbook for  early childhood educators 
 Siblings are the toughest issue. As one of three and the parent of three, I have considerable experience. But this book helped me see the issues with my kids in a clearer light and permitted me to exhale. A must read 
 I got the DVD for my birthday and absolutely loved it.  I've been a fan since the beginning and this DVD has put a goofy grin on my face.  I highly recommend it for any Cheap Trick fan 
 The Swrod in the Stone is the first in a mini-series, and by far the best. The others are really flat in comparison. I just love this book, it describes all the magic of being young and exploring the fields and rivers around your home, and talks of fights between rather nasty witches and pleasant wizards. The writing is so good I felt like I was actually lying in the grass on a summery day watching people joust! Young Wart gets up to some crazy adventures, and the book has a nice happy ending. The author certainly introduces some interesting characters, and overall, I found it a joy to read, and one of the few books I reread regularly 
 We received this book many years ago as a gift upon becoming parents.  It is a wondeful reminder that families are the same the world over.  Photographs capture the ups and downs of life ... joyful weddings, the awe of new life, the struggle of living, and the sorrow of death. We have continued to give this book as a wedding gift ... as a new family begins 
 Least we have forgotten, Colin Powell's autobiography reminds us why American is still one of the greatest countries to live in, especially if you are an immigrant. And, how if we work hard, stick to our values we can achieve the great American dream like Powell did.  It was with great reluctance that my husband parted with his copy of this book. I literally had to pry the copy away from him to read. My husband has been deeply influence by Powell's optimism and hard work and often quotes one of Powell's statement, "optimism is a force multiplier."  I had listened to the audio version of the book, and wanted a chance to read it.  Powell's American Journey has been mimicked by many people, who have have found great fulfillment and happiness in the US. In this book, Powell shares in a candid manner how his hard-working immigrant parents helped him go to a school where he was an average student, and how his stint in the army helped shape him and his future.   This book is an inspirational one, and reminds us how we can achieve our dreams if we set our goals and heart to it.  The book is also about leadership, and what it takes to become a leader. Leaders are often made, and not born and this is clear in Powell's case. No one would have imagined that an average immigrant boy from Harlem would rise to become an important cabinet member in the US 
    Daniel Deronda was the final novel authored by George Eliot (1819-1881) whose real name was Mary Ann Evans. In this novel Eliot tells the story of two intriguing fictional characters: Gwendolyn Harleth-egocentric, spoiled and rich husband hunting young lady noted for her beauty, wit and charm. Her marriage to the older aristocrat Grandcourt proves disastrous. Gwendolyn emerges at the end of this 800 page three-decker as a more mature person eager to live and grow. Daniel Deronda is a young man raised as an English Protestant who has a mysterious past. During the novel he learns of his Jewish blood; becomes a good friend of Mordecai the prophetic voice of the Jewish hope for a homeland in the Middle East.  Daniel falls in love with Mordecai's singing sister Mirah.   The novel is slow moving. Today it would have undergone editing to reduce its numerous pages. It is a work which is sympathetic to the beginnings of Zionism and has a postive view of the Jews. All of this in a nineteenth century society which was very Anti- Semitic.    George Eliot is more interested in the human mind and its many labyrinthal peregrinations from youth to maturity. She is a forerunner of writers like Henry James who explores what underlies the surface behavior of fictional characters.    Eliot did not have the widescope of Dickens nor the practical relation of cold facts as did Trollope. She did have a massive intellect who told serious stories for thinking adults.    She is one of my favorite writers who is well worth knowing 
 If you want the best biography ever written on Smith,this is the one.No punches pulled or apologies.And it is readable,is it ever you'll have trouble putting it down cause it reads like a novel,not like a choppy biography,and even better the story is true.Smith comes off as a circus barker promoting the greatest show on earth,that is "his own".Brodie mentions strongly that with Smith's family's penchant for seeking treasures in the earth,quests for lost pirate's gold etc. the book of Mormon may have been an attempt to create a bestseller in colonial times. Hence the Book of Mormon may have been a cult classic that became so big people believed it to be true.This is not entirely unplausable seeing that Poe was able to manufacture a ballon travel hoax at the same time that the general public believed to be true. Brodie has written a classic and it was written 50 years ago.i particularly liked the picture of the Canopic Jars used by the Egyptians for storing mummified organs.According to Smith's telepathic interpretation these jars are representations of biblical beings.No mention of organs.Caught red-handed in a speculation presented as a pronounced truth. It's like the adage of the cockroach in the restaurant,see one and you know for sure there's alot of others.(misreps that is in this case).Then every other page as the book progresses later on someone is being denounced who 3 pages earlier was proclaimed a saint.(How can this be)?The big draw for Smiths followers as i see it from reading this book was free land and a fresh start in the American west for working paupers of old Europe and the new world.Security and family first. Theology? well maybe later.If Brodie writes like this all the time then I'll be looking for more books by this author.By the way I was turned on to this book by an Amazon reader!I read the new Bushman book but it was too sanitized and when there are only a limited number of primary sources available any omissions can present a completely different portrait in a biography.If you can only read one book on Smith,and want an accurate picture this is the one.I would like to see more info in a biography about Smith regarding the Great Awakening period in American History(1830's),apparently religious fervency was heightened by an expectancy of the "final times".Stump speakers were a dime a dozen,rising and disappearing equally as fast.I get the feeling it must have been amusing hearing those preachers barking their condemnations with the animation of a circus carney.Smith was THE MASTER,pulling off his own Greatest Show on Earth,complete with a book and an organization, still intact when he was assasinated.After reading Brodie you would have to conclude that Smith was either a prophet or a sophisticated,calculating,charlottan,who may have slighty miscalculated in regard to himself, but he couldn't be both 
 This collection of stories from Zimbabwe and Botswana is fun to read and yields insight into the storytelling culture of southern Africa. I've already re-told several of the stories to friends, who have enjoyed them. (Two favorites are the first story, about a guinea fowl who becomes the child of a childless woman; and one about a turtle farmer and a snail trader whose friendship falls upon hard times.)  These stories would be wonderful to read aloud to children, and in addition to the suspense and action of the stories, the distinctness from most American stories is interesting: animals turn into people and trees grow out of a man's head, all without explanation. Whereas American stories would have to attribute these events to magic (or wacky science), the folk magic here is assumed. These stories also have strong morals, from the superficial (Don't reject your daughter, even if she's smelly) to the more fundamental (People who trick others out of money pay in the end).  I heartily recommend the audio version of this book, which has several excellent readers including Lisette Lecat (who reads the audio versions of The Ladies' Number One Detective Agency books and Alexandra Fuller's books) 
 In my view the best Renaissance album. It all came together here, Annie Haslem's voice is on top form and the mix of folk rock and the orchestral backdrop works perfectly (and that is some feat if you consider how difficlt it has been to mix the two - aside perhaps the strings on Nick Drake's releases).  Turn of the Cards provides the band with two of it's finest efforts in Running Hard (glorious piano intro) and Mother Russia. I also like 'I think of You' with some great harpsichord supporting Annie's vocal.  Renaissance belong to a vintage crop of British bands including Fairport Convention, Wishbone ash and Pentangle. The question is are they still recording?   
 I received this very quickly, I watched it and it was excellent quality..  DVDs are definately the way to watch TV shows...  A definate spoiler. 
 Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques  As our characters enter in to the second half of the Tribulation, Satan takes possession of Carpathia, as predicted in the book of Revelations. It took forever in the book for it to actually happen though. The book picks up right at the end of #6, Assassins, where Carpathia is killed, and the entire scope of book 7 encompasses not much more than three days.   As followers stream in from all over the world for Carpathia's over-the-top funeral, his closest advisors try to figure out who killed Carpathia. The authors will take readers on quite a trail as they try to guess who really did it. I figured it out almost immediately, but it was interesting to follow the different threads throughout hinting at different possibilities.   However, it seemed a long book to get through three days if you ask me, but I'll keep reading. I've gone too far to stop now! 
 when i first listened to this cd, i really didnt find a lot of great songs, except for plane crash, happy hour hero, and definitely nebraska. However, when i ran through the cd again, it was awesome. At first i wasnt  really a big fan of queen of the rodeo, but after hearing it the second or  third time, it was awesome. Same thing with stranger than fiction. there  probably isnt one bad song on the cd. definitely a good buy 
 "a truly great early study of Vietnam" is what I said in my first review; the two stars were for the publisher - as we now have access to the battle area and actual NVA participants. In the spirit of Were Were  Soldiers Once.. I'd have wished for more....but I do realize that spending  weeks in Vietnam was infeasible.. JM 
 Touchdown Pass is the first of 23 Chip Hilton sports novels.  Originally published in 1948, it retains much of the homey goodness of that era.  While this first in the series is about fottball, in the subsequent 22 novels, Chip and his chums take on basketball and baseball.  This is a quaint adventure, intended for children but a pleasant read and reread for fans of all ages.  The author was also a famous basketball coach of the fifties, also author to many non-fiction books on basketball techniques and coaching 
 Once again Michael Connelly proves he is top shelf when it comes to Crime Drama. I was first introduced to Connelly, like many; via the 2002 Clint Eastwood pseudo-flop "Blood Work". I had no desire to see another creation of Connelly whatsoever. A year later I was at a book signing for one of John Sandford's "Prey" books and he recommended I give Connelly another try. I picked up "The Poet" and that was all I needed. I can sum it up like this: No one writes flawed and F'ed up characters like Connelly. No one!  Others have given you enough plot points of this book so I will skip that. I will say in "Echo Park", Harry Bosch is on top of his game (and to be honest, when has he not been??). Among other things, we are teased with another classic confrontation between Harry and his nemesis, former Deputy Chief Irving. Alas, it was not to be, but I can see a clash between these titans just over the horizon. Can you see it??? I know that you can.  We are treated to the usual cast of characters including a special FBI agent from Harry's recent past as well as his partner, Kiz Ryder and others from the Open/Unsolved Unit. We are also reminded what a tool Jerry Edgar is. God is he useless.  You cannot go wrong with a Michael Connelly book. Trust me, pick it up today. 
 Toolan gives us a complete theoretical toolbox that, indeed, contains some sharp tools with which to analyze literary narratives.  It's a good introduction, and as is mentioned early on, it's both linguistic and critical.  The critical aspect is the book's strength: the author neatly summarizes past research (ranging quite broadly) and argues within the linguistic field in order to set up his own complex position on each aspect of narratology.  The reader leaves with a sense of depth and sophistication - Genette, Bal, Halliday are all given due treatment.  In particular, the treatment of Genette is so skillfully done that readers of the French critic may well find themselves reaching, instead, for Toolan in the future 
 Jacobs starts with the claim that there would be no agriculture if there were no cities, confronting the general "agriculture first then cities" approach. She then explains how new work is added to the economy. She states that division of labour is needed for economic efficiency, but does not promote further economic activity. Thus, efficiency of operation is in conflict with development of new work. Jacobs suggests that cities grow by gradual diversification of its economy, starting from its initial exports. Local economy grows as the exports grow, and many imports are replaced by local products. More goods, raw materials and services become available to the producers. Although this is a very comprehensible book, it includes a degree of redundancy. Must be in a planner's library, and should be read 
 As an occupational therapy student currently assigned to a physical dysfunction site, I have found this text to be the most valuable.  I advise any student taking the NBCOT exam or begining a affilitation in physical dysfunction to purchase this text! 
 A FRIEND RECOMMENDED TONY HILLERMAN AS SHE KNEW I READ MANY MYSTERY BOOKS. I BECAME ADDICTED TO HIS WRITING AFTER THE FIRST BOOK.  I NOW HAVE COPIES OF ALL HIS BOOKS PLUS A MAP OF THE TERRITORY IN WHICH THE STORIES TAKE PLACE. IF YOU LIKE MYSTERIES WITH A SLIGHT TWIST AND A REASONABLE ENDING, YOU WILL ENJOY ANY OF THE HILLERMAN BOOKS.  
 What is the greatest superhero team of all time?  It's debatable, but certainly it comes down to an elite few:  The Justice League is the best team in the DC Universe, but Marvel has a number of groups to choose from.  If it's a matter of brains, I would go with the Fantastic Four, but for sheer muscle, I would go with Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers.  The Avengers are the Marvel equivalent of the Justice League, featuring the all-stars who aren't already affiliated with other teams.  Volume 5 of the Essential Avengers series covers issues 98 to 119 (with one Daredevil and four Defenders to make sure certain stories are complete).  The core lineup in this period include most of the big names in the group:  Hawkeye, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Vision and the Scarlet Witch.  The only "classic" Avengers who are missing are the Wasp and her husband (Ant Man/Yellowjacket/Giant Man/Goliath).  Also appearing are the Black Panther, Black Knight, Hulk, Swordsman and Mantis.  Since these are the elite heroes, they rarely battle third-rate villains.  In these issues, they face such heavyweights as Ares, the Grim Reaper, Magneto, Dormammu, Loki and the Collector.  In between battles, the principal story arcs involve the three members who don't have their own magazines.  For the Vision and Scarlet Witch, they are finally admitting their love for each other, with all the problems an android/human relationship entail.  For Hawkeye - who has his own designs on Wanda rebuffed - this leads to alienation from the team and a brief membership with the Defenders.  While most of the stories are pretty good, some are a bit on the weak side.  Surprisingly, this also includes a single-issue story by Harlan Ellison, who is normally one of the best short story writers around.  But even if the quality is occasionally erratic, overall this is another fun volume that once again evokes a somewhat simpler era of comic book tales. 
 This was my heating pad, but my hairless cat took it over. He has a special pet heating pad of his own that he loved until he discovered this one. The first day I couldn't pry him off.   I love that it's washable. In fact, I'm getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash. Of course, I keep it pretty low for him. Being able to choose the times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff in two hours and some days that's not enough. 
 This is a surprising relationship between an upwardly mobile, 27-year-old advertising executive and a 43-year-old waitress who works at a hamburger joint. What begins as a drunken seduction moves on to sexual obsession for both parties. Susan Sarandon gives a top drawer performance as Nora, a boozy redneck survivor whose heroine is none other than the self destructive Marilyn Monroe. James Spader is perfectly cast as Max Baron, a compulsively neat and sexually repressed widower who is brought back to the land of the living by Nora's erotic ministrations. Eileen Brennan does wonders with the minor role of Noras' sister, a fortune-teller. Luis Mandoski's direction of White Palace makes it into a convincing psychodrama about the redemptive power of love which can even overcome deep-seated class differences.   
 When I was little, this book sat on my bookshelf for I don't know how long. It was too long, too natural-sy looking and seemed too boring for me to read for a long time. When I did read it, it became part of me but I could never guess at how important it would become to me until some twenty years later.  A couple of years ago I decided to write an honours thesis in my chosen area of English Literature. And what was the most valuable book I'd ever read and that was more worthy of academic study than any other? A Girl of the Limberlost. It is the flagship book for my studies in American nature writing. Although  I'm currently journeying through all the big guns - Thoreau. Whitman, Abbey etc., none as yet hold a candle to the Limberlost, an intriguing mix of swampland and some of the tallest timber in the United States. Admittedly, the plot is trite, the ending disappointing, the characters slightly unbelievable, but there is something that lifts this book above its own flaws and I really think that's the nature writing sequences. And the way people are incorporated into that nature.  It's also the deeply rooted sense of Americana in the story. From the descriptions of food and clothes to the long, unsealed roads, I think this book is the best introduction for young female readers into American ethics, style and enterprise in the early twentieth-century. It certainly gave me, an Australian, a taste of Americana which has proved more useful and comforting than I could have ever imagined. I recommend it without reserve for any reader, but particularly young girls. I just wish I could remember who gave it to me. I'd love to say thanks 
 In Harm's Way by Doug Stanton is a hard-to-put-down telling about the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, the battleship that carried "Little Boy," the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. After their delivery was completed, the Indianpolis set out for their next assignment and, through a series of miscommunications and break-downs along the upper chain of naval command, was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine and sunk almost immediately afterwards. The survivors were left in life vests and rafts in shark infested water for almost five days afterwards, found only by chance by an eagle-eyed pilot flying on a survey mission. Nobody in the Navy even realized the ship was missing until the ragged band of survivors was found! Of the ship's original complement of 1277, only 317 survived. The remainder either died immediately when the ship sunk, or died waiting for rescue, with up to 200 of them being killed by sharks. This is a story of true courage, of ordinary men who became heroes, who refused to let the men around them die. While not dwelling on the graphic details of the horror, Stanton conveys the circumstances very realistically through the words of the survivors. My heart goes out to all the men who were on the Indianapolis, those who died and those who survived. And I have the deepest admiration for the men who became the leaders, no matter what their rank, and pulled together to keep 317 people alive for five days in hostile water until rescue came. If anyone is looking for heroes, this is the book to read.   
 I bought this book when I went to hear ZZ Packer speak at a writing convention.  Until then, I hadn't heard of her, but her speech, which was titled something like, "How writing can make a difference," really enticed me to buy it.  Make no mistake, Packer's fiction is vivid and enervating.  Rather than being formulaic or banal, her stories draw compelling pictures of her characters' lives.  From Dina starving in Japan in "Geese" to holly-roller Doris who confronts endemic racism in "Doris is Coming" to a misanthrope Dina who can't abandon her hardened shell in "Drinking Coffee Elsewhere," Packer has abundant understanding and compassion toward her characters.  These stories are beautiful works of art, and open-ended enough that one feels as though these are living, breathing people who will continue living and breathing.  Unlike so many authors, Packer allows us joint-custody for these characters' futures, which only makes them more honest and convincing.  I never got her to sign my book, but the chance to read it is enough for me 
 Kenneth C Davis presents an unvarnished look at the history of America from Columbus to mid-2002. His viewpoint incorporates modern scholarship and sensibilities and avoids the traditional oatmeal that America is always right and good, but not in a particularly accusatory or condemning way. For example, it exposes Jackson, Sherman, and others for their mistreatment of the Indians but doesn't actually condemn them. It explains Washington and Jefferson's ownership of slaves without apologizing for them.  That said, Davis makes some of the traditional mistakes, such as mistaking presidential politics for history, treating peace as just the uneventful time between wars, and focusing on meaningless scandals (his conclusion after a long discourse on Jefferson and Sally Hemmings? "We don't know.") Davis fails to address the rise of high technology any more than the rise of heavy industry. There's not one word about developments that define modern American culture: cinema, rock-and-roll, suburban sprawl, e-mail, and so on.  Still, Davis addresses the major events we all learn about in school but forget the details of and does so in an engaging and meaningful way. A note to audiophiles: I listened to the unabridged version on CD and found the frequent lengthy timelines to be hard to follow, especially since the narrator doesn't reiterate the year for each event 
 ITS YOUR CLASSIC BAD GUY GOOD GUY - GOOD GUY SAVES GIRL.  THE major thumbs down about this movie was the "room mates" and the excess use of gutter language at times. What makes this a GOOD movie though is its realistic presentation of issues.  I find that the honesty between the characters personalities drove the storyline and made for an overall interesting movie with a sarcastic overtone about the worlds rejection of truth, purity and innocence, both displayed in the Professer and the "room mates".Also worthy of note is the confusion the misplaced "MAIDEN IN DISTRESS" suffers from.Which leaves the masculine viewer completly relating to the "Loser" who is clearly the hero of the story.  This would be a good movie to preach from. Leaving out comments made in the movie for SURE but by mainly pointing out the situations and CONSEQUENCES of substance abuse,the possible compromises that can be made all in the name of the $, amoung other youth issues also portrayed in the movie.  IF ANYTHING enjoy the movie, recieve its warm humor and FEEL driven to support the under dog or all round nice guy next time you meet one. WILD AT HEART indeed!  GS 
 I initially checked this book out at the library, and after reading it, decided to buy it for my bookshelf. It is a fascinating read. The author gives insight into known, classic works of literature and authors, and uses these insights to address issues writers need to think about. It is written in an accessible style, well organized, and engrossing. Even for non-writers, people who love to read, this book is on my "100 Books To Read Before I Die" list!  The book contains a bibliography of all the works mentioned in the course of the various chapters, providing a few more for the above mentioned list.  "Reading like a writer" is a great resource for readers and potential writers who wish to understand the process of writing.  Highly recommended 
 Hugh Jackman is so handsome, and Ashley Judd is so funny, you will love this movie 
 This short, illustrated book provides a compact and useful introduction to tropical fish commonly kept in aquarium tanks.  The book goes into detail of how to set up a tank, how to maintain it, and what fish to put into it.  The book comes complete with color pictures of the various fish, their characteristics and the challenges of keeping them in an aquarium tank.  The book itself is quite inexpensive, and worth the cost and time to read it 
 Excellent service and very speedy delivery. Will purchase again from Amazon. Thank you 
 Robert Munsch is one of the all time best children's authors. I enjoy reading his books to my kindergarten class.  They love to hear how silly his books are 
 I enjoyed this book immensely and now look forward to reading more from Holzer about this period.  It answered so many questions I had about the messy circumstances surrounding slavery and the formation of the country.  What I had always thought of as such hypocrisy was, as I now understand it, an incredible lesson in the human tension between reality and ideals -- such a Christian tension and so true to life, and on such a grand and significant scale.  Rather than merely acknowledging the "stain", as indeed it was, the focus today should be on the triumph of overcoming it.    In his highly detailed telling, Holzer over and over exposes Linclon myths surrounding the event and that are, in themselves so revealing of human tendencies.  While deflating so many of these myths, in the doing he does so much to explain the likely origins -- often humourous, sometimes self serving, but always understandable and enriching to his story.     And not just myths.  One I found particularly poignant was repeated on occasion by son Robert who was at Exeter at the time of the speech.  While it had been only about 4 months since they had seen each other, a visit to Robert was one of Lincoln's excuses for taking the time and incurring the expense of going East to speak.  Lincoln ultimately made about 10 subsequent stops to speak in New England on his return trip to and from Exeter before heading home.  While these speeches laid the foundation for his calculating father's ultimate nomination and election, Robert steadfastly maintained the purpose of the trip was to see him.  I found that very touching -- it's one thing to be a father to your country, but still another to be so to your son.   At the heart of it all was the speech itself and the eager ears, eventually eyes, which took it in.  While Lincoln's personality was a factor, the power of his words was what carried he day.  I found this revealing and a tonic to today's politics -- an altogether different America then.   This was democracy at its best.  There is clearly, to me at least, no ideal political system, as all can be manipulated.  Now with Hamas the victors in Palestine, I guess even the current administration might be thinking this.   I could go on, but won't other than to quote the following recollection attributed to Lincoln and which might best be read with the thought of current schooling in mind:   I remember how, when a mere child, I used to get irritated when any body talked to me in a way I could not understand.  I don't think I ever got angry at anything else in my life . . . I can remember going to my little bedroom, after hearing the neighbors talk of an evening with my father, and spending no small part of the night walking up and down, and trying to make out what was the exact meaning of some of their, to me, dark sayings.  I could not sleep, though I often tried to, when I got on such a hunt after an idea, until I had caught it; and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied until I had repeated it over and over, until I had put it in language plain enough, as I thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend.  This was a kind of passion with me, and it has stuck by me; for I am never easy now, when I am handling a thought, till I have bounded it North, and bounded it South, and bounded it East, and bounded it West.  Perhaps that accounts for the characteristic you observe in my speeches, though I never put the two things together before.   PS   As a graduate of Cooper Union, I did find Holzer's account of Cooper's amazing building a bit thin.  Plans and photos are available on the web.  The stage is on the West, not the North as Holzer says, and there are 18 obstructing columns, not 16.  These inaccuracies have not altered my faith in his account.  I have inserted a plan of the hall in my copy.  
 This is definetly one of my favorite books! I've read it countless times and I also love the sequel 'Far Traveler'. The characters are all lovable and the plot is excellent. Another great thing about this book is it is partially a historical fiction novel. The author Rebecca Tingle wrote this book wrote this looking at historical notes. AEthelflaed was a real person and did many great things. Enough great things to be known as Lady of the Mercians.   Flaed is a girl that's only lived fifteen winters but her father King Alfred is making her marry a man named Ethelred of Mercia...a man that she's never met... He's also many years older than her. But Flaed must agree and her father tells her that she cannot be left alone any longer. She must have a bodyguard...a man named Red.   While Flaed and Red are together Red teachers her many things on how to defend herself. She learns how to ride faster and better (which will let her show off to her future husband soon), she uses the sword and many other things. But little does Flaed know that when she leaves for her new home trouble will follow.  
 Since I'm in my forties and just bought a digital piano to learn and play music for the first time in my life, I thought it would be interesting to read this book for some tips and inspiration.  I did, however, find it quite difficult to get into.  Perhaps this is partly because I am not American and also because I don't know much about either the places the author mentions or most of the names he drops.  But I persevered, and am glad I did, because although I didn't get what I expected I did enjoy reading about the experiences of going to a music camp and the authors encounters, conversations and interviews with various amateur and professional musicians.  These were the best part for me, and especially to explore what making music means 
 I sent this book for "silent reading" with my 7 year old to school.  She's supposed to do 30 minutes a day.  I was shocked when I picked her up and she was on page 80!  I asked how she did that.  Well, she found the book so engaging she took it to lunch, PE and read in between doing other work.  She left it in her school desk and was screaming and running back to class to get it so she could finish it.  I check out a LOT of library books but have yet to see something like this before.  I think the reviewer who pegged it as a great first chapter book is correct.  There are a lot of pictures which young kids still like, short easy to read pages and of course a wonderful engaging story.  You can't miss with this book 
 This disc set contains two spectacular games, Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger. Both of the games are wonderful. I have played every version of Final Fantasy IV, the Japanese version fan translated, the English version on the SNES and the remade version on the PSX. I loved all three versions. Final Fantasy IV's storyline is great. The plot starts right away. The storylien is gripping and it makes you feel a lot of symphathy for the characters. All of the characters have well developed personalities and this game has a quest for redemotion It shows that people can change. When Cecil is in a situation where he must choose honor and dignity versus the life he knew- he makes a decision that will change his life forever. He goes against everything he learned to do the right thing, what his conscience tells him and embarks on a quest for redemption. When he becomes a new person, the other characters are developed, and his relationship with his lover and his companions are delved into. The storyline is great- a wonderful love story and a great tale 
 Will Ferrell was a giant in the recent history of SNL and none of the contemporary male cast come close, in my opinion.  I've only seen volume 2 of this collection, which I thought was a little flat in places maybe, but overall was of a very high quality.  There's nobody does angry or outraged like Ferrell, and the evidence is there for all to see in the sketches where he is an office manager (with Pierce Brosnan) or a patriotic office worker (with the bloke from American Pie). He is such a great physical comedian, he really throws himself into these parts 100% so that it is truly invigorating to watch.  The disc also contains a couple of interviews with Conan (the Irish one in particular being very funny) and some sketeches that never got aired.  I think these SNL DVDs could maybe be a bit better value for money, since you only get an hour and a half of material at best, but because they are all divided into sketches it helps for flipping through the disc to get to where you want. It's the kind of disc you can view over and over again, so I recommend it. I have no doubt Volume 1 is better, but vol 2 is a pretty decent substitue 
 I have been interested in reading something by Grisham for quite a while, but I was recently "pushed" to actually read one of his books when I saw the movie version of "A Time to Kill". The obvious book to start with was "A Time to Kill". I had heard that Grisham is good, and I really enjoyed the movie, so I was expecting a lot. I was not disappointed. This book brings out some very interesting ideas about murder and the justification for it. It also gave a very large amount of information about the legal system in general and trials in particular. This legal iformation was probably my favorite part. Throughout the book, I found myself thinking through how I would try to convince the jury to free Carl Lee. The book was obviously "prejudiced" in that it was written from the aspect of Carl Lee having adequate reason to murder the two rapists, but even so, there is a lot of material having to do with proving that.  Overall, this book isn't perfect, but its problems are relatively minor and do not detract from the book. The entire book flows rather smoothly and it really keeps you intrigued. I highly recommend this book, as well as others by Grisham. I will be reading more of his books soon. Also, I would recommend the book "The Sacrifice" by Robert Whitlow. It is a very intriguing legal thriller that is somewhat similar in style to Grisham's writing. I just finished reading it earlier today and it is great. Read and enjoy

 This is the famous book that got Galileo in trouble with the Inquisition. Galileo Galilei was one of the greatest scientists of all time. In Galileo's time the all powerful Catholic Church had decreed  that the Earth was  at the center of the Universe and that all celestial bodies orbited the Earth. The reasons given for this were Theological in nature, not scientific. According to the Church the Earth was a special place in the Universe, because God had chosen the Earth to be Man's home.  By the sixteenth century  Science had progressed to the point where this view of the Universe became increasingly untenable as it did not agree with observations about planetary motion.  To resolve the difficulties created by these observations Copernicus had published from  his deathbed a new theory proposing that the planets moved around the Sun in nearly circular orbits. Copernicus theory seemed to agree much better with what was known at the time about planetary motion. Galileo being perhaps the greatest scientist of his time immediately saw that the Copernican theory must be right, and debated the matter with people holding the opposite view at the University where he was a renowned professor, Mathematician and Scientist. For a while debates, arguments and counterarguments followed, until in July 1609 Galileo found the definitive proof that the Copernican theory was right. The story has been recounted in the "Starry Messenger" by Galileo. He had seen a toy sold by a Flemish spectacle maker in Venice which made distant objects look like they were near. Galileo bought the toy and did not rest until he had figured out how it worked. He then turned the toy into a scientific instrument, and the first telescope was born. Galileo soon turned his invention towards the heavens, and he almost immediately made a number of groundbreaking discoveries. When he observed Jupiter he noticed that Jupiter had Moons just like the Earth had, and by observing the Moons of Jupiter and  Jupiter on successive nights he soon discovered that the Moons of Jupiter clearly orbited Jupiter,  not the Earth, as they were supposed to by the Ptolomaic theory taught by the Church.  This was the definitive proof that the Ptolomaic theory was just plain wrong. He started to teach this but trouble soon ensued. Galileo had been ordered by the Church that he could not discuss the Copernican theory  except as a Hypothesis. When Pope Urban VIII became the Pope Galileo was greatly encouraged, because as Cardinal Maffeo Barberini prior to being elected Pope Urban VIII, he had been a great admirer of Galileo. When the new Pope was elected, Galileo had an interview with  him and  was told that he could teach the Copernican theory, but only as a Hypothesis, and he  was not allowed to teach it as the "objective truth". In 1632 Galileo published  this great book in which he debated the two systems between three protagonists. One of them called Simplicio (roughly simple-minded) was defending the Ptolomaic Theory and two others called Salviati and Sagredo defended the Copernican view. All the various arguments that had been offered by Simplicio for the Ptolomaic theory were demolished  skillfully one by one by the clever Salviati and Sagredo. Unfortunately Urban VIII got furious, because some of his own arguments ended up in the mouth of Simplicio. He felt that Galileo had made a fool of him, and so he ordered the Inquisition to summon Galileo and he was tried and convicted of Heresy. Galileo protested that he followed the injunction he had been given, and only taught the Theory as a Hypothesis, but the Inquisition's powerful judges did not accept his argument and convicted him. He was placed  under house arrest at his own home, and was forced under the threat of being burned alive, to renounce his theories, which he did. His book was banned, but it was too late. It had already become a best seller, and it soon would be published in translation in foreign lands where the Pope had no power. Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems thus changed History. It has also  great relevance to today's World.  The religious fanatics of today behave much the same way as the Inquisition had in Galileo's time. They bring forth Theological arguments where science is called for. An example of this is the debate about Darwin's theory of Evolution and natural Selection, the basis for most of modern Biology. In spite of absolutely overwhelming scientific evidence in favor of Darwin, ignorant people today  still try to discredit Darwin's Theory on essentially Theological not scientific grounds.  Evidently, just like the people opposing Galileo who did not succedd, similarly the ignorant Inquisitors of today will not succed. Another example in the modern World are the attempts of the  Islamic fascists, who like the Inquisitors in Galileo's time try to force  their despicable religious agenda on others by imposition and violence. They will not succeed either, for in the end Reason and  Science always prevail.  
 If you are young, under 30, this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex.  If you are older, this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned (or things that you missed) in the school of everyday life.  For both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others. 
 This is one of those books that is almost impossible to categorize.  It's part natural history, part autobiographical, and part training log of a world class ultramarathoner who set a master's record over two decades ago that still stands. It covers a wide breadth of biological research into animal and human locomotion in an attempt to explain what the author claims in an innate human nature to run.  I found the writing to be first rate at times.  For a scientist, Heinrch can really write, and certain parts of the book took on a lyrical quality.  Other parts unfortunately came across as an uneventful day in biology class.  When Heinrich recounts various times of his life, he passion shows.  Many of the chapters on animal and biological location are quite interesting, but a few are bit tedious to get through.  The book ends with Heinrich documenting his training and motivations for a 100 kilo Meter race in Chicago in 1981.  There is a building expectation as his training comes together, and a certain thrill in his description of the race and what he had to go through to achieve the highest level of his sport.  I found the various attempts to train his energy pathways by altering his diet and purposely exhausting certain energy stores in his body quite interesting, and advanced for his time.    A slight problem I had with the book is that Heinrich considers the drive to run an innate human characteristic.  While this drive to run is certainly true of Heinrich, I didn't entirely buy that all humans share this trait, that may well be more a characteristic of Heinrich's and like minded individuals psychology than of general human biology.   
 Revolution, aliens, young love; hot stuff to a teener.  Uncle Bob at his political, inventive best (this tale includes the first literary description of "stealth" vehicles,,,decades prior to their actual construction in "our" world) 
 I have a 30 gig iPod and this leather case fits great!  All of the openings are in the right place, the protective stitching surrounding the case offers extra protection against accidents, and the belt clip/ear pod wrap is awesome!  I kept getting my ear pod line tangled, but not anymore.  By the way, it looks sharp too!  Definitly a great value.  Highly recommended 
 Compiled, arranged, and edited by David Cannadine (Director of the Intitute for Historical Research at the University of London and editor of the scholarly journals, "Historical Research" and "Reviews in History", What Is History Now? provides the reader with erudite, well reasoned appraisals of what religious, social, political, cultural, gender, intellectual, and imperial histories are defined to be, in the modern day. Collected from lectures presented during a two-day symposium at the Institute of Historical Research in London, What Is History Now? is a crucial discussion especially for historians and educators seeking to establish a solid, baseline from which to study and teach. 
 I found this book in the local used bookstore.  One of the ladies suggested it to me.  I liked the lack of "typical" book structure and the meandering of writing.  It was at time difficult to read, and really there was no resolution, but that is life.  Our problems don't all go away by the end of the book or movie.  It felt real.  I felt for all the characters and their hardships, even the unlikeable ones 
 This is a great book for those interested in knowing the career of Balenciaga.Marie Andre Jouvre had already written a larger edition on the topic, a book callled "Balenciaga", published in 1988. She shows she really understands what she is talking about.What I liked most about  this book is that it gives a general overview of the work of this master,  including some  high quality pictures of his most famous dresses.And for  those who really prefer pictures, this is the book for you. The written  part is really small, yet effective 
 Great stuff! From a time when experimentation and creativity were accepted. Listen to the production on this Wow 
 This book is the ideal introduction to the thought of Mikhail Bakhtin. Bakhtin is becoming established as one of the giants of 20th century literary criticsm, despite his work being unknown in the West until the 1970's. This book is less about Dostoyevsky per se, rather a profound meditation on how Dostoyevsky's art exemplifies the central concern of Bakhtin, the concept of 'dialogism'. This idea defies a simple definition; the book in exploring manifold aspects of it, itself becomes truly dialogic. If you value Dostoyevsky as an artist, require an antidote to the chill winds of modern 'Theory', or simply appreciate genius at work, catch up with one of the best kept secrets in literatur 
 I was quite worried after reading The Color of Magic that I had just spent all that time enjoying myself, but I knew that book #2 would be a let down and so I'd be okay and I could get back to work and/or literature or at least wasting time on shock wave games.   The Light Fantastic (book #2) I'm horrified to say was even funnier than The Color Of Magic (book #1), and there are 30+ books in the series. If the progression of humor is any where near linear, I may be in actual physical danger. I could asphyxiate from laughing long before I reach the end.  I may have to get one of those bracelets. 
 This is the catchiest, most memorable set of tunes yet from Matthew Adam Hart, but I do wish he'd stop burying his vocals so deep in the mix. That's the only complaint I have here -- and with previous Russian Futurists releases as well 
 This book most definitely pleases as it contains the same elements as the original which make you fall in love with it. Orczy can write both action and romance - and you don't get so much action that it overshadows the storyline, and not so much romance that you think you'll be sick to your stomach.  I can't wait to read the rest... 
 This is a sort of Star Trk book that makes you really think! It is about the kind of Klingons you never see any more. Not the smooth-headed ones from the original series, and not the ones from Next Gen and DS9 either. But the ones with the single anterior ridge and the canine fangs, the ones you see on the first ST movie. Their society and their home planet were different, but their customs especially the sense of honor is similar to the modern ones. In this story a young Klingon, Vrenn, is 10 years old and beginning his military career. Yes, this race of Kingons has a short lifespan and grows up as quick as we saw Alexander grow up. And Vrenn quickly becomes captain of his own ship and is sent on an important mission. You'l be surprised at who the villians are in this story! Let's just say it is a very unusual ST tale! I would give 10 stars if I could 
         "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" is as good a book as any regarding a Beginner's interest in  Zen meditation and the proposition of improving one's consciousness.      The text's chapter's are categorized according to  (1) Right Practice (2)Right Attitude (3)Right Understanding.      The enigma of Zen meditation is that it has become so popularized in Western culture that people have come to characterize anything weird or odd as "zenny".   Moreover,  other  irrelevant baggage is accrued by the many books on art or other endeavours who employ Zen in their titles  as a marketing gimmick.  This further complicates  popular understandings as to what Zen either is or isn't.        Therefore,  it is appropriate that  author Shunryu Suzuki  targets the subject of "Mind Weeds," from which I quote briefly:     "That everything is included within your mind is the essence of mind.  To experience this is to have religious feeling." --p. 35     and also:     ""Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble.   You yourself make the waves in your mind.  If you leave your mind as it is,  it will become calm.  This mind is called big mind."--35        The reader will find himself captivated and excited by the author's insight and teaching,  and will begin probably to see the world and self in an entirely different perspective.                                  
 +++++  This extremely well researched book, by historian Edward Chancellor, is about the history of financial or stock market speculation.  The line distinguishing investment, financial speculation, and even gambling is not absolutely clear:  "[S]peculation is the name given to a failed investment and...investment is the name given to a successful speculation...The psychologies of speculation and gambling are almost indistinguishable: both are dangerously addictive habits which involve an appeal to fortune, and often [are] accompanied by delusional behavior and are dependent on success for the control of emotions."     The title of this book "Devil take the Hindmost" comes from a phrase in the 1720 writing of an "anonymous pamphleteer."  This phrase means "Let every person follow self-interest, leaving others to fare as they may."  Chancellor takes us through significant periods of stock market manias or "speculative manias or  bubbles."  Some examples include:  (1) the Dutch Tulip Mania of 1637 (2) the British South Sea Company Bubble of 1720 (3) the U.S. bull market of the 1920s (4) the U.S. bull market of the 1980s (5) the Japanese Bubble Economy of the late 1980s.  All of the above events have one thing in common: the mania is always followed by a collapse, or more eloquently, the bubble eventually bursts.  But as you read this book, you will discover that investors and speculators don't seem to learn from the lessons of the past.  Why?  Because as Sir John Templeton stated, there is this manic belief that "this time it's different."  Throughout this book, you'll come across words such as these:  mania or euphoria, bubble, crash or collapse, suicide, lotteries, gambling, speculation, irrationality, political influence, corruption, fraud, bankruptcies, bank failures, greed, profit, wealth, power, illness, anxiety, nervous breakdown, insider trading, capitalists, materialism, risk, murder, debt, and market manipulation.  Chancellor also provides other interesting historical information in his narrative besides just historical information about speculation.  For example, he tells us the true story of where the stock market terms "bull" and "bear" came from and what Mark Twain thought about investing and speculation.  Contrary to belief, this book is not biased.  In the epilogue of his book, Chancellor tells us the benefits that come from speculation.  However, from reading the initial chapters of this book, it seems to me that these benefits come at a very high human cost.  The only problem I had with this book is the plethora of footnotes.  They occur on every second page or so.  While some of the information in these were very interesting, I found that I got tired of being continually distracted by these footnotes and so I eventually gave up reading them.  Although not completely necessary, it would be helpful to know some basics about the stock market and investment when reading this book.  Chancellor does a good job explaining most things but he also assumes that the reader knows some basics.  Finally, this is a unique book that thoroughly explains the history of financial speculation.  Whether you're an investor or not, you'll learn a lot especially about human nature.  RECOMENDATION: Invest in this book!!  (first published 1999; preface;  9 chapters; epilogue; notes; references, acknowledgements; index)    +++++ 
 Not just "there I was in a whiteout" stories, although those are in there.  The sixteen pieces represent attempts on Everest back to the Twenties when Mallory disappeared.  They are in chronological order, which is helpful because many of the writers refer to past history in their work.  All but three are excerpts, but as always, carefully chosen so that you enter and exit the work without feeling confused.  There are selections about the early exploration of Everest and then a detailed third-person account of the first ascent in 1953.  Geoff Tabin writes about the dynamics of an expedition and the labor that goes into making even an unseccessful assualt on the mountain.  Willis puts an interesting spin on the idea of "survival" by including two interesting accounts - one explaining why the previously strong bond between Messner and Habeler didn't "survive" after their 1978 triumph without oxygen, and a first person account by Maria Coffey, who after losing Joe Tasker to the mountain traveled ther with Peter Boardman's widow to find closure for her own "survival".  And there are the epics: Venables' near fatal overnight bivouac on the mountain, Anatoli Boukreev's rebuttal of "Into Thin Air", which cast him in a poor light, an account from Lene Gammelgaard, a less-known participant who nearly died that brutal night in 1996, and my favorite - an emotional yet self-effacing first-person story of that same disaster by Michael Groom, one of the guides, who reflects not only on his own near-death, but the helplessness of a guide who could not save his clients: it was he (among others) who walked away from Beck Weathers and left him for dead.  So all in all a great read on many aspects of Everests history, and if mountaineering gets your blood going, don't overlook the earlier series volumes"Epic", "High", and "Climb", all packed with riveting tales of death and survival from mountains around the world 
 You'll never meet a more unique character than Jimmy Porter, a 20-something British Archie Bunker.  He's filled with rage at the absence of ... something ... and spews forth venom, sarcasm and utter misery  relentlessly.  Sounds horrible, right?  Well, it's fascinating.  I couldn't  put it down, and I'd like to see the current revival of the play in NYC.   I've seen a few people like Jimmy Porter, people who have so much  potential, energy and creativity, yet for one reason or another it's all  squandered.  They fail to surround themselves with people of equal passion,  and the result is that they hurt the ones around them, who are more at  peace with themselves.  The question is, how does someone so young get this  way 
 As a criminal defense attorney, my clients freedom often rests on my ability to understand the technical aspects of a case.  While I will seldom, if ever, know more than the "expert" opposing me,  understanding the topic in a straight forward and simple manner makes my  interaction with that expert a benefit to my client.  This to the point of  knowing when not to say anything.  This book provides a one-stop resource  for all aspects of firearms, gunshot wounds, and the related forensic  techniques and methods.  A must for anyone who needs to understand, in  plain language, the issues that come into play in gunshot injury and  firearm cases.  The photographs, x-rays, and diagrams provide an excellent  point of reference for the text 
 I'm at patjobe@chesnet.net if you want to react to my review. Madaleine brought together many ideas and beliefs in a highly readable, presentable way. After you read her book, read the books she has read, or better yet, just start letting the oneness flow through you. She is talking about real stuff that really works and can literally make dreams come true. I'm not there yet, but I've read the book twice and it is a gem of not only how to get there, but how to be there now. It works 
 The tendency over time (and even while it's happening) is to strip history down to a series of simplistic events and convenient anecdotes. I've never been able to understand why this happens as most people seem to make the heaving and ho-ing of forces and stresses within their own heavily rationalized lives far more complicated than, say, the bewildering complexities that lead up to the start of the Second World War. Listen to any Leftist spout the minimalist canon about Viet Nam or Iraq and then listen to them go on for hours about all the reasons--social, psychological, neurochemical, personal historical--why they can't, for instance, quit smoking. It's loads of fun.  [Author's note: for funsies go on to any Left-winger you know about how Rome and Carthage went to war years ago over oil. They'll grapple for a while with a word they've never heard before (Carthage) but nod eagerly over the oil explanation. Then, to be extra wicked, explain that it was baby oil they fought over and the evil Carthaginians (they treated women and minorities terribly, that's what made them evil) made it from REAL BABIES. Important: make it clear that the Carthaginians were white and patriarchal so you aren't accused of hate speech! If this is done with a straight face and with serious tone it'll be swallowed in one gulp. I know, I've done it]  What the author does here is pull back the curtain a bit on all the machinations and plots surging to and fro in the world prior to WWI. Did you know the Japanese--generally fairly friendly to us--were very interested in establishing a naval base in Mexico? You see we were always their only rivals in the Pacific--that's why the Great White Fleet stopped in by for a visit and a muscle flex. Then there's Kaiser Bill, a guy who idolized our Teddy Roosevelt, plotting away to trip us up and maybe even carve us up. Things like that. After a read of this type one gets a better sense of why the US was so hot-to-trot over an American canal in Panama, why we wanted a base in the Phillipines, and so on. You see, back then, like now, the world was a den of wolves and backstabbers. Between 1900 and 1920 the US could have easily, and without doin' nuthin' much, gone to war with any major or minor power. We nearly went to war with Germany over Venezuela. Gee, I wish it was all as uncomplicated as so many make it out to be.  
 Summer has come to her small Smokey Mountains town of Hansonville, North Carolina and local resident Raine Stockton finds herself so busy she doesn't have a chance to relax.  Her kennel business is booming with more people coming in for dog training lessons and her part time job in the forest service keeps her so busy she doesn't have time to think.  Raine has loved two men in her life; radical environmentalist Andy Fontana and the man she married Deputy Sheriff Buck Lawson.  Andy has been on the run for close to fifteen years after he was linked to a bombing of a petrochemical plant that killed four people.  The FBI believe that he went on to commit other acts costing more lives and they also think he is coming back home to dig up millions of dollars in diamonds he buried in the mountains to fund a mid-east terrorist organization.  Raine doesn't want to believe Andy is capable of any act of violence. The FBI and Homeland Security are sure he is trying to see her so the authorities ask her to tell them if she meets with him. Raine needs to know if the man she once loved is capable of the acts he is accused of.  If she meets with him, she will get her answers even if they aren't to her liking.  Donna Ball has created one of the most delightful heroines ever to grease the pages of a mystery book.  She is funny, loyal, stubborn and endearing.  Although she isn't living with her husband, readers will not believe that they will divorce.  Readers get a real taste of what living in a small town mountain town is like.  RAPID FIRE is a fantastic down home charming mystery.  Harriet Klausner   
 If you just want a good, quick yarn, in a historic setting, but not too long ago, Parnassus will do the trick. I bought a beat-up, very old and soiled copy of Parnassus on Wheels from the outside bin of a used book store. I was attracted by the title alone. It's the story of how the retiring owner of a turn-of-the-century horse-drawn bookmobile persuades a dutiful author's sister to step away from her housekeeping life to be a countryside book peddler. Adventure and romance ensues. I read it in one afternoon. It is not Henry Esmond, Middlemarch or any of my other epic favorites, but I can't seem to forget it, and recommend it to friends whenever I get a chance. It was just a pleasure to read. It's a splendid little gift to yourself 
 This collection has the best collection of Kenny Loggins' hits, but should they have gotten a better picture of him for the album cover?  I know it's from the '70s, but it looked like he hadn't shaved his face in 3-4 weeks! They should have taken a recent photo of him.  But my favorites are on here, like This is It, his Loggins and Messina hits, his '80s soundtrack hits like Footloose, Nobody's Fool, I'm Alright, Meet Me Half Way, and his wonderful duet with Stevie Nicks, Whenever I Call You Friend. Danger Zone really gets me charged up with its loud heavy guitars and rumbling techno keyboards within the verses. While his albums had stalled in the '90s, my favorite from that period to now is For the First Time. A personal favorite that I still think is overlooked a lot is I'm Free (Heaven Help The Man), which WQOK of Columbia, South Carolina was the only station to play it a lot in summer 1984 while Footloose was a massive hit. Another personal favorite is the rocking, ballistic Vox Humana from 1985. Loggins really got better as a solo artist and songwriter and I noticed his artistic growth through a 10-year period of the '80s. It's what led to a numerous string of gold, platinum and multi-platinum hits.  He made and still makes wonderful pop songs and he's one of the best at his craft. 
 We always watch Monk on tv and buy them when we can for future enjoyment . We love the savings from Amozon which helps us since we are retired now .It is best of two worlds Monk and popcorn anytime we wish  
 magnificent piece of rock n'roll from 81, a year full of new wave synth crap (not all but, yeah you get the point). This is blues-rock-psychobilly drawn into deep american roots mixed with punk-new wave feel, just like Cramps were doing at the time but in my opinion, Guyn Club gone a bit further. Sometimes when you listen to them you can picture White Stripes, sometimes Jo Spencer Blues Explosion. In 81! Totally ahead of their time. A must have 
 I got this book yesterday from a friend and I have only just read the introduction and T.D Jakes described me and the story of my life in a few sentences - It was amazing! I know I am going to love this book; for this book was wirtten for me...and it contains important messages tailor-made for me...So I suggest that you get this book too and it will speak directly to you too 
 I have the other books of Paula's and this is like the cherry on the sundae.  It compliments the other books and is just like her - fantastic.  Have only had this book a short time so have only tried 3-4 recipes so far.  Each one has been delicious and easy to put together.  If you like Paula's show, you'll love this book.  
 She got me again.  I can never figure out who the bad guy is!  This is a great book and I highly recommend it 
 You won't regret the time or money spent on this book. Just read it. AFTER you've read the book, watch the movie. Robin Williams is a master. There's not much more I can say, because once you experience this tale for yourself, you won't need someone else's words to describe it 
 If you've ever purchased one of those "How To" books that seemed to raise more questions than provide answers, you'll be pleasantly surprised with "Raising More Money with Newsletters."  I found it easy to tranfer the author's suggetions and techniques directly from the pages of his book to my print and Web-based donor newsletters.  The book covers all aspects of a publication -- starting with why do a donor newsletter right through to execution.  He has great ideas and suggestions to significantly improve the readability of a publication.  And, he provides the information in an easy-to-read book that will stay on my shelf as a reference.  The author also attacks common mistakes (he calls them Fatal Flaws) that most of us make yet, perhaps because we're too close to our own work, we somehow overlook (especially headlines).  This "How To" book is actually worth the money!

 If you are open to it, your healing will begin just by reading this book.  Chunyi Lin shares his incredible life story filled with terror and pain to show how Spring Forest Qigong was eventually created.  This book was written from his heart to share with his readers a way for them to experience and develop their own healing gift.  The basic meditation and exercises that he thoroughly explains are easy to grasp and simple to do.  The testimonials included instill confidence that anyone can learn and practice Spring Forest Qigong and experience incredible healing!   Above all, Chunyi Lin teaches that learning Qigong technique is important but that the most important aspect of healing comes from the energy of love, kindness and forgiveness.  I love this book.  It is a treasure not to be missed.   
 After getting into PKD's work, Sutin's biography is an excellent companion.  Sure wish Citadel would reissue it 
 Nirvana meets Uncle Tupelo is the best way I can describe this CD.  It represents a remarkable improvement over their (very good) first CD.  The disc definitely is more representative of the live show than that one as well.  Excellent mix and production by one of the members of Slobberbone.  Great in-your-face guitars and growling vocals.  Every track is good, but the standouts are "Alphabet City", "135" and the opener, "My Concern".  I can't imagine anyone who is a fan of rock or alt.country music not liking this CD.  Go see them live at any cost! 
 the songs are different than the previous albums. the vocals of Ian Gillan are modernized and he sounds very different than any other old songs we already have heard in the old classic Purple albums.  the band seems to change their music style drastically today. The hard hitting guitar-riff, drum beat and bass are typical old Purple musical tradition which integrate directly to the new fashion lyrics or songs.  check out the new songs like Back to black, money talks, rapture of the deep, wrong man, before the time began, junkyard blues are different than the older songs we knew. 
 The picture of the blueberry cake on the front of this cookbook attracted me to take a closer look, and I wasn't at all disappointed with my purchase!  My Complete Cooking Light Cookbook has taken up residence on my kitchen counter, and I call upon it several times a week for main courses, snacks, side dishes, and desserts.  Most recently, I enjoyed the Korean-Style Flank Steak with a dessert of almond biscotti.  My family has enjoyed the meals I have prepared from this book - unlike my experiences with many cookbooks, I have run into very few "duds" in this book.  The book is carefully organized and appetizing full-color illustrations decorate its pages.  The recipes are easy to follow, generally not too difficult to prepare, and involve ingredients that are (mostly) accessible in my corner grocery store.  As in the Cooking Light magazine, nutritional information is provided for every recipe.  This cookbook is a wonderful addition to any recipe collection 
 Every major culture has used sound and music not only for enjoyment, but also for spiritual celebration, enlightenment and healing. The mantra tradition of India is the most sophisticated of all. Over all the centuries that mantras have been performed and used, I wonder if they have ever been produced more beautifully.  I have not met Deva Premal and her partner Miten, but having listened to their CDs over the last few years, I feel as if I know them. For they are far more than highly gifted musicians, everything that they produce is suffused with deep love and profound spiritual awareness.   You can most certainly listen to this extraordinary work for enjoyment, but if you let it in, it will soon have profound positive effects on you. When Deva Premal sings, you are listening not just to her physical voice, but to the subtle and causal dimensions of her being. And if you let them, your own subtle and causal bodies will respond.  This is much more than beautiful music: it can guide and carry you toward emotional and spiritual healing and awakening 
 We've been reading this to our little guy since he was three months old, if even that, and he was glued to it from the start, easily his favorite book, still, at nearly 13 months. Great color, great rhythm, and lots of fun bugs! : 
 This is book #2 in the In Death Series. Once again Homicide Lt. Eve Dallas is trying to solve another serial murder in New York in the year 2058.  Her new romance with multi billionaire Irishman Roarke is tested when his name is linked with the victims. Roarke and Eve are very complex characters with a lot of issues from their past.  The more you learn the more you love.  This is another excellent book and once you finish it you will want to move on to the next. 
 David Aaker's  writing style, in addition to the content, is exceptional.  I feel as if I am in one of his UC  classes.   This is the closest I will get to that.  I live in Chicago! 
 Read this book...seriously, it is a great story.  It's so astonishing how DS can take us into a world we know nothing about and at the end of the book, we feel like we've left our home.  You can't put it down.  You can't stop the feelings you will get when reading.. 
 A must-buy for all finance majors studying in college. As a university student majoring in accounting and finance, I found this book to be the most insightful, understandable and practical finance book I've ever read. It can be used as a reference to other important finance books out there like the famous Brealy & Myers book "Principles of Corporate Finance" 
 Mr. Melancon's years of experience provide excellent insight into the world of how executive positions are filled in the private sector. He gives his readers the tools to successfully plan, develop, and execute their efforts to make a career change at the upper rungs of the coorporate ladder. His advice is both timeless and insightful while punctuated with sometimes comical real life examples of how not following it can be disasterous to ones efforts to move up to the next level.  It is definitely a must read for individuals looking to make a positve change in their corporate lives 
 I will admit first that I sped through the last 50 pages, as I was getting a little bored with the story by then, since I already knew how it would end. But for the other 90 percent of the book I found truly fascinating and a great read!  I had no problems understanding which events and themes were real and which were fiction.  I was suprised that the author could be so sure that the marriage between Catalina and Arthur was in fact consumated, but I didn't take her word for it anyway.  The blend of fact, fiction, and assumption is what makes historical novels so wonderful.   Catalina/Katherine's battle to understand whether she was to despise/destroy or accept those of different faiths was especially interesting to me, and it seemed especially relevant right now, as Muslims, Christians, and Jews fight once again based age old prejudices and differences. There are some great parrallels to current events that I could not help but to see. Of course, I don't know how the author could possibly know if this was something that Catalina often pondered, but I thought it was a brilliant tie-in for the story. 
 "I don't claim that the Life-Purpose System is based upon conventional science or even logic; I can't rationally explain how people's seemingly arbitrary dates of birth on the Gregorian calendar could possible reveal valid, reliable information about their life purpose. I only know, with certainty based on years of empirical testing, that the system works-that it can bring lives into focus." - From the book  In The Life You Were Born to Live: A Guide to Finding Your Life Purpose, author Dan Millman explains an intriguing system based on the numerical reduction of your birth date. Instead of traditional numerological meanings, however, Millman applies a unique system that he learned from oral tradition. The key to the Life-Purpose system is determining and interpreting birth numbers, unlocking a path to personal transformation.  There are many systems of personality typing in both psychological and spiritual traditions. According to Millman, these systems only generate the *impulse* to change. However, the Life-Purpose System actually provides the *means* of doing so, especially in light of the universal spiritual laws that he shares in the second part of the book.  There are nine different soul paths thirty-seven possible numbers for the twentieth century. If these nine paths were colors, says Millman, then the variations show the different hues within that type. For example, I'm a 25/7, but other variations of 7 energy include 16/7, 34/7, and 43/7. All 7's share the same key issues, but the "flavors" differ slightly, as do the universal spiritual laws that provide leverage to change your life.  The Life You Were Born to Live outlines the meaning of component digits, understanding life purpose, working each path positively and negatively, and likely health issues. Millman gives an overview of relationship strengths and pitfalls for each soul path, as well as talents, work, and finances. Designed to deepen self-understanding, the author provides useful question, recommendations, and the appropriate spiritual laws affecting each path. The book also highlights famous people for each numerical variation. Millman then takes over 70 pages describing seventeen Laws of Spirit that aid in transformation.  Although this 447-page book has been around for a while, I recently came across The Life You Were Born to Live at an opportune time. Feeling my customary existential angst that hits every few months-"why am I here, anyway?"-I did a simple 3-card Tarot reading that confirmed what I had learned from another personality system (Ansir). Nothing new to me, ironically. After wondering aimlessly in a large bookstore, I picked up this book and turned to my soul path numbers. Everything I already knew was there and much more, confirming the wisdom I received from the Tarot. Nevertheless, there was something about *this* time that made the crucial information (finally) stick. It's all about trusting self and personal intuition for my particular life path-and I finally "got it".  I had a major shift in the bookstore just from a brief reading about my unique combination of numbers. It wasn't until a later visit that I actually purchased the book. That cursory reading was all I needed, though-and I'm grateful. While the section on the Laws of Spirit may be helpful for many, there weren't the most important aspects for my own search even though they were certainly applicable.   The description of my son's numerical energy was uncanny. At 7 years old, I have actually *heard* my son use a phrase that Millman describes as being a hallmark of my son's type!   For those interested in finding out why they're here (and really, who isn't but the most unconscious?), The Life You Were Born to Live is an intriguing personalized system that not only gives you surprising insights into your motivations, personality, and challenges but also practical tools for navigating your soul path for spiritual fulfillment. 
 Twenty Years After is the highly successful sequel to The Three Musketeers.  Alexandre Dumas did not take the easy route and simply regroup his daring musketeers, D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and send them on another adventure.  Remarkably, he ratcheted the time period forward twenty years, aging his characters accordingly.  The seemingly inseparable musketeers have moved along different paths and D'Artagnan has not seen his friends for many years.  For many chapters Dumas leaves the reader unsure whether these four erstwhile companions can put aside their differences - Aramis and Athos are engaged in a conspiracy diametrically opposed to D'Artagnan's interests - and come together in a new undertaking on behalf of the Queen.  The twenty year gap was not just a whim on Alexandre Dumas' part. Cardinal Richelieu died in 1642 and Louis XIII in 1643. His son, Louis XIV, was only five. The Queen was named Regent and selected Mazarin as her key advisor.  Mazarin, by continuing Richelieu's policy of consolidating royal power, angered many elements of French society, ranging from the semiautonomous nobility to the popular masses.  Mazarin's unpopularity ultimately resulted in two separate civil revolts, the first and second Fronde. The first Fronde (1648) is the setting for Twenty Years After.  Despite the twenty year gap, there are many similarities with The Three Musketeers.  The older musketeers are no less adventuresome, no less courageous, and no less awesome in combat. The musketeers again become embroiled in court intrigues, including a cross channel adventure in England in which they assist Charles I against Cromwell. In perhaps his most audacious step, Dumas introduces Mordaunt, the revengeful son of Milady.  Surprisingly, this fictional addition proves quite effective, and contributes significantly to the suspense and drama of Twenty Years After.    Upon completion of this entertaining sequel, I again wondered why there had been no mention of D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in my history classes.  In my view French history is far less interesting without these intrepid adventurers.  Recommendation: I highly recommend the relatively inexpensive Oxford World's Classics edition of Twenty Years After, especially for its valuable supplementary material. In particular, I found the editor's explanatory notes - includes many references to earlier events in The Three Musketeers as well as short historical descriptions of the many, many characters that appear in this long novel - to be exceedingly helpful 
 I have read many long, complex books on studying and study tips.  Soon after using the complicated methods, I stumbled across this book.  It was refreshingly simple and effective without any sort of complicated methods.  A good reminder for the overwhelmed 
 Washington and Arnold - not usually names put in the same sentence, but after reading Dave Palmer's work one can only imagine that, with a twist or two of fate, our history books may have featured a President Benedict Arnold.  Palmer does a nice job of running Washington and Arnold's stories in parellel.  The two were much alike - at least on the battlefield - both men of action.  Washington, however, was better at dealing with intrigue and attacks than Arnold.  In the end, Arnold's personality quirks did him in.  Too, bad because he was a natural leader.  Reading A Tale of Two Patriots, I was hoping the end would change and Arnold would remain a true patriot.  But, history is history and the tale ends sadly 
 When i firsted listened to it i put it away and didn't both with putting it on again untill i ripped it to a mp3 cd for the car and now that it has grown on me it has become one regular tunes for my ears. looiking at there other cd's it's still not the best but if you do like some of there Songs then it's still a good buy 
 I cannot heap enough praises on this book.  Bravo! This book is an English edition of a transliteration into latin letters of the Popul Vuh: the sacred religious and wisdom text of the Maya.  It was studied by Mayan leaders, and recited aloud to the people.  Everyone knew the stories.  In the original books, there were many glosses, anecdotes and images elaborating upon the text; and in this English edition, the author has provided us with just these same sorts of things, including beautiful mysterious Mayan art on nearly every page.  I absolutely love Mayan civilization's artwork, architecture, script and it's greatest story; they appeal to me profoundly on a deep aesthetic level.  Mayan civilization seemingly had so much mystery and excitement.  They even had stadiums where thay watched sporting contests!  This book opens up this whole civilization to us and allows us to get intimate with it.  And, for those of us living in the Americas, this is the greatest work of literature of our greatest ancient civilization!!!  It's human value is inestimable; and it still contains lots of wisdom for us, if we are willing to learn from it.  It was the book of kings, and now it is ours 
 I PERSONALLY FOUND THE BOOK TO BE VERY USEFUL AND INFORMATIVE.  IT WAS EASY TO USE AND IT WILL ALLOW ANYONE, YES EVEN SOME ONE WHO HAS NEVER WRITTEN A LEGAL DOCUMENT BEFORE, TO MAKE THERE OWN IN NO TIME AT ALL.  i  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO BE A DEST REFERENCE FOR LEGAL SECRETARIES JUST  STARTING OUT AND TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS A DOCUMENT AND WOULD LIKE TO DO IT  THERE SELF 
 We read this aloud as a family, and read it in record time because no one ever wanted to stop.  "Can we have one more chapter PLEASE?!?!?!"  My son (age 7 1/2) liked that Humphrey made lots of friends and we all liked how he took vocabulary tests.  My daughter (age 10) liked how they use hamster language, like squeak instead of speak.    Humphrey's a smart little creature.  If he can keep a journal, maybe a kid can too! I liked the way Humphrey helped us understand why certain people might behave the way they do.  Humphrey's character is portrayed with more depth and dimension than most books' human characters. Skillfully yet simply told.     The  extras at the back of the book are a neat bonus as well: puzzles, riddles, Humphrey trivia quizzes, and more.  We were delighted to discover today, looking at the author's website, that there's another Humphrey book now.  We can't wait to read it. 
 With this I dont need to have an I podand the price is great too 
 Nathan Falk, "Matches" protagonist, is binational, an Israeli army veteran and a citizen of America and Israel. When Alan Kaufman's novel opens, Nathan is serving in a reserve unit of combat-trained Israeli infantry. He had already served two years in the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), and as a reservist was frequently asked what brought him to "this insane mess?" Why join the army if he didn't have to? An American by birth, Falk feels he had lived pretending to himself that non-Jews really didn't think he was a "Christ-killing, world-dominating, media-controlling k*ke..." But he was always aware of an "ice-cold separateness." "They never let you forget not so much that you were a Jew but that they....were not." Nathan strongly believes that the only place in the world he can be free of this baggage is in Israel. Toward the end of the novel, an army general expresses, yet again, his surprise that an educated American, "who knows Auden and Yeats," would volunteer for the Israeli armed services. Falk replies that he loves the Jewish State and would do anything to keep it alive. "Because loving it is like loving myself." Then he reverts to dark humor as a way of chiding himself for sounding sappy and sentimental. However, he notes that the general is moved by his heartfelt statement.  Kaufman attempts to provide here an evenhanded account of an Israeli soldier's life at the front and to reflect the enormous human toll the seemingly never-ending Palestinian-Israeli conflict takes on everyone it touches. Although many might say, (and I am sure they will do so), that no one can be objective or unbiased about this horrendous situation that saps energy and hope and breeds hatred and terror on both sides, I think the author does a superb job of bringing the realities of the war into the reader's living rooms. His perspective is much broader than one would think or expect. In an up close and personal, in-your-face kind of way, we accompany Nathan Falk as he navigates his schizophrenic world - the intricate maze of his personal civilian life and that of his military reservist tours of duty. Falk is a wonderful character - absolutely three-dimensional and very likeable, although his life away from the front lines, in Jerusalem where he is a member of an artistic, intellectual circle and the lover of his best friend's wife, may call his morality into question. His heart and mind are in the right place though. Bottom line - he is a decent, thoughtful man.  Kaufman also draws extraordinary portraits of those who people our protagonist's life: Brandt, the squad leader with the looks and sex appeal of a movie star; Avi, a Moroccan-born Jew who drives a taxi in civilian life; Sergeant Dedi, whom the men would follow anywhere, has "the darkstaring focus of a Ninja tenth-degree black belt." He is an art student when not leading death defying patrols; Bachshi, the Bedouin, the unit's best tracker and  Falk's close friend - or at least "as close as a Bedouin and a Jew can be;" Rami the cook who feeds his men as if he were a Jewish mother; Elchanon the very religious immigrant from Yeman, lives in a settlement which will eventually be turned over to the Palestinians. He and his fellow "moshavniks" believe that "the Israel granted to the Jews in the Torah which stretched from Lebanon to the Euphrates, and all the way to Amman and Damascus, is the Israel that we should have today." He is a fundamentalist who is sure that "After the war against the goyim will come the war between the Jews." If you do not believe as he does, than you are an enemy.  The narrative is permeated with wonderful humor which alleviates the grim reality of being a member of an occupying force trying to prevent lethal suicide bombers from getting through and succeeding in their mission to kill as many innocent civilians as possible. "Matches" is a war novel unlike any I have ever read. The vivid prose moves, informs and disturbs, as well as causes laughter. "Matches," the author tells us, is a term taken from a poem by Hannah Senesh, "'Blessed Is The Match'  - a hymn to valor - and is the IDF code word for a soldier. Among the troops, it has come to mean someone who strikes, burns and dies."  Alan Kaufman is an American who joined the Israeli Defense Forces two decades ago and returned for multiple tours of duty, most recently in 2003. His essay on "The Origin of Matches" at the back of the book is extraordinary. A must read!  I cannot recommend this riveting novel highly enough. Enjoy! JAN 
 Sweetly and simply written in a similar lulling tone as other Margaret Wise Brown books.  Take it for what it is -- a children's book that offers children simple, concrete information that provides them with security and a basic understanding that regardless of how many things define us, there is at least one thing that makes us unique / who we are. And that's a good thing to know and count on. I don't think this book intends to speak to children as if they're brainless and I believe that a young, innocent mind "gets" the message.  Any book that reinforces that the best, most important thing about being you is simply that you are you should be applauded and supported by all of us

 It is adorable, charming and laugh out loud funny. A great read. "Scot on the Rocks" rocked my (literary) world 
 The Washington Post reviewer betrays his own mindset when he allows that Johnson's ALBERT ANGELO to be "an impressive novel, though redolent of 60s experimentalism," in which the word "though" stands out like a red flag.  What does he mean, "though"?  Read the sentence without "though" and it would represent my point of view.  Oh well to each his own.  But I say, what's wrong with 60s experimentalism?  You'd think it was a taint of some kind.  The truth is that Bryan Johnson, ill read and ill served by his publishers (though he couldn't have been easy to handle) is a far more interesting author than Jonathan Coe, no matter how many awards the latter has received.  The whole project had a quixotic tilt for Coe, who seems to have regarded himself very reflexively, for of course he is constantly having to defend his own bourgeois conception of the novel against the avant-garde of Johnson and, say Beckett, and constantly he is shading his generally well thought out exegeses on Johnson's books (a few of which I have not read) by citing their inhuman, formalist coldness, a quality he abhors, a quality that he believes contributes to the "deadness" of experimental writing.  So it's a funny book in many ways, and yet I am grateful to Coe for writing it, for it establishes a context, no matter how skewed, by which he might form a coherent view of BS Johnson's life and times.  And surely we owe him a huge debt of gratitude if only for spending eight years interviewing many souls (and many who have since passed on) who knew Johnson and who otherwise would have let their knowledge go quietly into the grave of experimentalism in England.  It is a rich turf, nearly unknown, terra incognita and nearly untouched by biographers.  All in all, a splendid book, a book you can lose yourself in, and perfect for long winter night 
 Max Hastings acknowledges that armies run not on heroes, but on the average soldier.  The typical troop follows orders, does his or her duty as necessary, and longs for hearth and home.  However, the author claims that armies require a certain number of individuals who go beyond the call of duty.  These standouts are the ones who lead the charges, motivate the troops to go beyond themselves, and actively engage with and destroy the enemy.  They are the Warriors, and they embrace combat in a manner that more gentle folk might consider bloodthirsty and self-serving.  But whatever one may think of them, Warriors are needed to win wars, and Mr. Hastings has provided us with examples of the best.  He has written mini-biographies about fifteen Warriors, ranging from Napoleonic times until the Yom Kippur War.  Some are well known, while others are more obscure.    The author chronicles the Warriors' amazing battlefield deeds, but also analyses their inner motivations and defining experiences.  What emerges are fascinating, if brief, character studies on each Warrior.  I found their contrasts to be quite interesting.  For example, British officer Harry Smith had a lifelong love he met while fighting Napoleon's legions in Spain.  In contrast, WWI scribe Frederic Manning apparently lived a celibate life.  "Humane and intelligent" Civil War hero Joshua Chamberlain was loved by his men, but WWII RAF squadron commander Guy Gibson's harsh mannerisms alienated his subordinates.  Some were successful in and out of combat, while others struggled with civilian life.  WWI flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker was a high achiever in all of his pursuits.  As for WWII hero Audie Murphy, he struggled with inner demons and never really fit into a life without warfare.  And so on.  Each Warrior's contemporary society and formative years are mined for clues about what shaped them.  Family influence and station in life are analyzed, the impact of intellect and education (or lack thereof) is examined, and the effects of combat and wounds on their psychological makeup are investigated.  From this foundation, Mr. Hastings identifies the similarities that possibly made these men (and one woman) stand out from their peers in the art of war.  "Warriors" is a fascinating and well-written tome.  It quickly supplanted other books I was reading, and was difficult to put down.  Indeed, I wish it had been longer.  But Mr. Hastings has provided captivating insights into the Warrior's character and motivation.  Some struggled with life, others were difficult to get along with, and a couple came to tragic ends.  But all inspired me.  Highly recommended for the military history buff 
 I read this book a few years ago and it changed the way I thought about the state's role in influencing culture. This is an excellent read 
 I got this book after I saw the musical.  I wasn't disappointed.  Great story, gripping tale 
 Mary Poppins has been my favorite movie since I first saw it in 1973.  The wonderful music of Disney inspired me to enter a music career.  I've greatly enjoyed the restoration of these great movies and their music over the past ten years or so.  I throughly enjoy the complete score-only feature of "The Sound of Music" dvd and this is the Disney equivalent.  There's no end to the thrill of hearing this wonderful original score, arranded and conducted by Irwin Costal, in it's digitally restored brilliance.  This makes me anxiously await the two disc soundtrack to be released for the film's 40th anniversary. Three cheers to the producers and to Disney for giving this original music the attention it deserves. 
 If you or your loved ones have food allergies..Buy this book. You won't be dissapointed. I was not. I use it as a reference in food trials and ingredient reading. It won't stay on the shelf. This is a book you can use over and over again 
 I like it. It's light in weight and easier to handle. 
 Take a peek into Japanese culture, and be amazed how this ancient text still applies to life today.  You'll also learn a great deal about medieval Japan 
 This "Top Gun" spoof gets mixed emotions for me. Charlie Sheen, Cary Elwes and Lloyd Bridges are definitely the high points of the film, they are hilarious! So is this film, but towards the end during the last battle scene it gets dull. This is supposed to be a comedy, but they leave that for an almost serious battle sequence with just little gags thrown in every now and then. When you are laughing hard most of the time, you notice when the film drags. My personal favorite part is the wall eye vision. Overall, I really did enjoy this movie; it just started to drag a little towards the end, but picks up again right at the en 
 I recommend you get this as it makes a profound difference in your life and perspective.  
 This book, written by Civil War hero Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, is an interesting first person look at his experiences in the war.  While some of his passages are self-serving and do not necessarily reflect what actually happened (e.g., his and the 20th Maine's actions at Little Round Top during the battle at Gettysburg), this is a good rendering of one person's account of his experiences.  The book provides a tour of Chamberlain's part in the War, beginning with his engagement at Fredericksburg, through the violence at Gettysburg, to the battle at Petersburg (where he was badly wounded), to White Oak Road and Five Forks (and his dramatic encounters with the fiery Phil Sheridan), to Appomattox.  The book concludes with the story of the Army of the Potomac's grand review in Washington D. C. after hostilities had ended.  It is written in the style of the times, which seems somewhat overblown and overstylized today.  Nonetheless, it provides one soldier's perspective on the War.  In addition, there are a series of Appendices that flesh out Chamberlain's story (such as his comments at the dedication of the 20th Maine's monument at Gettysburg in 1889, Chamberlain's report on his and the 20th Maine's role at Gettysburg, his rendering of the last salute of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.  The volume ends with a memoriam to Chamberlain upon his death.  All in all, a useful book to gain a sense of the perspective of an important soldier in the Union Army, although flawed to some extent by some self-serving discussion. 
 "Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950's" is the second and last volume of the hardboiled anthology published by the Library of America starting with the volume devoted to the genre in the 30's and 40's. This follow-up continues the saga of run-down characters hardened by experience and tough luck. The familiar cast of roguish males, femme fatales, and temperamental and violent detectives set the stage for a diverse and entertaining ride into the depths of the underworld.  "The Killer Inside Me" - Jim Thompson's most popular work is a memorable tale of a Texas law enforcer with a sinister past whose dark and psychotic nature is cunningly veiled behind a genial facade that barely contains "the sickness" which the main character has successfully concealed. A sudden turn of events unleashes the beast inside leading to a tragic odyssey of disillusion, violence, and murder. Pioneering in it's time for revealing the inner mind of the serial killer, the bracing prose and chilling character development makes this work one of the best in the genre.  "The Talented Mr. Ripley" - Tom Ripley is a con artist successfully making ends meet through one of the most reprehensible professions in New York City. A drifter and social outcast, one night in a bar he comes across a parent of an old acquaintance he barely recalls and is asked to do a favor. When he consents, his true nature unfolds in this story of murder, sexuality, and identity. Made into film in 1999 starring Matt Damon in the leading role, this cosmopolitan travelogue with a Decadent touch in the end introduced the world to one of the most oddly sympathetic and diabolical characters in Literature.  "Pick-Up" - Charles Willeford's winning style successfully conveys the sad and tragic tale of two lost alcoholics in the skid row section of San Francisco in the 1950's. Scene by depressing scene the author chronicles the faith, hope, and disillusionment of a couple whose time revolve around the contents of a bottle. The engrossing prose is marred unfortunately with an unbelievable twist and dissapointing ending.  "Down There" - The best selection of the entire series, "Down There" is an unforgettable account of a barroom piano man whose days of glory were ended by tragedy. Rendered indifferent to life by his soul-breaking experiences, he meets an equally lost soul and together they encounter adversity supporting each other as only similarly dark-fated individuals can. The heartbreaking ending still haunts me whenever I think about it.  "The Real Cool Killers" - Blaxploitation on speed! The talented Chester Himes vividly conjures this adrenaline yarn of two black detectives taking on the streets of Harlem in no holds barred action. Race, violence, and loathsome scenemakers feverishly grapple in this heat-inducing neon nocturne of urban society. Black humor at one of it's very finest.  Flawed but highly readable, these long forgotten and out of print works have been handsomely restored and given ample tribute by the laudable Library of America. Wanting to familiarize myself with the enduring genre, reading the two vols. of the "Crime Novels" series has been a pleasant introduction and reading experience to me 
 This is a 5 star recording, but with several caveats.  I agree with Adam Janson's review- I also know there is additional music around.  It's not hard to go on line and search for a bootleg called "Everybody Here Can Be In The Band."  It has some earlier mixes of songs, and additional jams as well as other songs that didn't make the album.  There is another live bootleg of Crosby and various Dead members called "David And The Dorks" which was a live concert from December 1970.  Why wasn't any of this material used? Also disappointing is the short picture gallery, which doesn't include all the original pictures from the original record sleeve.  And, although a video is listed, there is none. What a sad way to disappoint those of us who consider this to be one of the greatest albums ever released. Buyer- beware.  You're getting less than you deserve, especially at this high price. 
 This is a great "feel good" movie, but Hollywood altered the story for theatricality.  In the film, a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up, in one year, to become calculus winners.  There is a good backgroud article at:  http://reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml  that describes how the process took ten years, so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the AP calculus exam.  Jaime Escalante (played by Edward James Olmos of "Miami Vice" fame) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time, reaching back to the junior high school that fed Garfield High.  The way that the movie was done, however, allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them, especially their parents.  Remarkably, at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under Escalante's leadership.  That's 400 fewer future employees for KFC and MacDonald's.  (As Escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student, "So tough guys don't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living?")  Eventually, it appears that the Education Establishment won out, driving the brilliant teacher out, and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future.  The idea is great, that no student should be regarded as hopeless, and that all should be encouraged to try, but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows.  
 If a novel like Jakes' North And South showed an unrealistic picture of the old south, then this book is its antidote. Slavery and daily life in pre-Civil War times as it surely must have been. Telling his life story as he spends his final days in a Virginia prison waiting to be hanged, Nat Turner reveals to us his secrets and the nature of his mission from God, to free the black race and punish the sins of the white man. Because its violence is kept contained until one final moment at the book's end, it seemed more shocking and visceral to me than tales of mega-death and mayhem so common in other books that chronicle bloodshed and uprising. This novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and it earned it 
 If You Survive is a classic first person account of the Normandy invasion and subsequent battles. Quite frankly, it's not just a good history book but an excellent study in leadership and often found on the recommended reading list for junior military officers.  The title says it all. Just before the invasion George Wilson's commanding officer said, "If you survive, I'll promote you."   I won't spoil the book with an in depth review of all the events. But this remains a very interesting book about the 4th Infantry in Europe during the second world war. It's easy to read, well written and very descriptive. Of the well over 250 books in my WWII history collection this one remains one of my favorites. 
 I really enjoyed reading these stories, especially since it is winter in New England at the moment. This book contains a broad assortment of travel stories--they are all quite amazing. Some are laugh-out-loud funny while others have you petrified for the authors. A beautifully put together book 
 William Buckley, long before Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom noted the crisis in the elite universities, decided to defend the honor of his school. Yale's founders and trustees needed to know that the new class of professors were subverting this institution of higher learning with a perverted form of modern liberalism. Departments and courses were being polluted with faddish social science. Classical learning was being dismantled.  Perverted is too kind a word for what was done to the post-war generation of college students, families paying for them and well-intentioned trustees.  Yale, like other old colleges and universities, had a Christian foundation. Its new and false defenders of "academic freedom" were rushing headlong away from an education that places God in the center and man's soul on trial.  Buckley was a young man with the backbone to take on the false doctors. This was a time when New Deal intellectuals could strut and bask in the afterglow of Roosevelt's policies. For high-flying American liberal, there were no real enemies to the left.  It takes a person of unusual foresight and mettle to call these professors on the jive they were starting to ratchet up on unsuspecting students and parents.  This book should inspire students who wake up and realize when they have professors with Anti-judeo-christian, Blame-America-First agendas 
 If you are thinking about making a passage, then you have an emergency if you haven't purchased and read this book.  I have done some study into the subject of heaving-to and drag devices, having used some and spent some time in heavy weather.  One thing that all books except this one have in common is a lack of serious discussion of heaving-to.  "Heavy Weather Sailling," by Adlard Coles, is interesting but ignores heaving-to.  There are many tactics that can be used in heavy weather, but heaving-to is the one that ultimately works.  The key principle is not easy to see, but obvious once you understand it:  the water in big waves moves up and down, not down wind, and hence running (even with a drag device) is very dangerous, because if you stop surfing, you are moving far faster than the water, and you will crash.     It is also the waves, not the wind, that destroy boats.  Keel boats will heel as far as necessary to unload excessive wind force, unless irresponsibly over canvassed, but it is the breaking waves that pick boats up and drop them on their sides, causing dismasting, collapse of cabin tops, blowing out of portholes, etc.  In "Storm Tactics,"  Lin and Larry Pardey put it all together.  They cover all the above, and more, and give you the science behind heaving to, and the Von Karmann area.  The prose is simple, logical, and unassailable.  These people not only give you the principles behind heaving-to, but they have actually done it, over and over and over again.   This book should represent a revolution for yachts that will help them weather the worst of storms and make more confident passages.  In particular, I recommend the "Question and Answer" section.  In it, Larry and Lin address the concerns of other cruising sailors regarding heaving-to, but especially they go into the reasons why it has taken nearly a century for us to rediscover heaving-to.    The question for passage makers at this point is not "Should I heave to", but rather, "Is my gear in proper shape to weather a bad storm?"   Instead of arguing and wondering whether heaving-to is the right tactic, we need to be setting up our storm trysail so we can get it up quickly in bad weather, and making arrangements so that the sea anchor can be quickly unstowed, deployed, and protected against chafe in the extreme conditions of a typhoon or hurricane.   And, we need to practise these tactics.  Larry and Lin help a lot with this.  One criticism I have of this book is it just needs to be a little bigger.   They spend a lot of pages (necessarily) defending the idea of heaving-to.  This is absolutely necessary, unfortunately.   In the next edition, I would like to see more information and detailed instructions/options about how to stow the gear needed so that it can be quickly and safely deployed, and more information about the sea anchor arrangements.     Yes, there are probably other sources for some of this information, but Lin and Larry are the best authorities, and hearing it from them gives me much more confidence.  If you are still questioning whether these tactics are really as good as they say, then the best thing to do is get out in a moderate gale and try it out.   Fortunately, my boat heaves-to pretty easily in moderate to heavy gale conditions without additonal equipment, and I can vouch for the Von Karman field and the feeling of confidence that comes from being able to use this technique effectively.  For more evidence, read the books, "Once is Enough," and "Because the Horn is There," in that order, by Miles Smeeton.  In the first book, Miles and B. use the technique of running in heavy weather trying to round the horn.  In both tries, they were dismasted, once because they were pooped and flipped by a following sea, and once because they were rolled after they lost control.  At one point they even speculate that another boat that had trouble rounding the horn was probably lost because they were "hove-to."  In the second book, they are trying again, this time with the experience of sailing around the world several times in all kinds of conditions.  This time, they are heaving-to quite a bit. The change is amazing.  You should read Lin and Larry's other books as well.  While they have quite a bit of "travelogue" material, every once in a while these people will casually mention something that will improve your boats (and your!) seaworthiness significantly.  There is nothing like learning from real honest-to-god experienced people.  So, Lin and Larry, good on ya! for sharing your experiences and wisdom with the rest of us.  You are definitely saving lives.  
 The transaction went well. We recieved a good product in the allotted time 
 Reading New Spring was my first adventure in the Wheel of Time Series.  It served the purpose well of an introductory book to a longer story.  Jordan creates quite a realm of magic, history, mystery, and kingdoms.  The strong point of the book is the character development of the two main characters---this interaction between Moraine and Siuan makes the book worthwhile if nothing else does.  New Spring references many past conflicts between forces apparently on sides of good and evil but they are only referenced and not explained.  Little is explained in this book...I can only assume the questions will be answered in future books of the series.  The first chapter of the book focuses on a Warrior-King w/o a kingdom named Lan.  Then, begining with the second chapter until very late in the book, we do not see him again, and Jordan focuses on other characters and scenes, so that when he does return to Lan, I had forgot most of the information about him.    The writing in the book is excellent but sometimes long on descriptions and minituae and short on action.  I am somewhat leery to get too much into this series for fear some of the later books will be stuffed with filler instead of action or instead of wrapping up the entire series. I also wonder if the questions I had in this book are ever answered in future books in the series.  The book does stand on its own, as well as create an interest in continuing in the series---something I hope not to regret 
      My 6 years old daughter was so excited when she saw the heelys box. My surprise was that she start to heel one hour after she open the box.      We are so excited just like her.                         
 The comments or reviews expressed here illustrate how uninformed or misinformed is the general public and deceived "experts."  I refer you all to the PBS documentary and book by Spencer Wells, THE JOURNEY OF MAN.  According Wells, we are all Africans or Kemetians?  We are all descendants from a group of BLACK Africans 300,000 years ago or so. (also see DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S documentary: THE REAL EVE).  If these sources are correct, all languages, cultures, inventions etc. are of an African origin.  Even Queen Elizabeth owes her very existence to her African ancestors.

 We are all taught as little children to make a distinction between two fundamental issues.   #1.   What IS the world like.  #2.   What SHOULD the world be like.   What IS?  What Should be?   They are essentially totally two different questions.     The USA has about two (2) million people in prison.   In an ideal world, the USA should have no one in prison.   Wal-Mart pays low wages.  Wal-Mart should pay wages of $50-$100 per hour.    All peoples should have equal IQ.    False.   The reality is that IQ in distributed in a "natural distribution" in the form of a bell curve.     All races should have equal IQ.  False.    Whites are centered at 100 (one hundred) on IQ test.   Jews and East Asians have generally tested higher than 100.     Blacks and Hispanics have tested around 85 (IQ  eighty-five).   Sub-saharan Africans have tested around 70 (IQ seventy).  That is just the results of decades of IQ testing.  In an ideal world, all races would test equally at IQ 100.  The truth is that different groups test at differently.  True.   We could wish the truth to be different, but the facts are the facts.    IQ is highly critical in all areas of success in life be it on the  job, school, crime, income, ability to reason, think, plan and experiment.    IQ is constant throughout an individual's life.  Inidividuals tested at age 10 will attain same results at age 70.   Researcher have found IQ is highly inherited at about 80%.  It about 80% inherited and 20% cultural.    The facts in the book are not new.  IQ test and IQ results have existed for over a hundred years.  The gap in IQ scores among whites-blacks have been known for over a hundred years.  Anyone who has taken a basic psychology class know about the basic facts of the Bell Curve.  What's the reason for writing or having such a book.  It all about the Truth, the whole truth and nothing but the Truth.  As adults we must accept the world for what IT IS.  We must learn to live in reality.   Many do not like the facts or findings of the Bell Curve, but facts are facts, the Truth is just the Truth.  We should not fear the Truth, hide aways from the Truth and search the Truth as the ultimate goal of all science 
 This actually came as a surprise to me regarding how good this is.  I was enjoying a 3 and 1/2 hour layover at IAH (GB Intercontinental Airport, Houston) and perused through a music store.  I came across Buddha Bar 8 at a listening station, put on the headphones and before I knew it I was swaying to the music.  I think I was putting on quite a show bobbing my head and tapping my fingers and foot.  The music will put you in a good mood.  My favorite is probably the first track, which begins gently but crescendos into a soaring and upbeat melody.  The vocalist is also very expressive, although no distinct words are sung, almost like a vocalise.  I advise you to try this, your heart will soar and your feet will dance 
 Prior to his Pulitzer Prize winning examination of the revolutionary generation in "Founding Brothers," Joseph Ellis tackled the biography of probably the most difficult member, Thomas Jefferson, in "American Sphinx." As Ellis points out in the beginning of the book Jefferson remains one of the most popular founders as well as one that has been adopted across the political spectrum. Ellis sets off to discover what Jefferson's actual beliefs were and how they changed during the course of his life. Rather then presenting a regular biography of Jefferson, the readers are presented with "snapshots" of Jefferson at various times in his life - in 1776 as he is preparing to write the Declaration of Independence, in the 1780s as the first United States minister to France, in the mid-1790s when he returns to Monticello after retiring as Secretary of State, in 1801 at his first inaugural and in the 1810s during his famous correspondence with John Adams. Each "snapshot" is not limited to a specific year but gives a survey of Jefferson's life during the period and how his political thought was evolving.   Ellis's "snapshots" of Jefferson give his biography a unique feel; it is more then just the re-telling of the story of Jefferson's life. Each glimpse of Jefferson that we get gives a feel for not only Jefferson the man, but Jefferson the political thinker as well. Ellis examines Jefferson's frame of mind at the time he wrote the Declaration of Independence and the many different "sources" that may have affected that writing. Ellis not afraid to stay away from the more controversial aspects of Jefferson's thinking - his views on slavery vs. his prose in the Declaration that "all men are created equal" and his affair with Sally Hemmings.   This book is an illuminating biography of an often misunderstood Founding Father. Ellis' unique format gives the book a different feel and still manages to give the reader a greater understanding of Jefferson. Readers who are looking for a more conventional, straightforward biography of Jefferson may come away disappointing. This biography is aimed at readers who already have a background understanding of the early American republic but are interested in unearthing the political ideas of one of its greatest heroes.  
 Just the massive amount of information in the front of the book that teaches you what types of styles look best on your body type is worth buying the book.  I'm not much of a girly-girl, so some of the styles are a bit too foo-foo for my taste, but many of them can be easily adapted to be a simpler design.  Having a voice for us big girls out there in the knitting world is awesome and I appreciate the efforts of the authors very much 
 This product is a God send for those people who have a dog that pulls on the leash and thereby making walking the dog a struggle!  Dogs naturally will tug against restraint.  Former methods of using a choke collar or even worse a harsh coller that will cut into the dogs neck if it pulls are cruel in my opinion as is the method of jerking the dog back if it pulls.  Dogs do not like to have thier heads turned if they pull.  They will IMMEDIATELY stop pulling!  I admit that initially my dogs didn't like the collar over the nose, but that passes quickly.  This is not a muzzle in any way.  It gently and humanely stops the tugging and you will have happy walks!  This product is a blessing!  You will love it 
 Chandler is arguably the best detective story writer out there.  If you expand this genre to all mystery writers, he would still be one of the best.  Detective stories aren't as common as they once were, but if you look at the offspring of the Pulp magazine once so popular, television, they are still as popular as ever.  Chandler was one author who defined what a detective story was.  This book contains four novels:The Lady in the Lake, The Little Sister, The Long Goodbye, and Playback.  These are wonderfully entertaining stories that contain the archetypical hard-bitten detective, Philip Marlowe.  After reading these stories you will forever see Marlowe in every detective story you see or read, from Magnum to the latest TV cop.  How can you not love an author who sums up Modern American Capitalism with lines like these? "We make the finest packages in the world, Mr. Marlowe.  The stuff inside is mostly junk."  Or an author who in the early 50's, (50 years before the current 'Queers Dress Up' shows) so presciently wrote, "The queer is the artistic arbiter of our age, chum." Or his comment on a speech by a politician, "He did not bore us with any facts." These books are not just riveting, fun reading, but full of thoughtful quotes like the above.  Chandler also is must-reading for his understanding of criminality, venality, human nature, Southern California, Movies, American culture and American relationship dynamics.  I hate to use the word "classic" to describe stories that are just so plain fun to read, but I find it hard not to.  This volume also contains a screenplay, Double Indemnity, and a few essays and letters.  The essays "The Simple Art of Murder", and "Writers in Hollywood" should be required reading for anyone interested in 20th century culture, movies, and literature. Just a few tidbits more.  Chandler on English Mystery Writers - "The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers." Chandler on boredom - "There are no dull subjects, only dull minds."  Chandler on critics - "The average critic never recognizes an achievement when it happens.  He explains it after it has become respectable."  My only criticism is that the plots are contrived and sometimes complicated.  But such criticism is like complaining that the Mona Lisa would be a fine painting if only it were of a different size.  Chandler is simply wonderful, funny, cynical, and yes, - respectable. 
 This is a monumental and absorbing collection of 200 brief profiles of the lives of great leaders, highlighting their achievements. More than just a collection biographies, the author has classified each leader into three or more key leadership type categories, such as innovator, motivator or strategist, listing them accordingly in a special index. Each profile is broken down into: 1) name, birth and death dates; 2) leadership categories; 3) achievements; 4) life profile, with emphasis on career; and 5) a bullet list of leadership lessons, plus a few quotations in some instances. The leaders chosen for this immense work are drawn from all areas of life-politics, military, religion-and range across the historical landscape, from Hammurabi and Julius Ceasar to Margaret Thatcher and Colin Powell. We at Stern's Management Review Online find this a gem of a book for anyone who seeks a greater understanding of the nature of successful leadership-or who enjoys gaining insights from the lives of those who have shaped history  
  True, the Baby-Sitters Club is a kid's movie, but it's more entertaining than most of the movies out there today. At least it has a plot, unlike a lot of the junk now. Kristy Thomas (Schuyler Fisk) is enjoying life with her friends and preparing for the BSC summer camp (a camp run by all seven baby-sitters in which kids come all day to do crafts and play games) when, unexpectedly, her dad comes back into her life. Her dad and her mom divorced when she was younger and he's just basically one of those dads that takes off and ventures all over the country while never remembering her birthdays. He wants Kristy to come and spend all her time with him, and he tells her that he's going to move to Stoneybrook soon, but he also intructs her not to mention to her friends that he's there.  So, while Kristy's trying to keep this secret from her friends and family, the close-knit group can't help but noticing the change with Kristy and they start bugging her about what's up with her. Kristy deals with this problem by doing poorly in the summer camp and her baby-sitting priorities, and that starts a rift with the whole Club and even in her family situation. This is basically the main plot of the story, but the other members' stories are what make this movie interesting as well. Stacey McGill, a tall, blond girl who is Club treasurer and also a diabetic, has a new 17-year-old boyfriend from Switzerland named Luka, who doesn't know she's only 14. However, when Luka finds out that Stacey is only 14, he gets mad and takes off, leaving Stacey depressed.  Claudia, the unique Japanese artist and vice-president of the Club, is also confused and worried for both Stacey and Kristy. She comforts Stacey when she's down while trying to figure out what's wrong with Kristy, but sometimes not in the calmest way. Mary Anne, played by Rachel Leigh Cook, is the shy, quiet one who comforts Kristy but finally wants to know what's the deal with her behavior as well. Rachel Leigh Cook was probably the actress that was closest to her character as portrayed by the books. She, besides Stacy, is the only member to have a steady boyfriend, Logan, even though Luka just came into Stacey's life while Logan has been with Mary Anne for a while.   Larisa Oleynik (10 Things I Hate About You), plays sunny California-loving environmentalist Dawn, and Dawn's role is bascially the same as Stacey's, Claudia's, and Mary Anne's, in that she worries about Kristy's problems the whole movie as well. In the series and in this movie, Stacey and Claudia hang out together more, while Kristy and Mary Anne bond better together. This is obvious when Claudia goes to New York with Stacey and Luka, and Kristy and Mary Anne have their own frequent slumber parties. Jessi and Mallory play the supporting roles they always do, best friends, and, unlike all the others, they are 11-year-olds. Jessi is a ballerina whose family suffered persecution in Stoneybrook because their's was one of the few black families, but then she became friends with Mallory and settled down more easily with her family in Stoneybrook. Mallory is a red-headed, curly haired, glasses and braces kind of girl with SEVEN brothers and sisters, and the club used to sit for HER a lot, but when she displayed her responsibilty, they decided to let her join.  In the books and the movie they are Junior Officers, which means they can baby-sit in the day, but not at night unless it's for their own families.  Another person that makes the movie very interesting is the BSC's life-long enemy, Cokie Mason (Marla Sokoloff). Cokie and her posse have been sabotaging the BSC's camp all summer long and it makes for a very entertaining war of pranks and tricks between Cokie and her posse and the BSC. The ending finale with Cokie getting hers is definitely enjoyable and entertaining, although I won't say exactly what happens so as not to spoil the movie. Over all, Kristy's dad leads her on a summer of fun but with the price that she can't tell anyone, so Kristy starts being persecuted by her family and friends because she's "always gone." Finally, Kristy's dad promises her that to celebrate her birthday he will take her to an amusement park and ride coasters with her, but when he doesn't show, it finally occurs to Kristy that her dad hasn't changed in the least and so enfolds a very emotional and depressing scene with her friends becoming worried and concerned when she doesn't show up at her own surprise birthday party that they are throwing for her.  Being the BSC however, they begin a search, and when they find Kristy, they are there to comfort and console her like the true friends they are. All in all, while this particular story never occured in the books, it made for a very entertaining movie amd I thoughly enjoyed it. Rent it with your kids or your family, because it's a nicely touching and thoughtful story.         
 These recordings are stained with the wonder, tragedy, and loveliness of time.  I think, on God's great earth - a world of woe and beauty - there must be nothing finer than to hear a single cello performing from the depths of profound silence music specifically designed to reveal that cello's true nature.  There is something complete and whole in this music that reminds me of a shaft of sunlight stabbing through a window on a lonely afternoon when the spirit of contemplation is in the air. (But I am cursed to identify sound with light and classical music always makes me talk this way.) The Italians have a term *delicatezza* which captures apart of this music, but there is also what could be called a Germanic profoundity in it as if Bach was carrying forth some secret conservation with the sunlight while gazing out on a forest in mid-autumn. I strongly advise my readers to stay away from this music unless they are of a mind to be thoroughly haunted. 
 This is my favourite album of this truly unique ensemble where each member creates his own musical styles and all of them are ideally intertwined in  beautiful aural textures. Most of compositions on "DISTANT HILLS"  belong to Ralph Towner and there are two free improvisations. All members  of OREGON are multiinstrumentalists and the music they play is very rich,  meditative, and eclectic 
 I used this a lot when I was teaching a program called "Peaceful People." Even the very young got the idea about the inportance of listening. I highly rrecommend this book in teaching lessons on listening 
 Bailey birthed the look and this book is chock a block full of it. It's a visual feast with very littly written clutter. A pity that there just wasn't a bit more.. 
 Don and Susan Sanders have captured the essence of the drive-in movie  theatre and packed all of the magic into a really great book. I flipped  hamburgers at the now defunct Belknap Drive-in when I was in high school  and turning the pages of this time-machine brought back many memories.  Forget about multiplex cinemas and theater complexes at the mall. The  American Drive-In movie theatre lives 
 It is 100% cotton narrow and long wash towel. Well constructed but soft. Not really for exfoliating like others 
 This is quite a piece of work. Carbon Glacier had its moments, but this one really takes off - maybe it's the arrangements...sharp, angular, jazzy, with all kinds of weird intrumental fillips...buzzes and bleeps...I'm not usually a fan of this kind of minimalist songwriting, but having said that, I find the song lyrics here to be extremely evocative. Coupling them with her wonderful, deadpan but somehow extremely emotive delivery, one finds oneself inevitably hanging on to every word...  Say hello to an amazing semi-new talent we'll be hearing from for a long time!  Cool water in surround sound, indeed. I'm with you, Laura.. 
 This movie woluld be best for older scooby doo fans. It is a bit spooky compared to most but defintly good.  
 This book is very well written.  It should be required reading in Organizational Behavior and other Management courses 
 If you like Jack OFF Jill, this is a must. Maybe their lightest work but 'tis really a worthy album. They show a lot of maturity in the lyrics compared to their previous releases, actually in my personal opinion this is the most mature album in their history. Songs like Cinnamon Spider, Rabitteen or Vivica are really amazing. Try this ; 
 'Ship of Fools' is the kind of novel that makes the whole thing seem easy.  It's the kind of novel that makes you wonder how and why so many people have gotten it wrong.  Enough with plot buildup, plot developement, plot twists!  Katherine Anne Porter knows the truth about plots and it's this: you don't really need them.  All you need are a handful of meticulously human characters interacting with each other.  Each character seems molded by hand, and each is relatable, lovable, and hatable in their own way, much like the people in our own lives.  I really cannot say enough how much I love this book.  When you're done with it, check out KAP's short story collection 'Pale Horse, Pale Rider.'  She is truly one of our great twentieth century writers, and should be taught in school right next to Hemingway and Fitzgerald, or preferably on top of them 
 Yes, this is better than the runes album, and one of the greatest albums of all time. While Kashmir may recieve a lot of airplay, it is still one of the greatest songs ever. That and the other five tracks on the first disc are worth the price for the double album alone, especially "In My Time Of Dying", which is tied with "Little Wing" by Jimi Hendrix as my favorite song of all time. While the second disc may be a little less consistent, it is still filled with great songs, such as "In The Light" and "Ten Years Gone". Highly recommended for people who like hard rock, classic rock, or anybody who wants to hear some of the best music of all time 
 The norton critical edition was very useful for this novel.  Having all the background about the novel as well as all the footnotes throughout the novel really aided me in my understanding of the novel.  Without the information in these footnotes, the book would not have had the same meaning for me.  The book itself was also very good, although a bit difficult to read.  It was very interesting and it led me to a better understanding of the Victorian era and trials ordinary men at that time had to go through.  A good read. 
 This is a great cookbook for anyone not just the barbeque person it has so many great recipies. I bought it to go along with my copy of Dr. BBQ's other book which he signed for me at a barbeque contest in Arthur Illinoi 
 The album picks up George's career where the boxed set (Strait out of the box) ends, so it covers the period from 1994 to 1998. It shows that George's style was evolving but still firmly rooted in traditional country music.   The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.  The remaining tracks are taken from just four albums, these being Lead on (Adalida, Lead on, You can't make a heart love somebody), Blue clear sky (the title track, Carried away, I can still make it to Cheyenne, King of the mountain), Carrying your love with me (the title track, Round about way, One night at a time, Today my word slipped away) and One step at a time (True, We really shouldn't be doing this). Of these songs, Today my world slipped away is a cover of a Vern Gosdin country hit but the others (as far as I know) are original songs.  Picking out highlights in such a strong collection is difficult, but I'll nominate Murder on Music Row, Adalida, Blue clear sky and King of the mountain. If you are new to George's music, this compilation makes a great introduction 
 Soldat is an entertaining and informative book. This is a WW2 story told from the German perspective which gives us a look into the German mentality at that time. It also makes you realize that not all the Germans were Nazi's and that they felt like they were the good guys fighting for their country. The book follows Siegfried Knappe and everything he went through from before the war to after the war. He was all over Europe during the war he was in France, Italy,Russia and he was there at the fall of Berlin to the Russians. He didn't fight in the front lines because he was an artillery officer but you get to see what it was like behind the frontlines , how all the decisions were made. He was even there in Hitler's bunker at the end of the war. After the war he was sent to a Russian POW camp where he spent a few years. It was interesting to see how the German prisoner's were treated by the Russians. After he was released he went back home and escaped into west Germany 
 This microwave is exactly what I had in mind.  I ordered it on Monday night and it came on Wednesday afternoon!  It also cooks very evenly. 
 From the father of Communicative Action Theory, this book discusses law and politics, exploring how these two interact in the modern idea of a  democracy 
 As a homeschooling mom, this book appeals to all of my children, ages 4-10.  As many of the other reviews have stated, the vocabulary and literary style is excellent, the story is very appealing and the illustrations are simply wonderful.  Amy Timberlake is a captivating story-teller who has warmed our family's hearts and is sure go far in the writing industry.   I look forward to the future writings and illustrations of Ms. Timberlake and Mr. Rex for our homeschool.  One more thing...We have given this book as a gift to a few of our friends - this makes a wonderful gift for families 
 The Race delivers on the promise of an intensely educational and suspenseful read. I learned much more than I expected to about multihull design, sailing history, and the characters involved in circumnavigation adventures, but I was also viscerally "there" during the more stressful parts of the Race itself. Zimmerman provides exceptional context as well as insight into what makes these men and their sailing machines run. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone curious about the quest for speed across the waves 
 An eerie photo of John Lennon signing an autograph in a book, as Mark David Chapman looks on just hours before he would shoot our beloved John dead, is absolutely chilling. Another of Chapman holding his finger to his head like a make believe gun(depicting him as the madman he was),brought back the reality of what happened, made me shiver and lose the smile that accompanied me through this otherwise beautiful look at the beautiful life celebrated cheerily in Life's "Remembering John Lennon: 25 Years Later".   128 pages of wonderful photos, including fabulous shots on both the front and back cover of this must have keepsake for loyal fans. A compilation from the Photojouranlists that were lucky enough to capture and immortalize, Lennon and the Beatles at work and at play.Astrid Kirchherr, Terence Spencer, Robert Whitaker, Bob Gruen, Allan Tannenbaum and Harry Benson's pictures and words tell the story.   There are black and whites, as well as color shots that chronicle and celebrate John's life. Pictures from his childhood, a wonderful shot of the"Quarry Men" at their first gig,his life and loves, family portraits with his children, candid shots with the likes of Elton John and Andy Warhol, and of course the rest of the FAB FOUR, all make for a sentimental look at the treasure we lost.  So, this is not a biography. This is a fabulous photo album, with three main sections. "A Liverpool Lad", "The Fab Four", and "John & Yoko", along with the photojournalists remembrances weaved through the book. My copy is a large(magazine size), softcover of excellent quality , I purchased at my grocery store. It would make a wonderful gift for the Lennon or Beatle fan. Probably would be nice for the coffee table as well, but I think I'll keep my copy in a safe place for now.  If you are looking for a more in depth ride with the Beatles, from a journalists point of view, I would recommend "Ticket To Ride" by Larry Kane, who covered their 1964-65 American Tour.  "Imagine" all that could've been....Laurie 
 Great continuance of the author's southern writing style 
 Now 25 years old, this movie still holds up very well.  I remember how delighted we fans were when we heard that Star Trek was going to be made into a movie.  The first film was mixed for most fans.  We were glad to see the characters on the screen, but the feel of the film was too big and the story was off somehow.  This movie was the second film and everyone cheered because it was a Star Trek story through and through, with even some of the characteristic inconsistencies (Khan remembering Chekov when he wasn't even part of the crew in the TV episode), the just in time miracles, and much more.    Ricardo Montalban is spectacular as the genetically altered Khan Noonien Singh that Kirk had left on a lush planet fifteen years before.  Kirk is now an admiral who is uncomfortable with old age and leaving his starship, a new crew is being trained to take over the Enterprise, and Chekov is on an expedition on the Reliant with Captain Clark Terrell (well played by Paul Winfield).  Terrell and Chekov set down on a waste planet and discover evidence of Khan's existence on this planet and try to flee, but it is too late.  The rest of the film is Khan drawing Kirk into an obsessed confrontation much like Ahab and Moby Dick.  You can pretty much guess that it is just as unlikely to end well for Khan.  It is the path the confrontation takes that is so interesting for Trek fans.  And the famous denouement is either quite moving or an impossible hoot, depending on how seriously you take these stories.  I was moved by the way they played it.   It was the next movie that we all had to swallow hard to believe, but it got us back to where we needed the story to be.    Hey, at least they didn't make it a dream or something from an autistic child, right?  We watched this with my teenage son last night, and he enjoyed it a great deal, so new generations continue to become fans of this series.  As well they should 
 This is a great debut album from a very talented Canadian artist named Amanda Marshall. She's had big success in Canada, but not so much in the US. I don't understand why that is, and if you listen to this CD I think you'll agree with me. There was 6 big singles from this album, and even the non single tracks are awesome. The closing track "Promises" is stunning and raw in emotion. "Let It Rain" was the first single and it's definately a powerful song that resonates with listeners, a song about searching for redemption. "Dark Horse" was also a big hit. "Birmingham" is a great song about a woman in an abusive relationship who finally leaves her man. "Fall From Grace" and "Beautiful Goodbye" were also singles and other favorites of mine. I highly recommend checking this CD out if you haven't already 
   Because a 5-star rating might imply perfection, I hate to give 5 stars to any book.  However, while this book is not perfect, its virtues are so great (especially in comparison to most other painting-technique books) that it deserves such a high rating.       Macpherson's first book, "Fill Your Oil Paintings With Light and Color," is also excellent.  With this new book, and its beautiful paintings to illustrate the text, he expands on painting landscapes.  Both books are very useful.     If I were to criticize, it is that, very occasionally, the book introduces a thought that could have been more fully elaborated.  And potential buyers should understand that the book does not go into great detail on how to paint specific aspects of landscapes (e.g., clouds, water, trees, etc.); and that seems to be intentional.  Rather than address brushstrokes, etc., this book goes right to the heart of things, to concepts that will more fundamentally improve how one paints.  (I'm talking here about concrete, practical advice, not metaphysical fluff.)  Such principles can indeed be found in some other books, but this book states them more clearly, and with better illustrations, than any other book I can think of.  This book keeps one's focus on what is most important to a successful painting.       In short, this is a substantial book that makes many other art books seem rather superficial, or at least unclear, by comparison.  This book will probably not obviate the use of specialty books (e.g., on painting clouds)--of which there are some excellent ones--rather, this book will give you the foundation on which to better apply the advice of those other books.  As you can tell, I like this book.  I suspect it will be regarded a classic 
 I always use these types of drugs for energy boosts, not as a daily supplement for weight loss. One capsule will keep you alert with no noticeable effects, where 2 will give you that jittery feeling for an hour or so. If taken before exercise, I tend to feel extremely warn out afterwards, but in a good way, like it just really enhances the burn. My water in take definitely increases when I take it. As far as other types of similar drugs, this pretty much falls in line with the rest 
      Josephine Johnson won the Pulitzer Prize for 'Now In November' in 1935 at the age of 24.  This was her first novel.  It is a shortish work, running all of 231 pages, but what fills these pages is astonishing.  Powerful and wise, wrenchingly real, 'Now In November' immerses the reader into a world harsh and unforgiving during a time of trial and drought, rendered  through a poetic prose that cuts to the quick.         The narrator is Marget, a quiet soul who sees all and feels deeply yet cannot utter what fills her mind and her heart ~ and therein lies her fatal flaw.  Marget seeks solace in the woods and hills and the small beauties of nature, finding loveliness where she can even as the world around her agonises from lack of rain.  Despite the drought, work on the farm is unrelenting, rounds of planting and milking and incessant hoping for rain ... and always, always running beneath this a continuous fear and worry to make the mortgage and meet the debts.         Adding to the worries of farm and weather is eldest daughter Kerrin, beautiful but dangerously insane.  Her erratic behaviour hones a razor edge to all that the family endures.  Everything comes to a head when a hired man arrives and falls in love with the youngest daughter, Merle.  Merle is the most resilient of the three sisters ~ hearty, jolly, loud and opinioned, the antithesis of her sister Marget.    Kerrin immediately sets her twisted sights on Grant in a wildly unhinged manner which proves her complete undoing. Behind the scenes, scarcely noticed, Marget loves Grant with a hopeless, mute, soul-cracking love; she can only stand by helplessly as Grant suffers from his own unrequited love.  Merle does not love Grant, she loves the land and her mother and her father and her sense of duty; there's no room in her heart for more.  Marget has the room, she'd welcome Grant unreservedly, but dares not suggest her feelings to him as she understands she'd never fill Grant's emptiness ~ the void that only Merle would satisfy.         One night a fire starts on the farm, ravishing more than land and crops.  The mother is mortally injured, and Kerrin finally succumbs to the dark demons in her mind.  Grant, cast adrift amongst the wreckage, arrives to a final, permanent decision. After that nothing is the same.         Yet, the land remains, and the farm, and the debt.  And Merle, to bear her burdens and work like a man. And Marget, who in the end loses the most but must endure, refusing to believe that this is the end.  She says as much.  'And if this is the consolation of a heart in its necessity, or that easy faith born of despair, it does not matter, since it gives us courage somehow to face the mornings.  Which is as much as the heart can ask at times.'     Almost breathtaking in its honesty, this is a truly remarkable novel written by a genuine talent.       Johnson attended Washington University from 1926 to 1931. In 1955, Washington University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.  She was actively interested in the problems of contemporary society and was a member of various organizations that deal with inequality and poverty, including the St. Louis Urban League, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Cooperative Consumers of St. Louis.    
 Joan Crawford is no longer the loveless "shop girl" when she goes to work for Warners playing Mildred Pierce in her comeback picture after MGM dropped her. "Mildred Pierce" is certainly one of Joan's best pictures because Joan plays such a unique character.   Mildred is a self-made women who will lay down her own life for her girls, especially her oldest; they have a special bond. Joan even marries a man to suit her daughter's needs. A terrible crime is commited with a shoking ending!  This is a high-energy suspense film that really captures Joan's true acting capabilities. Joan Crawford won the much-deserved Best Actress Oscar for her role in this picture.    Joan passed on before I was born but she has made a lifelong fan in me, partly because of this classic 1940's picture 
 Love his outfits. I was surprised to see he did the costumes for "The Wizard of Oz". Love old Hollywood 
 This is an enchanting biography of the most important and charismatic figure in Russian history.  Its virtues abound; it is deeply researched, it is well-written, it is balanced, and it does an excellent job of placing Peter into the context of his times.  While it's not a classic scholar's history, chock-a-block with footnotes and citations to other literature, in the 25+ years since it was originally issued, there have been no serious criticisms of Massie's broad themes.  Make no mistake: this is a definitive biography.  We travel the full length of Peter's life, from his earliest education and his days playing at soldier, past the intrigue over his accession to the throne, to his days as mature and sole autocrat. The development of Peter's personality is shown artfully. We see Peter's development from a curious, bright and energetic youth, to a young and not wholly serious sovereign, and, over the course of the Great Northern War, to a leader of his nation who becomes aware of his role and its burdens.  Massie shows all sides of Peter; this is not fawning hagiography.  Peter's virutes, his generosity, his energy, his intellectual curiousity, his personal loyalty, his desire to build his nation, his zest for manual labor, his lack of personal pretentiousness, are matched by his weaknesses, his irascibility, his wild carousing, his ruthlessness and his savagery.   To tell the story of Peter's life is also to tell the story  of Russia in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and Massie helps readers who are not historians understand the world in which Peter lived.  He achieves this by providing mini-portraits of many of the other world leaders with whom Peter interacted, such as George I of Hanover and England, Louis XIV and his successors, Charles XII of Sweden and literally dozens of others. Beyond mere character sketches, Massie also provides social, military and economic background to the events that affect these other nation states and Russia.  The central struggle that defined Peter's reign was the long war against Sweden and its allies. Because that war was long, and in the manner of European conflicts of that era, constantly marked by shifting alliances among the combatants and allies, the history of that war takes up the largest chunk of the book.  So we get detailed descriptions of the major battles, but also the diplomatic counterpoints, how Peter and his court sought to assemble allies and break down Sweden's alliances.  And from an historian's perspective, it is entirely fitting that the Great Northern War form the centerpiece of his biography.  The war dominated Peter's adult life and the eventual Russian victory dethroned Swedish dominance in the Baltic region and established Russia as a major European power. Some readers may be put off by the level of detail regarding the military campaigns, but I would say this is an example of what makes the book so valuable, its incredible depth.  But Massie does not ignore the social changes that Peter brought to Russia.  There are chapters on the overhaul of the Orthodox church that Peter imposed, on the reform of the bureacracy (and the creation of the later infamous table of ranks), the spread of education and the westernization of Russian society.  Massie also discusses in detail the founding and subsequent rise of St. Petersburg, which, along with the founding of the Russian Navy, may have been Peter's greatest legacy to the Russian people.  Some reviewers have complained about the length; for all the reasons I have outlined above, I found the depth of Massie's work a huge plus, and not a hindrance.  And because the book is so well written, I didn't bog down reading it at all.  I think Massie's Peter well rewards the time spent reading it.  
 If I could give this novel ten stars, I would because this is everything that a novel should be.  The twists and turns in the plot capture your interest and hold you captive yet it is the rich lyrical use of language that truly make the book memorable. This is an author who uses words like magic to weave you into a spell of love and intrigue.  The epilogue of this plot-driven novel is satisfying at all levels and the author does the reader the great service of truly wrapping up the novel to a lovely and believable ending.   The only negative that I would caution about is that on occasion the jump from the novel being told in the voice of Joanna to the voice of Kamla is not a smooth transition.  However, it is hard to conceive of any way in which the author could have made the transition less jarring.   In the beginning it is somewhat disappointing that Aidan is not a fully drawn out character that would allow the reader to fully understand why Joanna is so driven in her search for the truth. Yet as the novel progresses, it becomes more clear why the author is so clever in slowly revealing the complexities of this character.  The insights into history and culture whet your appetite to learn more about Asia in the post World War II era.  This is a book that will capture the delight of book clubs for the foreseeable future 
 If you want to make less mistakes, save time and money, it's best to start with this book so you can get the correct service, venue, and evidence organized to file and win. I found the chapter on how to write a demand letter and settle your claim before it gets to court very helpful. They even offer sample letters you use to settle your case. Nolo Press seems to put together the best legal self help books 
 Sandburg's American Songbag is a national treasure. I suppose the words and music of these 280 songs, ballads, and ditties that people have sung forever could be found elsewhere, but where? This important work, which  breathes life back into some of the most memorable old songs, was  originally published in 1927 
 The indignant and arrogant demands for ease of understanding expressed by so many reviewers here exemplify the passive, anti-intellectual customer service-based epistemology that Spivak educates us against and that drives todays globalizing and enslaving culture.  Her book is profound and urgent 
 Richard Morris has done a wonderful job of taking what should be a dry topic and making it very interesting.  The Last Sorcerer details the discovery of the elements and the people behind these discoveries.  Along the way we meet a number of brilliant eccentrics, would be charlatans and an interesting collection of scientists and non-scientists.  The chapters are short and punchy.  The book flows well.  From the beginning we learn that while the ancient Egyptians had identified seven distinct elements, thanks to Aristotle, the field of Alchemy was born thus leading to the belief that all things were made up of four elements: air, water, earth and fire.   From there it was quick jump to the belief that base metal (e.g., lead) could be transferred into gold.  For centuries afterwards, alchemists struggled to reconcile this theory with their observations.  But in that struggle chemistry was born.  Perhaps the best chapter is the one about the work of the Russian scientist Mendeleev and his work to discover the periodic law.  When my children were studying the periodic table, I read this chapter to them and it helped to better understand and bring to life the dry and seemingly unfathomable periodic table.  But there are other great chapters about many scientists from Boyle to Rutherford.  For those non-scientists who seek to expand their knowledge about the history of science and learn a little chemistry along the way, this is a great book.  It is a bit old for children under 13 (and there is some language in the book) but you may find yourself reading a chapter or two to your children when they begin complaining about their chemistry class that day. 
 Excellent. Author has really done his homework, and the historical events he throws in along with the main story line are fasinating.  Reminded me somewhat of "The Devil in the White City" for interesting tidbits. 
 Bleedin' footzies, an old man helping the Crimson King himself - Jack Sawyer, no longer a small boy but a grown man and acclaimed police officer who seemed to have no fear of death in his dealings. He leaves the job to go back to his roots, he doesn't need the money, his mother, Queen of the B's left him financially stable when she passed on so he settles down in a rural town in a nice house. Kids are being killed there and the local cop begs him to help, he has heard of his reputation and really and truely needs help. The killer leaves no trace of himself, Jack doesn't want to but a local friend he has made, a blind radio dejay advises him that it would be unforgivable to turn his back on what was happening when he obviously had a gift for detecting. Jack wakes up one morning and KNOWS he's in the Territories, he knows this is an indication of bigger things. He meets who he thinks is Speedy - but it's his twinner and he advise of a spirit that can reside in the bodies of evil people in our world in order to snatch kids to break the beams of the Towers as required by the Crimson King himself. There is a house nearby painted black, it poisons people who get near it. Jack goes in with the help of a gang of local bikers - one of the bikers has lost a child to this beast. Without spoiling the book I can advise that I was shocked at who the killer was and further to that we come close to losing our hero. Awesome. A magnificent tome - a mammoth read well worth the journey.  
 I had been considering trying macrobiotics for a few years before it became trendy and this book was released. The first books I consulted were by Kushi and incredibly dry; they made it seem too challenging; focusing on foods I could not find and appliances that needed to be bought in order to start. Then I read Jessica Porter's book and it convinced me to take the plunge.  Her writing is accesiible and she includes entertaning anecdotes from her experience with discovering macrobiotic philosophy. Hte personal conversation stlye makes the information easier to remember and apply than other texts. She makes macrobiotics seem posisble for any one, any where they live. I do not live near a thriving organic community, but she supplies a wide range of resources, online stores, helpful web sites and other useful books to help in the transition. Though she was trained at the Kushi Institute, she gives readers knowledge of the full range of approaches that exist.  Did you know that there is a macrobiotic equivalent to Reese's peanut butter cups? She gives the recipes for these, as well as other deserts for special occasions, in addition to the staple dishes that constitute a macrobiotic eating system.  I do wish tht the book had more recipes, and found the book "Cook Your Way to the Life You Want" and Cooking Whole Foods" by Christina Pirello excellent complements. They are not necessary additions, but Porter made me eager to read much more about macrobiotics.  Macrobiotics is learning how to balance food to meet your body's nutritional needs, which will vary depending on your daily activities and stress. It tkaes a life time to master, but Porter provides excellent ropes to help you start immediately, if you so wish. She also provides a gradual (her recommended) approach. An excess of sweets, for example, is not recommended as healthy on average, but she give recipes for safer alternatives to combat cravings caused by mass marketing campaigns of the food industry, as you being your journey into macrobiotics.   There were times when I thought the book indulged a little too much into "feel the power of the universe" rhetoric, but the truth of the matter is that what you eat affects not only your health, but also your moods, and an improved diet helps increase your powers of perception, by making you less vitim to illenss and mood fluctuations.   There are some macro books that I have purchased and had to read again and again, because they were so complicated. This one I reread because I enjoy and am inspired by the writing.    
 The vendor surprised me in delivering the book in two days. Also the book came with an e-book which I used on my dual monitor set up. It is fantastic to be able to read the e-book on one monitor and then the program on another.  Also the book was 1/2 the cost than Barns and Noble.  I would definately use this vendor again. He is a great asset to Amazon.com  Sincerely  Joe Petryshyn 
 If it had a faint logo on the back like real photo paper no one would know the difference!  This paper and the Epson Stylus Photo 960 are an excellent combination 
 Are you in love? sad? passionate? angry? Even before Lucio Battisti, Italians have been singing about their emotions; Battisti's songs are the best example of this. Since the 70's young Italians have sung about love  with Battisti's songs. He is the first choice at parties on warm beaches of  Portofino or hiding from the cold at Madonna di Campiglio. If you've just  ended a relationship, and want to express Romeo and Juliette-esque feelings  or you'd like to dream about life in Italy, Battisti is your choice.  Although Battisti died last year, he is alive and well in Italian souls 
 This is the best of the half dozen Thurlo novels I've read.  Ellen Clah, head of the Navajo Reservation Major Crimes Unit, must find out who killed Jimmy Blacksheep, a Navajo national guardsman, who was on his way home from serving in Iraq.  The rental car he was driving is missing.  The obvious suspects are a car-jacking ring that has been operating on the Rez for some time.  Clah, however, quickly decides that Blacksheep's murder is not simply a botched car-jacking.  MOURNING DOVE is more purely a police procedural than the other Clah mysteries I've read. Navajo life and traditions form the background rather than the foreground of this story.  Clah's latest family problems are woven smoothly into the non-stop police action.  In addition to the tribal police, the Farmington PD, the county sheriff's office, the FBI, the ATF, the CIA, and the US Army CID are drawn into the widening investigation.  One wishes those agencies worked as well together in the real world as they do in this Thurlo novel 
 This book was awsome.  I read the others in the series, so I devoured this one in just one day.  I love these books, and I think this was my favorite.  
 The Imponderables book series by David Feldman is the pinnacle of interesting and useful bathroom reading!  Since the beginning of the series, Feldman has been highlighting questions that we didn't even know we had (like exactly why is it that a mile is 5,280 feet? and where is Donald Duck's brother?) then he finds "the experts" on any given subject to answer the question.  At the end of each question and answer, you are left with a little better insight into the world around you (and you can go out and impress your friends with an expanded catalog of obscure anecdotes).  These books are fantastic overall.  They are one part almanac, one part encyclopedia and one part a book form of the show Mythbusters.  Many of the questions Feldman seeks the answers to are sent to him by his many readers who want to know about these little-known facts (like why there are 18 holes in a golf course and why tennis balls are fuzzy).  Okay, these may not be the most important questions in the world, but these are the things we take for granted in everyday life that we normally don't take the time to stop and think (why is that little finger on our hands called the pinky?).  Feldman has been answering these questions since the first Imponderables in 1986.  He has a masters degree in popular culture from Bowling Green State University in Ohio and taught to first ever college course on Soap Operas.  If you enjoy trivia, David Feldman is the man for you.  He uncovers the hidden meanings and lost history of sports, food, words, science, politics, and everything in between, often in a humorous and insightful way.  So where did Oreos get their name? What is the difference between Dead End signs and No Outlet signs? Why does the letter K mean Strike Out in baseball?  You'll have to buy the books to find out 
 I love this one, I have ordered almost all her books and this is a great read dont miss it.  For all you doubters.  I am convinced Suzanne and her people know what they are talking about!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 The original 3055 manual was a highlight of the FASA years, in my own humble opinion, and the art in there gave us some of the best miniatures in the universe, such as the Gallowglas, the Gunslinger, and the Grand Titan. However, it was plagued by that most FASA of occurences, errata. Tons of it. LOADS of it. Did they even look at it? Once you got past little things like the Titan weighing 7.25 tons too much, it wasn't half bad. The new manual corrects all that, and adds dynamic new art for some of the best 'Mechs by Matt Plog. With the addition of new fluffed out variants and 'notable Mechwarriors' and Solaris VII Mechs (level 3 for the first time in a TRO, baby!) it's not just an Upgrade, it's a whole new beast. Trust me, any fan of Battletech won't mind having both the 3055 and 3055U in their collection. 
 This is a great book for either a daily devotion for personal use or as material for a men's study group. For either use it gives you considerable material for thought and prayer in directing your life to Christ. As a group study using the study guide included in the back of the book as started questions, you can develop great men's ministry sessions that holds the attention of the men 
 This is a great book for those that are looking to starting to have children.  It really goes in depth on the different ways both the woman and man can go about preparing their bodies.  I thought it did focus a bit to much on the overweight individuals and talking about how they should lose weight before pregnancy, and spent no time addressing those of us who are in shape and what we can do to better prepare our bodies.  Overall, I give it an A 
 My 4 year old received this from Santa this Christmas.  It is great.  No batteries too!!  He can charge the cars up himself and the race is on.  (Just push them back and forth.)  He had rec'd a Hot Wheels set from a family member before Christmas.  (The box had a large bird on it.)  One of the cars starting springs was broken, so only one car could go around the track.  The large bird would not fly, it would pop out of it's holder and dive...down.  Returned it.  We are so happy that Santa brought this one instead of another Hot Wheels set!   
 The famed "gravel voice" is not on these recordings, if you're a fan of the "Closing Time" and "Heart of Saturday Night" era, you'll love it. I don't think the "Rain Dogs" or "Mule Variation" fans  (or even the ones who like the "Small Change" era material) will like it as much, but they'll be curious to at least hear it once. Most of the songs on vol. 1 and 2 are demos from that period. A lot of Dylan, country and folk influences are here more than they would be on later recordings, all the songs stripped down to the basics, probably the way he was performing the songs around that time.   They do sound like polished demos although it also gives it an "honest" sound to it as well.   This is essential for completists who already have everything by him including "Tales From the Underground" (kept within the fan circles) although keep in mind that he fought not to have this released. It is good though....    
 The guide itself - like most Lonely Planet guides - is divided into basically two parts: First, things to know before you go, like history, geography and climate as well as information about visas, customs, money, health, etc. Second, the "traditional" description of places, monuments and museums as well as tips of where to stay and where to eat.  The book is written in a casual way that makes reading easy, but still gives precise information when needed. On my last trip to Venice I found that almost all prices, opening times and other details where up to date. Another detail I liked was that some recommended hotels had their e-mail addresses in the guide. It made advance reservation so easy, and I am not talking about a Hilton, but a midrange hotel. One point that some people might find offensive is that sometimes the authors don't hesitate to give their personal opinion about politics, lifestyle, etc. But if you just take it for what it is, an opinion, and are able to go, see for your self, and make up your own mind, than this travel guide is for you. I really recommend it 
 I am a more recent golf fan and not a player, but I devoured this book from page one and loved it. The author fills in wonderful details of Bobby Jones' legendary life and career (what a marvelous man he must have been), as well as telling a gripping story of a mythical relationship between him and the young player whose own meteor never had a chance to streak across the sky. Naturally golf lovers will love it, but that said, I think anyone who enjoys a good sports story or a story about great relationships tested in tough times will also love it. It's a jewel of a book -- don't miss it 
 I bought this book to help plan a 10th anniversary trip for me and my wife in Italy.  It was perfect--the routes, suggestions, etc., etc.  But what really struck me was the humorous voice that Soverinsky uses and the liberal amount of really hilarious stories.  For instance, there's a photo of a bunch of people in sleeping bags at a campground. And the caption reads:  "If you ask me, nothing beats camping in Europe.  Except, of course, a nice hotel room."  Really great stuff.  I've shared it with friends who have no interest in cycling but who've laughed out loud at the short stories and photo captions.    This is not your typical guidebook.  It's informative AND entertaining. 
 Like Alex's other books, sound biblical scholarship is combined with a heart for real people with real challenges. The first half of the book made me weep. It's a wonderful treatment of the source and motivation of love. Love that endures and ultimately blesses has to come from a well deeper than the one in my heart. Alex presents Jesus clearly and how both he and those who knew him, loved others with strength, sincere emotion and purpose. The second half of the book is very practical as Alex discusses the many facets of love. I especially appreciated his treatment of the disciplinary aspect of love. This is rarely done well in the church and it is to our harm that it is so. I also enjoyed the anecdotes of love and particularly those about Robert Chapman, who seems to have had a rare ability to love well. Although the book is addressed to leaders, it would be a shame if people chose not to read it for that reason. Its message, though of particular importance to Christian leadership, is needed throughout Christ's kingdom. 
 This movie is crazy. It is one of the Vengeance trillogy movies. This movie really impressed me. I already had high expectations for the movie, but this movie really brought it. Mr. Vengeance satisfied my expectations and then some. The majority of the people I showed this to really liked it. Some of the people I showed it liked it, but they weren't blown away like the rest of us. This is one of my favorite movies in my movie collection. It's a good flick 
 I love Baron and I loved this book.  I started an at home yoga practice   with his dvd's and this book and it got me hooked on yoga to where I was at a 5 day a week practice or more. He is so easy to connect with because he is so very personable and genuine.  The yogic principles are so straightforward and the whole book is an easy access to a newcomer to yoga 
 This story of the year album is not that bad.  If you listen it is actually not a bad CD concerning story of the year has changed a bit but come on.  Page Avenue is still better.  If story of the year still kept their punkish screamo mood the same then this CD could have been better.  This CD is in the style of alternative metal.  This band is still good but this CD doesnt match up to their strong and powerful debut album Page Avenue 
 This book gives good basic information on penguins in a very fun format.  The poems are catchy.  I teach 3-6 year olds and I caught them repeating the phrases they liked the best.  I highly recommend it for this age group 
 It was a great book, and I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys 19th century England, history in general, or 19th century English authors.   The book is composed of two parts. The first is a topical overview of all aspects of everyday life and society in 1800s England.  What did they eat? How did they farm? How did they keep clean? Who had a higher social standing? What did the poor and the orphans do?  All of these questions and many more are answered in an easy-to-read and entertaining way.   The second part of the book is a glossary of terms which might be unfamiliar to the reader of 2006.  When is Lady-Day?  What's a costermonger?  What exactly is a pelisse?  This second section would be particularly useful if one needed to look up an unfamiliar term while reading Dickens or Austen or any of the many other 19th century writers. 
 The second edition of this book is now available with entirely updated information about fibroids, embolization, ovarian cysts, abnormal bleeding, new techniques for endometrial ablation, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy and many other alternatives to hysterectomy. A new chapter about contraception and another about common bladder problems have been added to the updated information about other common problems such as abnormal pap smears, endometriosis and pelvic pain. When you order this book, be sure to ask for the new, SECOND edition. We think you will find it an invaluable resource 
 Tim Price  in  this  book has written how  the church  needs  to keep  it's eye on  the Lord and impacting  others for him and not  get caught up with  the notion that political action  is  the answer. I'm  thankful Tim has  written   "The Diluted Church." You may  not agree with  Tim on everything  I don't but it still has  things we need  to  ponder.     Timothy Price  believes those on  the religious right should admit something is wrong. Price has outlined  why that should be done  in "The Diluted Church.".       Tim says religious conseratives are going about doing  things  the same as  they were 40 years ago  even though much  hasn't changed.      Price  believes many  Fundamentalist, Evangelical and Charismatic leaders  have taken their cues from sources other than the scriptures.    "In all the current clamor to "reclaim our culture"  and "bring America back to God,"  have we not forgotten a very important perspective? Peter noted, "For  it is time for judgment  to begain  with the household of God; and if  it begins with us, what will be the outcome for  those who do not obey the gospel of God?" (1 Pet. 4:17; cf. 1 Cor. 5:9-13). Price writes.    "The Diluted Church"  says  the church needs  to get  it own act  together before going after  the sinners  of  this world.  
 My husband bought the Chicken Little movie for our 3 year old (mostly to get us OFF the Cars movie that we all have memorized) and he fell in love with it!  He likes to act out the scenes and loves the music.  He loves this CD at night when he's going to bed.  We all have to dance to One Little Slip (he knows all the words) and then we have to "shake our tail feathers" before he jumps in bed every night!  I enjoy the cd too, so it's good for everyone!  
 right till the very end... and is nothing like the movie, Time Line has the reader's heart raceing til the final page.. 
 Excellent review of history of bees-beekeeping in America from a historical, cultural and global perspective. It is not a technically laden text. This would be a great book for extra credit reading - discussion for an American History college/university course. It is highly recommended for both general and scholarly readers. 
 Sweet Jesus Mary Mother of God!!! This is the best album I have bought in a long time! I bought it along with Aperitif for Destruction, and ever since I put the disc in my CD player, I haven't stopped smiling. I would recommend it to those who like uplifting tunes, who always see the glass as half full and honestly believe that every cloud really does have a silver a lining. Honestly, they do! It is such a fun album. I am now a Richard Cheese addict and am spreading the cheese as far as it will be tolerated! Every song is pure genius. Happy listening. x 
 In fact, buy all of Wright's material. Wright is an unparalleled genius in Christian thought. His work is essential to understanding the New testament in our day and age. Why are you still reading? Stop it! Go get this now 
 This novel immensely appealed to me.  The story flowed really well.  The word choice was excellent.  And it was an excellent insight about how women often fell.  The reality of the situation transcends time.  And who wouldn't want to break out of the motherly mode with a pirate.  The Frenchman was an awesome incarnation of the free spirit.  And yet her choice reflects the way true women weigh responsibility and selfish action.  This was excellent 
 Spirituality development and growth can be difficult in these modern times. St Teresa's life and spiritual journey can easily be taken in small doses and applied daily. Her mystical visions can be understood personaly - a rare treat 
 This book is a great way to start teaching your kids about appropriate and inappropriate touching.  This is a tough subject, and I didn't want to scare my little ones about this, and this book does a great job of showing children how to be assertive and say "NO" when someone wants to touch the child or wants the child to touch them 
 I really enjoyed this fun mystery by Laura Levine. It's about a freelance detective named Jaine Austen (her mother loved Austen, but couldn't spell). Jaine is an amusing character, who wears elastic waist paints in the land of single-digit sizes (L.A.).   The plot centers on Frenchie, an obnoxious blonde whom everyone hates. The problem is, when she's murdered, everyone's a suspect. The most obvious one is Becky, one of Frenchie's co-workers, who announced that she'd like to see Frenchie's corpse on the floor. Becky hires Jaine to clear her name and find the real killer.  This was a very funny book where the mystery was almost secondary to the humor. The real killer was definitely a surprise (for me, anyway) and the whole experience was so fun that I plan on reading all the other books in the series 
 The book has great illustrations and is very colorful. Good Story.  Jennifer Bouani Author Tyler and His Solve-a-matic Machine Teaching Kids How to be Entrepreneurs and Business Leader 
 The Golden Legend by Blessed Jacobus de Voragine wrote about saints that I heard and never heard while I was growing up with my Catholic Faith.  It was interesting to learn saints with names that I never knew of: St. Quentin, St. Mary of Egypt, and St. Praxedes.  The Golden Legend was more than a legend.  It was one of the most popular books to be read after the Holy Bible during the Medieval and Renaissance Era.  
 This is Robin Williams at his best. He displays a variety of talents. There is good comedy as well as a historical perspective 
 "These exercises will give you new information about yourself. You will be able to make new choices. If you are willing, then you can definitely create the kind of life you say you want." ~Louse L. Hay  Louise delves into health, fears, phobias, sex, self-esteem, money, friendship, addictions, work and intimacy issues. In her loving, caring way, she guides you through fifteen work"fun" chapters. I think this book is more fun than work. You will learn about:   1. Basic Techniques - Changing thoughts and releasing old beliefs about yourself.  2. Who Are You? What Do You Believe?  3. Health Checklist 4. Feeling Good 5. Fears and Phobias 6. Anger 7. Criticism and Judgment 8. Addictions 9. Forgiveness 10. Work 11. Money and Prosperity 12. Friends 13. Sexuality 14. Love and Intimacy 15. Your New Picture  You will find questions like: "What do you want that you are not having?" At the end of the first chapter there is a "Deservability Treatment" where you can read affirmations and perhaps extract one or two sentences for daily reflection like: "I am willing to create new thoughts about myself and about my life. My new thinking becomes new experiences."   There are many places where you can record your own thoughts about various topics like love, sex, work, money, success, failure and God. There is a place to write a story of your life and to draw a picture of your inner child.   The chapter on health might jumpstart a new healthy journey into nutrition and wellness.   If you want to pass this book along to a friend, you could also buy a small journal and make notes in the journal instead of on the pages. This book could also be used as inspiration for journal writing. This book gave me a great idea - to create an entire book just of affirmations. A lot of our self-talk can make us miserable or enlightened.   Louise L. Hay also focuses on reflection, meditation, visualization and relaxation. She presents a pathway to a more positive and fulfilling life that is filled with daily discoveries of beauty and nurturing elements. It is time to start loving ourselves more and time to heal our lives.   "Criticism breaks down the inner spirit, and never changes a thing. Praise builds up the spirit and can bring positive changes." ~Louise L. Hay  ~TheRebeccaReview.com  
 This is an essential live recording and one of the best CDs issued for Judy Garland. Her voice is robust as ever and her performance here and delivery is exceptional and among her best ever. Her essential standards are here and are so endearing. Godspeed Judy, you voice remains forever. 
 I loved The Electric Company when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s.  Why they took it off of television is beyond me.  My husband and I loved watching the DVD and reminiscing over our favorite characters and sketches. Morgan Freeman is my all time favorite from this show. My 5 and 7 year olds were automatically hooked on the show after one episode!  But I do have one complaint about this particular DVD.  There is the offer to buy this AND the Best of Electric Company together.  My advice...don't buy them together!  They fail to tell you that the five episodes on "Best of the Best" are also included on the 4 disc set, so you will have 2 copies of these five episodes if you buy both. But the entertaining and educational memories from this show are priceless; I wouldn't return them for anything!   
 This book is a great compilation from leading ethnobotanists, describing the field, and bringing pertinent issues to the fore.  It is an excellent collection, with well-renowned ethnobotanists like Plotkin, Balick, and Naranjo.  It is an excellent source, and tells all about ethnobotany, the science that may preserve human existence now, and in the future 
 I have always admired Lauren Bacall for surviving Bogart's death and carrying on, both for herself and her children.  I never knew the full scope of the love between her and Bogart and the crushing sadness of his illness and pain before he died. I wept as I read. As a single mother who's gone through some of that pain in my own life,in West Hollywood and in Tennessee, I have actually grown to love her strength.  She's suffered, triumphed, and made mistakes and is not ashamed of what she's been through.  She is a diamond. 
 This two volume story is elegant, moving, and fun.  The monk, Shuyun, comes to be spiritual advisor to the Shonto family.  From there, we have intrigue with the emperor, a barbarian invasion, complex politics, wild battles, and an elegant fictionalized China, complete with lovely poetry.  Buy both volumes at once, and throw away the remote control

 In the Series of Unfortunate Events there are three regular children:   Violet, who loves to invent  Klaus, who loves to read  and Sunny who loves to bite   Violet is the oldest, Claus the middle child, Sunny is the youngest.  The Reptile Room continues where Lemony Snicket's The Bad Beginning ends. The siblings are living with their new guardian professor Montgomery. He is a reptile scientist. In a room with many different reptiles, there's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly, dangerous snake. But it's not really dangerous at all.   Later Montes get a new assistant and it is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course something terrible happens to Uncle Morty after that and Count Olaf again tries to kidnap the children. To find out what happens next, you'll have to read the book 
 RFB ablely illustrates and explains the fish actions commonly observed by divers and snorkelers.  This volume will increase the novice's understanding and enjoyment of the acquatic environment.  The pictures are  excellent and the author nicely translates scientific jargon to  readability.  The binding is sturdy but flexible so it is easy to pack into  your dive bag.  However, I expect that most dive destinations will have a  well thumbed copy on hand soon.  My only criticism-- Ned doesn't deal with  my favorite box fish.  This is a great book. I expect to carry it with me  on every dive trip 
 I own this DVD as well as the Concert in the Park DVD; I was also at both concerts -- each had a different feel, and each DVD has a different feel.  Several reviewers have compared the two DVDs and, like most of them, I prefer the "Old Friends" DVD, which isn't to say that the Central Park concert is not worth owning.    The sound quality of Old Friends is superior, but that may be a function of the venue as well as of the updated recording technology -- at an outdoor concert, some of the sound is lost to the open air, while at a place like Madison Square Garden the sound is contained by the venue, and thus feels richer.    Though Simon & Garfunkel were backed up by a band in both concerts, the Central Park concert is more folky, with a peaceful outdoor concert feel (which is exactly what it was).  The Old Friends concert, on the other hand, often seems to emphasize the rock aspect of "Folk Rock," which is a nice change from the Simon & Garfunkel sound I'm used to hearing.  Its venue, better sound quality, and lighting effects, also give it more drama.  On a flatscreen TV with excellent sound, the Old Friends concert provides the richer experience.  My choice of which to watch, however, depends on my mood:  I was at the Central Park concert the day before my first day of highschool, so if I'm feeling nostalgic I'll watch the Park concert; if I want more of an energetic, arena feel, I'll watch Old Friends.  As far as I remember, the only song they did at the Garden that was cut from the DVD was the Everly Brothers' "Let it Be Me."  This isn't a big deal for me, though I'm sure some Everly Brothers fans aren't happy.  Other than this, there's little I can add to what's already been said about this DVD.   
 I've been listening to this album for close to 2 years since it's debut.  It is an acoustical dreamscape paitning avenues for hours of travel through this 5 piece town of complete children book pictures.  Let your feelings go and enjoy this CD as I have 
 This film was made in Widescreen and it should be shown in its original format. All the production numbers take advantage of widescreen format and in this "pan-and-scan" video form they are "squeezed" in a way which does not do them justice. I was impressed by the beautiful "I speak to the stars" but the other production numbers were ruined by pan & scan. DVD please.. 
 This is one of Ted Dekker's best novels yet. The reader is given the perfect dose of info so that you know what's going on, but not what will come next. The book is reminicent of the Circle Trilogy and Thr3e, other books by the same author. It makes for an adrenaline-laced read. Basically, "Saint" is a black ops guy who can't remember who he is except that Kelly is his wife. Or is she? He's great with a gun, his hands, and his mind. He can survive anywhere but he can't remeber where he last went to sleep. If you even remotely like sniper-thrillers and some suspense mixed in, then get this book 
 Savannah from Savannah was wonderful, Savannah comes Undone was a lesson on standing up for what you believe,  Savannah by the Sea touched all the emotions of a Southern Lady.  As I sat in my wicker chair on my front porch in a southern town devouring this book, I felt I was with them at Seaside. Loved the romance and the life lessons....Can't wait for The Rest of the Story.     
 This lens is great for those indoor regular nothing fancy shots.  I recently used mine indoors at a restaurant and the distance or close up range was perfect. 
 I've owned this masterpiece for many years, and just "rediscovered" it over the weekend, after letting it gather dust for awhile.  I used to listen to it almost daily.  My boyfriend had never heard it before and he fell in love with it instantly.  This instrumental album says more than anything with lyrics, as Vai's guitar picks you up and takes you on an evocative journey from one emotion to another, in every corner of the spectrum.  "For the Love of God" makes me want to weep, as I've always envisioned a movie about betrayal and loss playing through my head when I hear it.  "Greasy Kid Stuff" is another stand-out piece, evoking images of a chase from land, to sea, to air.  These are just two small samples of the treasure to be found on this disc, where the maestro makes his guitar giggle, talk, and wail with the depths of human emotion.  I just plain FEEL everything in full technicolor when this album is playing.  This is not an album one hears; it is one that is experienced.  The only flaw I've ever been able to find with it is that it's not 80 hours long 
 This book is wonderful if you're looking for motivation! The body image tips it has for loving your body are great as well. I wish this book had more information on how many calories you're burning for each workout but it's not really needed since it gives you a food plan as well. There's quite a variety of information in this book. I highly recommend it 
 Seeing the video of Shayne singing Over The Rainbow gave me goosebumps, and still does every time I watch it.  And now, I can hear the song whenever I want on this amazing CD.  What a voice this guy has.  All of the contemporary songs are beautifully rendered, and the live Over the Rainbow cut is just a very fine bonus.  I will no doubt be giving this CD to a lot of people this Christmas 
 I LOVE Dr. Suess.  Really.  We have lots of his books and I enjoy reading all of them to my kids with the exception of this one.  It annoys me to no end.  That's just it...it seems like there is no end.  It's not rhymie or sing-songy like his others.  It's just repetitive and boring and ..... oh just YUCK 
 This book contains enough history about each candidate to make anyone feel confident with their vote. And, unlike almost any other political book I've read, it is suprisingly non-partisan. Furthermore, it really opens you eyes on the political fund raising system and what the candidates actually have to do before the become president.   After reading this book, it will become much easier to see through the candidates rhetoric, and this book or one like it should be a pre-requisite before voting. 
 Lear's follow up to "Running with the Buffaloes" chronicles Alan Webb's freshman track season at the University of Michigan.  I admit that I came into looking for "Running with Webb," essentially.  But Lear faced some problems it seems on the way to writing that book -- mostly that there wasn't as much running going on up in Michigan as in Boulder.  The training group he went to follow spent a lot of time not running together.  For my money the fact that an enjoyable, coherent, and informative book came out of that season shows the growth of Lear as a writer since his reporting days with "Buffaloes."  I think anyone who is actually a fan of track, or even running in general, should pick this up and give it a read.  You really get a sense of the incredible talent that Webb possesses as well as the weight of the expectations others placed on him because of it.  I felt sorry for the guy reading it -- and insanely jealous of his talent.  Buy this book and give it a read, you shouldn't be disappointed 
 This book gives a great overall description of the astral plane. It's descriptive, interesting and easy to understand 
 If you are a jazz fan, if you appreciate the sound of a band comprised of some of the west coast's best players, if well-crafted, swinging arrangements are your cup of tea, if you are a trumpet player and want to feel totally inadequate, then you must get this CD! It is big band jazz as good as any you can hear. And the virtuousity of Carl Saunders is extraordinary! He possesses a beautiful sound, a very personal creative style, remarkable technical facility and a range that almost defies description! He can play lead, he solos imaginatively and I wouldn't be surprised if he can leap tall buildings in a single bound! The band members are the who's-who of west coast artists and they play like they play together all the time....which, of course, they do....in various settings. My highest personal recommendation on this recording! 
 "HMS Surprise" is the third installment in Patrick O'Brian's seminal work of literary art depicting the friendship and adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin.  In this latest journey, Aubrey, a shining example of the Napoleonic-era fighting sea captain serving in the Royal Navy, and Maturin his ship's surgeon and secret agent of British naval intelligence, travel south through the waters of the Atlantic and into the Indian Ocean.  Of note in this book is that O'Brian captures the magic that continues through the remainder of the series; in retrospect "Master and Commander" looks more of an introductory volume, and "Post Captain" a necessary bridge between this volume and the first.  "HMS Surprise" is the better of the first three books.  In all fairness, all three are great, but I have found this story to be the most enjoyable on a first and second read.  The story begins with Maturin's capture by French agents at the Port a Mahon, now occupied by Napoleon's forces.  The adventure continues as Maturin secures a ship for Aubrey to protect the China Fleet - and for Stephen's own purpose: to pursue his lost love across the world to India.  Once in the Indian Ocean, Jack Aubrey must unite a disparate convoy of merchant vessels to fend of the attacks of a dangerous squadron of French frigates who mean to prey on the British trade.  Stephen Maturin forges a friendship with a homeless Indian child and devises a means to rescue Dianna Villiers, his love, from her so-called protector.  A number of memorable adventures occur, including being stranded on a barren rock, a drunken sloth, a tense `fleet' action, a duel and finally the outcome of Stephen's desire of Dianna.  "HMS Surprise" is a rewarding story, and I highly recommend it.  The book is one of the most fully written of the series, it just is satisfying in and of itself; once you move past it into the deeper waters of O'Brian's stories the reading becomes addictive and each individual book is not enough - you will need `just one more' 
 I have noticed that a number of the purchasers of this book made the same mistake I did when I purchased it. This pocket guide covers the shinkyouiku kani only. That is, the 1006 kanji that all Japanese are expected to be able to read and write. For students of Japanese then, this is a very handy reference during the learning process. It is NOT a sufficient reference for general use when reading written material - Kodansha's Compact Guide, which covers the 1945 jouyou kanji all Japanese are expected to be able to read and that make up the majority of written Japanese, would be a better reference 
 Exceptional book helps everyone who has this depliating disease. A must have I think .. glad i got it 
 What can I say about the latest offering from "The Great Fastby", it unreal! I have followed Leslie for years, and to be honest, he just gets better with age. If you liked "Blues to Die For" you will love this! LESLIE! GET BACK WITH JACK BRUCE FOR A TOUR!!! 
 This is one of the first records I've heard of Ani's, and I think it is amazing. I really, really love this. So I am completely bewildered by those two star reviews. Buy this album, really

 Having already read Think & Grow Rich, I didn't think that there was anything more that I could learn about PMA. I figured that this would be more of the save only on a different cover. Boy was I surprised!  W.Clement Stone and Napolean Hill joined forces for this text. W. Clement Stone used the principles in Think & Grow Rich to amass a personal and self made fortune in excess of $400,000,000 when that was worth $400,000,000.   I found chapter 2 particularly interesting. How Robert Christopher was able to travel around the world in 84 days with only $80 merely as a result of setting it as a goal, conceiving, believing and then achieving it is impressive.  Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude is divided into five parts, 19 chapters and over 300 pages. It's a fun, easy read and provides powerful strategies i.e. pilots to succeed.  In 1990, I met a very successful businessman who told me he went from unemployment living in Tampa, Fl to over $2.5 million and moved to Hawaii where he bought a boat and retired in only 18 months using these principles along with the right opportunity.     
 Murs plays his words at his very best. This album changes all my aspects towards hip-hop. He is the real thing and this proves it. The stand-out track is The Dance 
 Judith Miller et al. have successfully illustrated that the fear of nuclear weapons or terrorist-planned "dirty bomb" attacks are the least of our worries.  Rather, the danger lies in microbes and human biology.    At the height of the Cold War, Soviet and American scientists generated enough biological and viral agents to kill the inhabitants of the Earth many times over.  The problem emerging now is where have all these bio and viral weapons gone, and perhaps more important, where have the scientists gone?    Miller et al. argue the simplicity of scientific techniques necessary for creating bio and viral weapons makes them a prime device for terror.  Miller and others site a number of examples to illustrate the ease with which a bio attack is possible. For example, the Aum Shinrikyo sarin attacks on a Tokyo subway and a domestic attack of salmonella poisoning in Oregon were both committed with homemade agents.  However, these attacks pale in comparison to what could happen.  With the virulence of agents magnified to a nearly unfathomable level, if even a small amount of toxins escaped from their "safe" containers stored around the world, the death toll would be horrendous.  Miller et al. have brought to light the horrible possibilities of bio or chemical weapons proliferation, and I, for one, am in agreement.  
 Since these are Region 1 DVDs -- USA and Canada -- the official languages are English and French, so both audio and subtitles should be provided in both languages.  Subtitles help people with hearing difficulties, and help all when actors don't speak clearly or aren't recorded well.  Spanish is a good third choice.  [BTW, it would be nice if subtitle authors were required to be proficient in the source and destination languages.  Ideally, they would have access to the script.  Also, they should not make common, elementary English errors: its vs. it's, maybe vs. may be, everyday vs. every day, a lot (not alot), till or until (not 'til or til), Internet (not internet), could've or could have (not could of), OK or okay or even O.K. (not Ok or ok), for a while (not for awhile), I used to (not I use to), omitting the second delimiter of parenthetical information, hyphenating two words (a-b) when they mean to put a dash between two parts of a sentence (a--b, a - b, or a -- b), vs. or v. (not vs), etc. or et cetera (not etc...), etc.  Punctuation doesn't matter much in e-mail or in Web reviews, but these subtitle authors are being paid as professionals to create something that lasts. 
 I admit I didn't have much confidence in this movie at first, when Jennifer Lopez was the actress who played the mother. However, things began to pick up, and the theme of the story began to appear in numerous events. The relationship between the characters is intricately acted out, especially between the bonds of parents and children. Each member of the family is unique; there's Chucho with his rebellious nature, Memo with his desire to fit in and "succeed", Toni with her political endeavors, Irene with her family and restaurant, Jimmy, who is misunderstood by most, and Paco, the eldest son and narrator, who aspires to become a writer. The mother keeps this family together with her strength and love, and the "jefe" seems strict and unyielding at first, but throughout the movie, the audience can see that he really cares about his family. Following the different characters' eventful and sometimes difficult lives, one sees the importance of identity and family 
 Author Sharon Hersh speaks to a mother's heart, from a mother's heart, and offers the wisdom we long for in a culture of so many unanswered questions about how to best love our daughters.  The years of raising adolescents seem to so often trigger our own unresolved issues that it feels like the blind leading the blind.  Hersh offers us the foresight, clarity and sensitivity to connect richly with our teen girls.  Relevant and yet timeless, this book needs to get into the hands of every mother and mother-to-be of adolescent daughters 
 One of the tighter seasons - cast really revelling in their individual roles, and possibly the second funniest (after Season 5) 
 This book and all the books from Barbara are wonderful and they really help people with there problems and let you know that no matter what problems you have and they seem bad there is someone out there that has more and more hardship than you.  She lets you know about gods unconditional love and grace an how we must keep the faith.  They are everyday stories and they are wonderful, funny, and loving 
 I enjoyed this book, which is essentially a general text on modern anthropology.  It discusses not only the physical evidence for human evolution, it also outlines for the student the history and current status  of controversies within the field.  The latter includes such topics as the  "lumping" and "splitting" of species, the "out of  Africa" verses the "multi-regional" theories of modern human  origins, the Neanderthal controversey, and the evolution of consciousness  as the true measure of what it means to be "human."  The book  would make a good text for an introductory college level course to physical  anthropology but might also interest the high school level student 
 caught between two worlds, Black Jamaican and English, belonging to neither one. Antoinette Cosway was used and abused by people closest to her:  Her mother, stepfather, best friend Tia, and, of course, her husband.  She was forced in a loveless marriage to Rochester, who made no bones about his contempt for her, Creole culture, and Jamaica and who was only there to help his beleagured family.  At first, the marriage seemed loving until an anomynous man came to him with letters disparaging Antoinette and her family and his(Rochester's) unease with living in Jamaica.  Things started to go downhill after that, with Antoinette's insanity and eventual lockdown in the attic of the Rochester estate in England.  This book tells where Jane Eyre left off.  It's Antoinette's story about how she got to be the madwoman in the attic and the things that shaped her life prior to her coming to England with her estranged husband.    The book is so deep in the matrix of race, gender, class, culture clash, personality, belief systems(Creole, Black, and English), and public and private pain of those involved 
 One of my favorite short stories in Talk that Talk is Historical arenas of African American Storytelling.  It's about a slave who has an excellent memory and is demand by his massa as well as  the devel.  Well just the other week I was put in an awkward situation.  Someone emailed my boss and used my name saying they "thought" they gave me an important transaction.  This incident happened over three months ago but I remembered it as if it had happened the day before. I replied by giving names, times, and even how the transation took placed.  The people that were involved were amazed that I could remember such details.  I wanted to tell them that I was a distant relative of Sam.  But that would have been our little joke.  This story fascinates me because our people have extrodinary memories that has to be a God given talent.  What was meant for evil, always turn our for our good 
       I purchased the three remastered albums, Breakfast in America, Crime of the Century and Crisis,what crisis?. Each one a classic. Some of the most ingenious songs of that decade, and still fresh today. I already owned the Master recordings on Vinyl, but wanted the CDs to save the vinyl albums for the future. these are stars in my collection.  
 I enjoyed this book from the point of view of a white football fan looking in from the outside on the experiences of a black brotha coping with the challenge of being gay. But I was rather turned off by the many expletives on almost every page in the later chapters, as he described his struggles with alcohol, drugs, and the underground gay culture. I live on a Caribbean Island where I hear the same expletives every day, so I can appreciate the reality of "the life" but it was a bit off-putting for the general reader. Still I came away praying for Ray, that he will be able to stay on the wagon and not relapse from his addictions, and also hoping that he will sometime find a partner that he can rely on and relate to 
 so small it fits in the palm of your hand, light enough to clip on to paperback books but strong enough to clip to my laptop. lots of light which really impressed me because I bought a more expensive bulky one two weeks earlier but returned it because it hardly lit up the pages. only reason not giving it 5 stars is because i'm not sure how long before it needs a battery change and because neck might be too short for some peoples' needs 
 THIS CD IS DEFINITELY THE BEST STUDIO RECORD FROM DC TALK IT IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR TOBY McKEEHAN(MAC) SING ON A CD AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE GOES BY THE NAME TOBYMAC.

 Nevada Barr is fast becoming one of my favorite mystery writers, and Flashback is one of the best mysteries I've read this summer.   National Park Service Ranger, Anna Pigeon, has been transferred to Dry Tortugas National Park as a temporary supervisory ranger.  The Dry Tortugas are off the Florida Keys, and Garden Key (part of the national park) is the home of Fort Jefferson.  This fort served as a military installation and also, a jail during and after the Civil War.    Soon after Anna arrives, mysterious events start happening.  A fellow ranger disappears, a speedboat explodes and sinks with at least one victim, and Anna starts to think she's going crazy (the malady that caused her predecessor to take a short-term leave).  At first, it appears that these things are unrelated, but Anna eventually starts to piece this puzzle together.  At the same time, she begins reading letters written by her great aunt, Raffia Coleman.  Raffia's husband was an officer at Ft. Jefferson during the Civil War, and she writes copious letters to her sister about the trials and tribulations of living on the fort.  There was also a mystery at the fort in 1865, and soon, the boundaries between past and present are soon blurred.  Barr alternates the chapters between past and present, and each one ends in a cliffhanger, with the intensity mounting with each chapter.  It is difficult to tell if Anna will escape this book with her life and/or her sanity.    As with all Barr books, we learn something new about another National Park.  The Dry Tortugas was named because the keys were filled with turtles and there was no fresh water source.  Dr. Samuel Mudd was the most famous prisoner on Garden Key, and he is best known for treating John Wilkes Booth's leg after Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.  He was eventually pardoned because of his heroics treating yellow fever victims at Fort Jefferson.  Barr weaves him into the story, but in an entirely fictional way.  I have two complaints about Flashback, but one is that of my own doing-I haven't read them in order.  Also, I was just a bit confused when she first switched to the flashback mode.  But at least the good news is that I still have nine more books to go.   
 This album in retrospect is one of George Harrison's best albums. Unlike All Thing Must Pass, this album grows on you the more you listen to it.  The album features one track that has the commercial appeal of about five on ATMP(YOU) but it has many soulful gems that have for too long been underappreciated.  The Answer is at the End is a fantastic performance both vocally and instrumentally that has a way of sticking with you weeks after you've played it.  Tired of Midnight Blue has a surreal quality that may one day have it "discovered" by a new generation of listeners.  George was obviously going through a dark time in his life, but this album suggests that he had the stability and postive mind frame to continue to move forward out of the wilderness.  This album may not be for everybody but along with 331/3 it rates as the best of a solid performer and songwriter 
 The edition I read was the original "Discworld story" illustrated by Josh Kirby--however, this version was only published in Great Britain (I purchesed it on-line from the UK).  The pictures are enjoyable and add to the story, but aren't essential.  Rincewind is fleeing through the nether regions, though his flight echoes through Death's Domains and Ankh-Morpork.  He has chances of a million to one of escaping, which of course means that he will be summoned by a fourteen year old "demonology hacker" named Eric.  In the tradition of Rincewind tales much of Eric is spent fleeing from one danger or the other, and always suspecting apparent good fortune.  As with Twoflower, Rincewind's companion Eric doesn't believe that he is just an inept wizard--rather he must be a powerful and crafty demon!  Besides being a parody of the German tale of Faust, Eric contains several other parodies and mockeries as is quite traditional for Pratchett.  All in all I thought it was a good showing.  While this is the fourth Rincewind novel it doesn't require strictly require knowledge of the previous volumes and thus could serve as an introduction to the Disc.  If you're a longtime fan then you should definately read this tale, though if you can find the illustrated edition I would recommend that one over the purely textual version 
 So one day Mary Anne sees a haircut she likes and shows it to her friends.  They tell her it's not her at all, but she goes ahead and gets the cut anyway, along with some cute new clothes.  She starts to put on a little makeup, too.  When her friends see her new look, their reaction is less than enthusiatic.  And Dawn, her stepsister, is downright rude and mean about it.  Eventually all the girls quit talking to poor Mary Anne and start spreading rumors about her around school.  Umm...what happened to the BSC sticking together no matter what?  The only two who aren't suddenly turned against Mary Anne are Mallory and Jessi, who remain politley neutral throughout.   Although shunning Mary Anne because of a haircut and a couple sweaters is a little extreme and unlike the BSC girls, I actually think that this book is a more realistic portrayal of middle school life than many of the other books in the BSC series - friends turning on you for seemingly no reason, rumor-spreading and gossip, etc.  I'm glad that they patched it up in the end (of course, we all knew they would!) 
 This dvd is pure entertainment -- a great way to spend a lazy afternoon.  You find yourself groaning at some of the material and belly laughing at others.   Rocky & Bullwinkle are such dear characters, Fractured Fairytales, Aesop, Dudly Doright and Mr. Peabody add to the wonderful time you'll have watching this classic program.  Seeing it as an adult is a must -- we missed alot when we viewed it as kids.  This is highly recommended just for the fun of it 
 Very handy to use. Does not take up a lot of room as full size atlases. Constellation figures are a nice feature 
 Another Dilbert collection, another great Dilbert collection.  Highly recommended, of course, if you work in an IT/IS/MIS department, or just in an office.  They never get old, or out-of-date.  Mr. Adams hasn't slowed down or backed off one bit - Ratbert the $100 million CEO-reject, multiple Wally updates, Dilbert and dating....  Another worthy addition to your Dilbert collection 
 This book was absolutely fabulous.  Folger does a wonderful job of honestly explaining what God has planned for us all.  I have recommended it to all of my female friends.  However, its one downfall would be its numerous extremely-conservative references (praying for Bush to win, etc).  If you can swallow her occasional quips, I say this book is perfect 
 Bruce Campbell is the kind of guy you either love or hate, so I won't waste your time.  If you already hate him, avoid this book like a B-Movie plague, for the book is cut from the same material.  (pause)  OK. Now that we have lost the anti-Campbell faction let's take a look at "Make Love* the Bruce Campbell way".  This novel is a hoot.  It is totally silly.  From the cover, one should understand that the entire book is tongue-in-cheek.  In it we see Bruce preparing for and acting in a movie flop called "Let's Make Love!"  In the process, he joins a Southern Gentlemen's Club, fights (and looses) a duel, teaches Richard Gere how to pick up women, and while disguised as someone else, agrees to produce a movie with Jack Nicholson.  There is mystery and plenty of action toward the end with a rather surprising ending.  He flashes back on his incredible body of work, especially the Army of Darkness and Evil Dead movies.  Bruce is self-deprecating and seems to welcome and enjoy his role in life as a successful "B" movie star.  The book is funny, light and witty.   It has plenty of illustrations and photos.  It is the kind of book one would expect from Bruce Campbell. 
 Great account of an adventure. Includes all the early stages, including conception, financing, building, testing, and monitoring the competition. Especially relevant these days with all the X prize comparisons.  The writing of the actual flight is exhaustive, and sprinkled with autobiographical anecdotes to give context and color. His accounts of growing up on a Minnesota farm surely add to the American mythos of self-determination. And his days spent learning to fly through barnstorming and the Army are notable for being enchanting, yet completely straightforward and accurate.  Lindbergh says accuracy is one of his major aims. This adds to the substance of the book, since he examines his mistakes at least as much as his successes. The writing sometimes waxes poetic, as when he says "The dull blade of skill is sharpened on the stone of experience."  Overall, this is a valuable book on many levels. For the historical record of a groundbreaking flight. For the description of the early days of flight, and the adventure and pioneering spirit it embodied. And for the tale of a man who conceived a great project, found the friendly cooperation of others to help him achieve it, worked through many obstacles and setbacks to prepare for it, and then finally executed it well, despite his own human imperfections and mistakes along the way 
 This is a wonderful book, compassionate and full of important information that is presented in an objective, clear manner. Anyone struggling with this problem, either personally or because a loved one is addicted could benefit mightily from reading it. This is the book I would choose as a first step in getting someone to think honestly about the challenge of overcoming addiction and finding the path to recovery. The authors are clearly very knowledgable and have laid out all the latest research in the field in a way that is engaging and enlightening. I gave it to a friend who has thanked me over and over again for being both honest and helpful. 
 What's not to like here? It's a big case that moves a ton of air and is quiet while doing it. The only thing else I would put on it is a carying handle for LAN parties. My former case was the Antec Super Lanboy so I had high expectations for this case. It didn't let me down a bit. This rig sits on top of my desk at present and it's more quiet than my old Super Lanboy. I read a few articles about space issues when you have a big card in it but I had no problems moving the parts and pieces around to match the different configs I tried.  Setup: Intel E6600, ATI x1900 xt, 2gb OCS Platinum, Abit ab9pro,Raidmax RX630, DVD burner, floppy, Vista RC1 ... and still going....   
 I got so much out of this book that I don't even know where to start.  I began reading it as I was in the early stages of a new relationship (my first after having broken up with my ex-fiancee two years ago).  The book made me realize many things about my former relationship that I had not really acknowledged over the past couple of years. When God Writes Your Love Story showed me that if I truely focused on God, then God would take care of my relationship.  I can say that my relationship with Christ has grown tremendously in the past few months after reading this book, and I have found that by focusing my love on Christ I have more love for the man that I am currently courting.  This book was very easy to read, and it was also very fun to read.  I would definitly recommend it to anyone in their 20's who is looking for some advice about how to have a good relationship with the person God has planned for you (whether you have met them already or not!) 
 Rascals and confusion, Trollope wrote with all the elements that excited that of readers from the Victorian Era, and that can also excite ones from our age 
 Deception is a cleverly crafted suspense novel that had me laughing out loud one moment and tearing up the next. I've read one too many books with formulaic plots and overdone messages, but this is not one of them! The story is engaging, and the message is subtle yet thought provoking. And how many murder mysteries are clean enough for a child to read? My 12-year-old daughter has already read it twice!   The only bad thing about this book is once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down. Kudos to Alcorn 
 Hard to read -- conditions/events so horrendous -- not for kids (obviously)... 
 Who today could know anything about the Brown Derby restaurant and not immediately recall what generated its legendary fame?  Was it the food?  The service?  The décor?  The clientele?  Of course it's a given that all these were truly exceptional, yet none adequately explains how any Tom, Dick, or Harry from Kalamazoo would be so well acquainted with the name of this particular restaurant.  After all, they were not patrons.  For us non-celebrities, the Brown Derby probably entered our world through the hilarious exploits of Lucille Ball in the television situation comedy "I Love Lucy" in which she starred along with husband Desi Arnaz.  Who can forget Lucy's attempts to be "discovered" by a studio executive, or to get a closer look at William Holden, at the Brown Derby?    If you lived in greater Los Angeles at that time, you might have heard live KNX 1070 News Radio broadcasts at noon from the Brown Derby, and the question of the day would always be, "Tell us, George, who's at the Brown Derby today?"  That was how Lucy knew which celebrities were at the Brown Derby.  And, because Lucy knew, all of America knew:  this Brown Derby restaurant was the stars' favorite gathering place.    So, what's the point of this review?  Simply the sad fact that "George," the maître d', radio announcer, friend of Robert Cobb, and the central figure to all the famous patrons at the Brown Derby restaurant, is no where to be seen in any of the multitude of celebrity photographs in the book.  It had to be the most deliberative, vexing, and laborious part of Mrs. Cobb's work in producing this incomplete book to find enough photographs that somehow did not show a trace of Mr. George Aguilera among the celebrity patrons.  It was no oversight.  Word is that following Mr. Cobb's death, major differences arose between the Head Waiter and Mrs. Cobb as to business practices, and that Mr. Aguilera took an uncompromising stand in favor of maintaining the renowned level of quality, rather than to expand the tourist element, and in so doing, risk losing the exceptional level of service of which he was justifiably proud to offer his friends.  This book is testament to the bitter parting of ways that resulted.  How ironic then, that Mr. Aguilera's face, commonly seen on Brown Derby advertising billboards that said, "Go see George...," appears nowhere in this book of photographs.  Nor will you find any evidence that the man who announced to the world the presence of his famous dining guests, his friends, was ever there himself.  I rate this book as missing at least one star. 
 I remember when LBJ visited Australia in 1966 and received a pretty hostile reception because of the Vietnam War, this sparked my strong interest in US history and politics. I picked up this book while on holiday in the USA to find out what made this president tick. Once started l found it very hard to put down. It is a superbly written book which makes the reader feel that they are right beside LBJ as he makes his way up the path to power. The book is the result of years of prodigious research and analysis of documents, papers, letters and interviews. It contains an enormous amount of facts and details which are beautifully described.  Caro has done a magnificent job in the description of Johnson's early life up until 1941. From his childhood he had to be first in everything, whether at play as a child or as student at college he always craved admiration and respect. He needed to be  able to dominate and use people to achieve his aim to attain and keep ever increasing amounts of power. Power and more power was what Johnson was about, he craved it like a drug and could not live without it.  The book captures his life in the Texas hill country, his troubled relationship with his father who was a hard working "straight as a shingle state legislator who was described by a powerful US Congressman years later as the best man he ever knew.   Father and son both shared the passion to look after the interests of powerless and poor people and the contrast of their personalities is presented well. His father adhered to beliefs and principles while in power, but for Johnson the end justified any means. Johnson's tireless work to gain electrification for remote areas is well documented in this book.   We see Johnson hard at work in student politics, party politics and in his dealings with powerful and wealthy men, learning the arts of manipulation, flattery, deceit and self advancement. His capacity for unstinting, sustained hard work is immense. LBJ is a fast learner when it comes to understanding who wields power and how he can obtain power and influence for himself.   He comes across as a chameleon like character who tells people what he thinks they want to hear with his eye always on self advancement at the same time.  I loved the chapter on the powerful and honest Sam Rayburn, who comes across a deeply principled man.   Yet once he gains power Johnson is a genius at how to use this power to further advance himself to gain greater power and higher office. Johnson is that master politician who also knows how to use power to raise the living standards of the people who vote for him and make the voter feel that they have a friend in LBJ.    I loved this book it held me spell bound from beginning to end.  
 This book is actually supposed to be translated as "How to Know Reality".  The translated text is very interesting reading since it provides an excellent overview of the progression, stages, and latent abilities that emerge through meditation practice.  These stages and progression are common to many different platforms/styles of meditation practice.  Some latent abilities are openly discussed which is quite refreshing compared to many other "esoteric" texts.  The observations on "stilling the mental waves" are interesting in a scientific context when compared to brainwave studies of advanced meditation practitioners.   The commentary in the book is useless and appears to be written by people who did not progress very far in stilling their mental waves. 
 Simple, straight forward, very useful, but lacking in the elegance that some may require.  Enjoyed it throughly and recommend it.  This book will help understand some of the ways that you can collect rainwater without over powering your brain.  It will also help you to think out side the box, or perhaps in it if you don't mind getting wet.  One of the clearest, funniest and most useful books on rainwater 
 The CD is comprised of some of the best songs Alan Jackson has sung.  It's one big hit after another.  Great to sing along to 
 Years ago I discovered this book while studying for my electrodynamics and mechanics comprehensives.  What a godsend!  If the physics graduate student understands only ten percent of what is in this book he will do fine.  Combined with the classical texts on electrodynamics and mechanics I discovered I became truly dangerous in the realm of classical physics.  Still am much to the chagrin of my colleagues.  Still the best after all these years, I cannot recommend this book too highly 
 The back of the Penguin edition labels this book as a "sensation novel", serialized stories that were a main form of entertainment in the 19th century. I mention this because reading Armadale feels like you are watching an amazing season of a great soap--albeit this requires much more intelligence than an OC DVD.  "Armadale" starts off with the death of a an affluent man named Allan Armadale, who leaves a horrible secret to tell. I knew this would be a good novel when, unlike many other period novels, the secret still feels shocking. Too many "masterpieces" trump up such huge secrets and you're let down when it turns out to be a minor infidelity or fraud that a modern reader cannot relate to. Anyway, this secret stimulates double identities, lies, extortion, blackmail and--wait for it--murder! The plot takes more twists and turns than a Coney Island rollercoaster, but it never becomes hard to follow. This novel could justifiably be qualified as "convoluted" but it's never incoherent.  But the real reason I recommend this novel is Lydia Gwilt. She's an excellent villainess, making the average film noir femme fatale come off like June Cleaver. But the genius of this novel is how Collins plays with our consciences. Yes as moral readers we want good to triumph over evil. Or do we? One of the heroes comes off as such a moron (you'll know who when you read) that you so just want him to feel pain. After 200 pages of him fopping around, it becomes almost unbearable to read this dribble. Enter Lydia Gwilt to shake things up. LAter on in the book, Gwilt begins fighting with her conscience. While reading these portions, I was frustrated because I really wanted her to be the ultimate ice queen. In retrospect, those sections are excellent mind games that make you decide if you want Gwilt to stand for good or evil.   I completely understand why this book was reviled upon its release: Who wants to relate to the vile Ms. Gwilt? Modern readers should love "Armadale" for the very reasons 19th century readers hated it.  Is this book perfect? Hardly. Midwinter, a main character, comes off as flakey as he has whole solliloquies where he worries about fate and how it could hurt his friends. Lighten up!! Plus, the ending is way too optimistic and seems out of place with the novel. But these are minor qualms. I could go on and on about the fully-realized characters, the elaborate set-pieces and the delightfully witty dialogue (especially when Gwilt starts talking). Clocking in at over 650 pages, it's a long book. But stick with it. By page 200, you'll be thankful that you have so much more to go 
 Rhys is best-known for "Wide Sargasso Sea," which is a wonderful  book but the least important of her novels.  I recommend picking up all  four of Rhys' early novels but this is my personal favorite. Rhys is a  brilliant writer who can say more in a sentence than many authors can say  in a chapter--and she makes you feel more in a word than many authors  achieve in a novel 
 Gharajedaghi's 2nd edition has accomplished an incredible feat - he has successfully integrated and synthesized the systems dynamics of Forrester with the systems thinking and interactive design of Ackoff. Jamshid connects Holistic thinking, operational thinking, socio-cultural models/conceptions, and interactive design into a complementary whole. Our organization has learned and is using Jamshid's methodology and it is fundamentally changing the way in which we see the world and the organizations that will be able to compete in this new "flat" world.  If you're ready to escape the confines of linear thinking and classical science and management approaches to organizational problems, then this is your book. This book is written conceptually, not linearly, and challenges any reader who is used to over-simplified, mainstream books yet it is not an overly technical read that would be approachable only to high-level engineers and systems scientists. Those not having approached systems thinking before might be better off simultaneously working through Senge's Fifth Discipline and Ackoff's Best as primers. Be prepared to read it slowly and repeatedly - the ideas are profound when considered carefully and openly and might challenge many core assumptions.  Having met Jamshid on several occasions, I have found him to be one of the brighest men to grace our world with a significant contribution to share - he very well may have the current "best" answer to organizational design for our times. To dismiss him as simply an "Ackoff disciple" or another guru trying to sell his services is shortsighted. Linear, prescriptive books become best-sellers that catapult authors into 5-digit fee days - Jamshid's 2nd edition isn't the stuff of best-sellers, but rather for "best-thinkers. 
 Not only was this De La Soul's debut, it's also a landmark, classic album....De La carved out their own unique path in music and created a gem of an album on 3 Feet High and Rising....They presented an almost alternative form of hip hop...One where it was cool to let loose and poke fun at yourself instead of bragging how dope you are....As a result, they were unfairly labled "hippie's"....  The music on here is top notch...Prince Paul, the groups main producer for their first 3 albums, delivers the goods at a time when sampling laws were much, much more relaxed....They do an amazing job of sampling Steely Dan on "Eye Know"....Some of my other favorites include 'Potholes in my lawn, Me,myself and I, and the funky collab w/ the Native Tongue Crew (A Tribe Called Quest (actually just Q-Tip) , and the Jungle Brothers) "Buddy"....  I highly recommend this album for anyone... 
 I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! i first read it about six years ago and fell in love with the wonderfully written characters. Now im a twenty year old college student and picking up this book is like going home and revisiting long lost friends of my childhood. I would recomend this series to any age, i dont believe them to be just a "young adults" books. My one wish is to see Sherwood Smith come out with a fourth Wren story 
 This is a must-have book for any parent who has a child with Sensory Processing Disorder.  It includes information for helping the child at home as well as in the school system.  Goes a long way in relieving parental guilt 
 _Book Lust_, as a previous reviewer mentioned, is a bibliophiles dream, whetting the appetite and challenging readers to venture beyond their comfort zone in genre. Pearl's vivid descriptions and tantalizing summaries provide just enough information to pique your interest without giving the plot of the book away.  It is a delightful read, and I highly recommend it 
 By David M. Kinchen Huntington News Network Book Critic   Hinton, WV  - Talk about books you don't want to finish because they're so good, consider the case of "Imperium: A Novel of Ancient Rome" by Robert Harris (Simon & Schuster, 305 pages, $26). This is the first volume in a projected trilogy of the life of Marcus Tullius Cicero (106 B.C. - 43 B.C.), as told by his confidential secretary - and slave, let's not forget that -- Marcus Tullius Tiro.   "Imperium" (the supreme power in the Roman Republic) takes the reader up to Cicero's election as Consul of the Roman Republic in 64 B.C., at the age of 42, the youngest age possible. He was elected along with Hybridia, with the support of the aristocrats of the Senate, without whose support he wouldn't have made it. Cicero (Latin for chickpea) came from the landed gentry; his father was a Roman knight, which conferred Roman citizenship on the family, including the very ambitious Cicero.   Robert Harris has written about ancient Rome before ("Pompeii") as well as penning some of the best political thrillers around, including my favorite, "Fatherland," an alternate history about a Germany that won World War II and is looking forward in 1964 to a state visit by President Kennedy to meet with the 75-year-old Adolf Hitler. No, the Kennedy in the novel is not JFK, but rather his movie-producer, rum-running banker father Joseph P. Kennedy. The evil empire in the novel is not the U.S.S.R., but rather a Germany that rules Europe, including the former Soviet Union.   If you liked the 2005 HBO miniseries "Rome" - and who didn't? - you'll find many of show's characters present in "Imperium," including Gaius Julius Caesar, Servilia, the sister of Cato, Cato, Cicero himself and many more.   Cicero is a fascinating character and an ideal one for a skilled historical novelist like Harris (by the way, he's not to be confused with Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter; this Harris is an Englishman, born in 1957, who has been a TV journalist as well as a print one). Marcus Tullius Cicero, the so-called "novus homo," or "new man," was the first professional politician in the view of many and was the first non-aristocrat to become a Consul of the Roman Republic - the peak of power - albeit shared with another man - in the republic.   Cicero is endlessly fascinating, especially in his deal-making and compromising, but I really identified with Tiro, following Cicero hither and yon, taking down his every word in the shorthand he invented, subtly giving the Roman advice and doing the dirty work. Three years younger than Cicero, he was the great man's eyes and ears and press agent. As one of Cicero's young male interns points out, Tiro had no life outside of the household on the Esquiline Hill - one of Rome's fabled seven hills - presided over by Cicero and his aristocratic and sharp-tongued wife Terentia.   Tiro grew up in the same rural setting of Arpinium east of Rome as Cicero and his ambition -- which we know from the book was later realized -- was to gain his freedom and buy a farm in the place where he grew up. Tiro is an historical figure who wrote a biography of Cicero, one that was lost in the Dark Ages; Harris's goal - wonderfully realized in this first volume - is to recreate the work of Tiro.   While he was a moderately successful lawyer in Rome, it wasn't until he took on the defense of a Sicilian who had been falsely condemned to death by the outrageously criminal governor of that island province, Verres, that Cicero gained his reputation and started his climb toward the ultimate prize.   Cicero and his entourage, including Tiro and Quintus Cicero, Marcus Cicero's brother, made a meticulous on-the-scene investigation of the crimes of Verres in Sicily and successfully prosecuted the corrupt ex-governor, who fled Rome. The Verres case made Cicero the go-to lawyer in town, rivaling Hortensius, who defended Verres.   In his ability to compromise and make behind-the-scenes deals, Cicero comes across as a very modern politician indeed. In his rise through the Senate and to other power positions on the way to his consulship, Cicero often exasperated his brother Quintus, not to mention his even more idealistic cousin Lucius, who berated Cicero with a telling statement that rings down through the centuries: "Words, words, words. Is there no end to the tricks you can make them perform?"   Harris' prose style makes these men in togas and the women who find them difficult to deal with come to life. The relationship between Cicero and Terentia, whose late-night arguments often kept the entire house awake, might call to mind the marital squabbles of two brilliant and similarly ambitious Americans: Bill and Hillary Clinton.   On a trip out of Rome, Tiro caught a glimpse of Caesar, a notorious womanizer, having impromptu sex with Mucia, the pregnant young wife of their host, Pompey. At the time, Tiro didn't tell Cicero of the incident, although Cicero commented to Tiro when he did tell him years later that a man who would do what Julius Caesar did in the home of his host would do anything.   The meeting in Pompey's estate was a summit called to deal with pirates who had raided Rome's port of Ostia, sinking a number of warships and killing many people. With the familiar cry: "Those who are not with us are against us," Pompey urges swift and decisive action against the pirates, in a manner reminiscent of the current "War on Terror." Cicero speaks out against the concentration of power in the hands of the man leading the unconventional war, so similar to current events. The Ostia raid will call to mind 9/11, as well as the line from the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes (1.9) about there being "nothing new under the sun."   When Quintus later complained about the ingratitude of Pompey, who never answered Cicero's letters to him, Cicero in Harris' novel says with fatalism: "If it is gratitude you want, get a dog," a statement expressing a similar view by Harry Truman about a politician seeking a friend in Washington, DC.[... 
 You definitly should read this if you dont you are missing out .....! 
 This book gives very good information when referencing for APA format. I am in an MBA program and this book has helped me when I had a question as to the correct writing style for APA 
  Would "Caligula" or "Nero" be shocked at what their city, the Eternal City, has become so many years into the distant future? Or would they (probably more likely) find themselves fitting right in somehow? This is one of the notions that I found myself pondering as I watched this movie. It really is a great movie, and it is certainly worth any true film fan's time. I may have even liked (some of it at least) better than (again, some of) La Dolce Vita.    Having grown up in an Italian family - my father was born in a "pagliarone" ( roughly, slang dialect term meaning "stone hut") in an ancient and very rural village in Molise - I myself was definitely right at home , so to speak, watching scenes like the famous "dinner on the piazza". (Personally I could watch that scene again and again and not get tired of it, but...maybe it is "an Italian thing", so to speak, and others would not find it so amusing).  However there certainly is no dearth of general humour to be found in the antics of the wild cast of characters which Fellini always brings into his films. And Roma of course is no exception to this. For example the bedridden obese old woman in a hairnet, who owns the building that he stays in in Rome when he first arrives in Rome, who tells him, "now let's just live in peace and not bust each other's balls"!  Or the bald old man who does a rather convincing Mussolini impersonation.  My personal favorite though would probably be the ultra-tanned "Continental" type of guy who approaches the female American tourist the second she gets off the bus, telling her, "You VERY bella" and offering to take her picture for her.  Or the young man in the piazza scene (which is supposed to have taken place some thirty years prior) who is wearing a gold medallion and one of those black nylon "do-rags" (the kind that rap stars wear today), yelling up to his dark beautiful brooding girlfriend to get down to the piazza before he throws her off the balcony.  Sure these are walking stereotypes, these characters, and negative ones at that.   But, as they say, there is a kernel of truth (at least) in all stereotypes is there not? For instance the entire "dinner on the piazza" scene, any Italian or Italian-American must admit, does definitely resemble some sort of "prototypical" pre-emigration summer-night-in-Bensonhurst or some place like that, with plenty of gold chains, "dago-t's", and "pane e vino" to go around.      On a more serious note however the most touching scene (and this is a point that is usually generally agreed upon I think by most of the movie's fans) is the scene of the sudden (and apparently accidental) destruction of the ancient Roman frescoes by the modern work-crew. Obviously this is Fellini's artistic condemnation , if you will, of the massive industrialization of the City in modern times, and the (clearly potentially disastrous) effects of what we may call the "godless modern" encountering the ancient and sacred. Cruel and loud machinery encountering the long-buried, the "resting-in-peace", the "sacred".  Such imagery, like Fellini's vision of the vanishing ancient frescoes, is so evocative it can truly make the viewer want to weep.     Athough Rome has improved much since Fellini filmed it back in 1972, in this film, during both of the time periods that he shows it to us, the City appears to have been delusional. Vaguely delirious with fever perhaps. Or in the throes of a long restless night full of tossings-and-turnings and wild "half-waking" dreams. And it is these dreams that in fact constitute the "images" and "vignettes" that Fellini shows to us throughout the film.          
 Wisdom of the past has transcended time and is true today as it was 700 years ago.  Verses are easy to memorize and the book could be like a bible by your night table.  Too bad that not all of Khayyam's poetry in this book 
 For IT professionals looking to understand more about how projects were run in the 70s (to compare that with how projects are run today), this book is great. A fine read. The key thing here is that although the technology has changed since the 70s, the management and team structures depicted in _The Soul of a New Machine_ could be in place today. For better or worse. This book should be read by any IT professional who is looking to be part of a technical product team. If only to better understand technical team dynamics 
 I've read the book and it's hard hitting and very close to the truth.  Today I saw Tim Carney with CSPAN's book review.  Very interesting and this is a book that should be on your reading list for the month.  However, Tim is dealing with the obvious SYMPTOMS of corruption and collusion on the part of government and big business.  The real CAUSE is deeper.  As a companion book to this I would HIGHLY suggest reading G. Edward Griffin's: Creature from Jekyll Island.  Then you will find out the cause. But congratulations to Tim for helping expose "The Ripoff" to the American Taxpayer.  Nothing like using the middle class to have CEO's Million Dollar salaries subsidized by the overtaxed American worker, including small business owners. After the reader has read these two books they need to start asking some deep questions and take action.  That means getting involved politically and sadly it's not with our two, bought and paid for political parties anymore. Wait until the reader finds out this coupe occured almost a hundred years ago and is now beginning to strangle the nation economically, morally and now imperils our civil liberties.  
 I first read this book about twenty years ago.  I am glad to see that there is a new edition.  It had a major impact on my development as an artist. The author discusses the trend called "conceptual art"  which flowered in the time period mentioned in the title (late 60's through  early 70's).  These artists rejected the craft of art and the creation of  objects themselves seeking instead something more fundamental.  Ms. Lippard  calls this "resonance" and uses descriptions of various pieces to  explore this concept.  Though "conceptual art" has long since  passed by, the analysis in this book is still current and applies more than  ever in our "post-modernist" period 
 The "dean" of traditional, historical critical commentaries. Focuses on determining the form and sources of each passage. In addition to verse by verse commentary, it includes essays on current Lucan studies, Lucan theology, and other topics. This work has a deserved reputation for being careful and thorough. However, it was written before the rise of literary critical approaches, and it can come off now as a bit dry and unsatisfying. It woud be hard to write a sermon, for example, just using this. Use it as the foundation, but add another work. Still belongs in any serious library. 
 This is an exhilarating read. It makes a great engagement gift. Makes the planning of any wedding more organized, fun,and gives it a form regardless of whether you are Irish or not.If you are Irish it is all here for you. Will make you proud to know your roots 
 This was one of my college text books- I was an equine science major.  It's probably the most comprehensive guide to horse nutrition and feeding practices ever written so far.  It discusses different vitamin and mineral deficiencies and excess with photographs of horses suffering from these imbalances, teaches you how to calculate the nutritional needs of horses of various ages and activity levels, types of feed and hay, types of pastureland.  The color section on poisonous plants is especially helpful.  The book is very information intensive, but I found all of the information to be extremely useful and applicable.  I retained a lot of information from this book, which I don't always do with textbooks!  I think anyone who keeps their own horses or manages a stable would greatly benefit to reading this book 
 These 5 CD's can be used to help you relax, or can be used to encourage creativity, or just to give you the feeling that your some place else.  The waves could have been more intense, needs more "boom" when the waves crash, but otherwise the CD's are very realistic.  And the price is excellent!  I would recommend these 
 Another quality product from Mr. Knopfler. Saw the tour so this make a great souvenir. Mark and Emmylou, not a finer duo around 
 Product arrived in good condition.  Now I can bake 1 dozen doughnuts at 1 time.  This is my second pan 
 This is a super book.  It communicates well and is very effective.  I have had chronic back, hip and feet pain for many years.  This book is teaching me how to use my body correctly, which is something I don't think most people realize they don't know how to do - I sure didn't, even though I have been through yoga and dance training.  The book is not glamorous and not for coffee table reading.  It's more the book you can throw into your suitcase or backpack and take with.  It's a book for USE and it WORKS.  I feel physically better than in many years, my hips and back and feet are improving daily.   This is more or less an operating manual for the body's structure.  Thank you so much to the authors for making this information available in an easily assimilatable form. :- 
 This book is a real treasure.  The recipes are delicious and very detailed and easy to follow.  I have made several of these cookies and every batch has turned out great.  This book would be worth buying for the Snickerdoodle recipe alone.  By far the best I have tasted!  I just used the basic sugar cookie recipe for Christmas cutouts and again they were far better than recipes I have used in the past.  Can't wait to try some more 
 Good as a reference but not something you pick up everyday. Very good as a reference, however 
 The illustrations in this book are very helpful. The language, for the most part, is understandable to an amateur but in some cases, gets rather technical and assumes one has some prior knowledge that an amateur would not have. It is pretty extensive and comprehensive and a worthwhile purchase especially if one can get a decent used copy. Safety tips are helpful, too. Overall, a good, useful and worthwhile purchase for the homeowner 
 I started listening to As I lay Dying in 2005 and I think this is terrific stuff. I would like to know who tagged this as "gay", because this is awesome. I suggest the chucklehead who tagged this as "gay" stick with listening to hip-hop, R&B, and pop. as far as metalcore goes, this is a band that refuses to compromise. as far as "new" stuff goes, I have never heard their EP's or their debut full-length album, so it sounds pretty new to me. I give this album 5 halos. (this is Christian metal 
 Haslett's collection immediately brings to mind Lydia Davis' Break It Down, how each tale is of the intricate relationship between two people and the often harrowing world in which these delicate bonds are made. Haslett, however, has an inimitable knack for building the most unlikely relationships and, by extension, the most unique stories. An aging, manic inventor tries to reconcile the severed relationship with his son; a high school boy admits to himself that he's "the only kid at his school who gets his romantic advice from a schizophrenic"; a brother and sister, living together, alone, await a visit from a man they both once loved twenty years before. Nothing is as it seems - even a man's hometown, draped with those typical childhood memories, is punctuated with grief:  Emptier still, the train moves on, past the tennis courts and baseball fields where Daniel played as a child, past the supermarket here he bagged groceries after school and the police station where he and his mother used to file the missing person reports.  But Haslett's stories are beautiful even in their harshest moments, as they bear with them an overwhelming emotional intensity. The normal lives of his characters are ultimately shattered by loss or the realization of its inevitability. So often the characters end up exhausted, faces in hands, at the end of a long journey of reconciliation - and in doing so, the stories also show great promise and hope in the human spirit 
 This interesting new text posits a new tenant to realism, namely that above anarchy lies the great powers and their interest in using coercive action to bring other states into weakness and increase their wealth and power. Realism is the school of thought that has been best explicated by Henry Kissinger in his book `Diplomacy'.  This is an add on, sure to be the new standard text in the field.  Here we deal in general with the politics of Great Powers, principally in the modern era, and this book sets out its theory predicting a new war in Europe, and castigating America for engaging(positively) with China.  A very interesting, slightly dry text, perfect for political science aficionados.  Seth J. Frantzman 
 Yet another favorite recording by this mega- talented band. A great coming- of- age saga filled with some of the best music put down on vinyl (or whatever substance!) Excellent musicianship by all involved, some of the deepest songwriting, highly emotional. The song "The Real Me" is one of my favorite of ALL time, elevating John Entwistle into my top 3 picks for bass legends (his performance here is smokin'!) This song also could have been an autobiographical sketch for me at the time. I can relate! I guess that's the great thing about The Who is that they wrote songs at the fans' level. Although I hugely love music by Yes and Rush, their lyrics were not always ones I could necessarily relate to, although I absorbed them quite well! Pete Townshend is a working- class genious, not exactly pandering to the masses by writing what was popular, but what was really happening with youth at the time. God bless ye, Pete! Sometimes, however, when people write about "their generation," they tend to lose some inteletuality. Not this band! Very thoughtful ,incisive lyrics have usually been The Who's forte. And the music..... These guys have to be the TIGHTEST rock band ever! You will by no means regret purchasing this recording if you enjoy ROCK music, period! End of transmission... 
 this book is what you need if you want to defend yourself against a knife,bayonet,stick or unarmed attack and there is also a small course of knife throwing at the end of the book.it's easy to learn by heart and pactice,you will be able to kill someone if it is necessary(ever in a knife or a bayonet match!).Mr Styers is considered the chief of the 4th generation of knife fighters after mr Bowie!He knows what he do and the information in this book will save your bottom in life-or-death situations! buy the book,only if you really want to strangle your opponent with one hand!have pity for him 
 i first saw this movie after seeing Ocean's Eleven starring George Clooney, and I thought nothing could be better than that. However, when my parents sat me down to watch the Sting, i fuond out every movie that has anything to do with cons came out of that one.   The Sting, starring the dynamic duo Paul Newman and Robert Redford, is about revenge for the death of a collegue. Newman is the one who knows all the tricks, and Redford is the one trying to learn them. The whole movie is full of twists and turns that make it so much more enjoyable than any other con movie. Winner of several Academy Awards, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good tricks that makes stealing look like it's fun. 
 The popularity of African American same gender loving (SGL) fiction in this new century owes much to the wordsmiths of the previous one hundred years. Twentieth century black lesbian, gay and bisexual authors of fiction began writing in codes as complex as underground railroad communiqué, stepped tepidly out of the closet during the Harlem Renaissance, sought Eurohomocentric inclusion as late as the early 1990's, then burst out in full proud Africentric glory in the last half dozen years prior to the new millennium.  Black Like Us charts this evolution deftly. Although its editors-college professors and editors of works that meditate the writings of Huey P. Newton, Gore Vidal and Bayard Rustin-suggest a work heavy on academics, Black Like Us goes beyond its inferred pedigree.  From the turn-of-the-twentieth century writings of color-conscious Alice Dunbar-Nelson (Paul Lawrence Dunbar's lesbian ex-wife) to the unselfconscious pride and Africentricity of major SGL contemporary celebrities E. Lynn Harris, James Earl Hardy, and Marci Blackman, we are treated to 36 fascinating biographical sketches, each followed by telling writing samples.  Richard Bruce Nugent, the most identifiably gay writer of the Harlem Renaissance, is aptly represented by an excerpt from his hauntingly beautiful "Smoke, Lilies, and Jade" (1925) while Baldwin is wisely showcased by an excerpt from "Another Country" (1962) instead of the obvious "Giovanni's Room."  Langston Hughes' 1963 short story "Blessed Assurance" is a joyful glimpse into the life of a `brilliant queer' church boy while E. Lynn Harris breaks ground and gives voice to contemporary closeted and "questioning" African American gay and bisexual men who strive for self-acceptance in an excerpt from his debut novel "Invisible Life" (1991).  The works and lives of Alice Walker, Countee Cullen, Audre Lorde, Melvin Dixon, Thomas Glave, Jewelle Gomez, and Shay Youngblood, to name a few, are tightly presented in 555 potent pages.  Although a book as ambitious as this should be applauded for its rich historical, cultural and anecdotal detail, the omission of Penny Mickelbury, noted contemporary lesbian author of 8 popular out-of-the-closet crime novels, is glaring and baffling.  Nonetheless the SGL 36 showcased here, their carefully selected literary samples, and their equally as fascinating lives and times, comprise a work both vital and entertaining.  This is a bookshelf requisite for both hetero- and homosexual appreciators of Black Literature and culture in deference or even indifferent to sexual nature. It will gather little dust.  
 The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting to get different results.  We learn of Eddie, Mae, their father, and a "Man" (Martin) coming for a date blind to the status of the  relationship of his date and her brother and their father.  I am a Senior  at Lindenwood University in St. Charles Missouri, double majoring in  Theatre and Mass Communications.  This April, I will be directing  "Fool For Love" as my senior project.  This play, as analyzed in  a previous modern drama class and in my current working analysis, is highly  identifiable with anyone who has ever been involved in a severely  dysfunctional relationship that won't go away. Mr. Shepard creates  four  intricate and powerful characters sharing both realistic and ethereal  existances.    
 Two expert behavior analysts have produced a very fine work that should be a fixture on every behavioral programmer's shelf.  Written in a style that will be easily understood by professional and layperson alike, Weiss and Harris systematically lay out considerations and plans for helping students diagnosed with autistic-spectrum disorders to develop social skills and move towards mainstream activities.  The task can seem daunting.  Where do you begin to help students to develop social skills?  Begin with this book 
 Can be used for an in depth analysis of cultural norms around the world, or can be extremely handy as a quick reference before an important business trip or meeting.  This book will put you one step ahead 
 Karas was a masterpeice. Anime at it's finest. It made me angry though. The ending, supposed to be a cliff hanger (since it is a supposed series), wasn't very good at all. The animation style was excellent and voice acting was spot on.  So far, the second best animated movie this year, only surpassed by FF7: Advent Children 
 I wish I knew why this book is so hard to find.  All Eric Carle books are great, especially this one!  No words in this book, just his beautiful pictures -- a song in paint!  When my daughter was only a couple of months old, she was interested in everything, but this book really held her attention.  Get a hardback copy if you can find one -- paper just won't hold up to a baby's abuse 
 In the months following this horrific events, Americans have proved that they can be easily controlled by fear and more than eager to give up freedoms to be free. Americans need to take a hard look of how they have allowed america to desintigrate by the hands of an illegitimate president, because Bush has garanteed america many more 9/11s by his illegal war in Iraq  wake up America before you find yourself in a dictatorship   
 I have all of Draco's cds including Maggie's Dream and Songbirds & Roosters is my favorite of them all especially the title song the way he weaves his words telling his story you can really feel what he is feeling.You can almost picture the stories he's telling as he wails his soul out for everyone to share

 It is a text book vs a simple reading book, however the author has done an excellent job of presenting the concepts in simple to understand format.  With well writtem text and informative graphs the concepts easy to  understand.  Covers all types in investments instruments from stocks,  bonds, options, futures and portfolio construction 
 Used by my son at school.  He said that it is pretty good and his teacher reccomends it 
 Reading Alan Furst's latest offering was like a taking a journey with a good friend. I have read all of his books, and Mr. Furst never fails to make me feel as though I am living in the Europe that he writes about and that I am part of the lives and the conversations of his well-drawn characters. Along with the tension he creates there is also a certain gemutlichkeit, of being at home and comfortable with those who populate his novels and the country where they reside. Many positive things have been written about this book, all of them true.  Mr. Furst, however, is the only American author who can write about love-making without making this reader yawn and think:  Oh, here is another adolescent, gratuitous, jump-your-bones scene. The love-making is adult, erotic and beautiful.   Looking forward to the next one.  
 Limbaugh has got to be the most unfairly lambasted public figure of our time.  Even to listen to his show automatically gets you placed as a brainwashed radical who can't think for himself and gets all of his talking points from the radio.  This happens even though most of the people who dismiss Rush and his listeners so readily never even take the time to sit down and listen to him, but just get their opinions from the media or from word of mouth.  Rush is actually one of the more center-leaning of the talk show hosts and uses sound reasoning and strong personal convictions in his decision making.  While he does fight for what he believes in and I'm sure a lot of libs think he is straight-up radical, most of what they hear that really pisses them off the worst is him just trying to be funny.  He entertains on his show by joking about leftists and their political leaders (sometimes cruelly) and by acting absurdly cocky, but most of it is just to keep an audience.    In this first book of his, Rush writes eloquently about the current events and state of affairs in the early 1990s.  It is interesting to me that most of the same debates are still alive and well today, more than 10 years later.  Neither the left nor the right has changed its tune much in the last decade, and the country is still struggling with the same problems even though we've had periods of both liberal and conservative leadership.  To me, this indicates that the constant division and bickering between the two sides of the political spectrum ends up causing a stalemate in which neither side is willing to give an inch and in fact will sabatoge efforts by the other side, even if the ideas are good.  I'm sure this runs both ways, but as a Republican it is hard not to see most of this coming from the leff (seems like every single idea or agenda Bush has is immediately beaten down by the Dems).  Anyway, Rush is a smart and funny guy who you'll find you love if you give him a chance.  
 Perhaps Ajami's best:  a legendary (and, for some, inconveniently seminal) text in the field of Middle Eastern studies and Arab psychology.  The basic thesis is that the hopelessness of modern Arabs (in such fields as medicine, politics, education, economics -- even warfare) stems from their insistence on perceiving and, in turn, constructing their reality out of words, out of rhetoric, out of the incantatory and soothing effect of flowery or mystical verbiage, rather than out of the zillions of nagging and undeniable clues that the external world keeps jabbing them with.  It's a lot more interesting than I'm making it sound, though 
 A delightful little movie based on a series of delightful little children's stories (with, maybe, a bit more bite than the average fare).  Of course, it won't be for everyone.  A Series of Unfortunate Events is about the three Baudelaire orphans who are shuttled from foster home to foster home pursued by the evil Count Olaf. A laughable, over-the-top villain determined to capture the orphans' family fortune.  This movie takes the first three novels of the series (purported to be 13 books in all, plus an "autobiography" of the "author") and blends them wonderfully into one tale (sticking the 2nd and 3rd into the middle of the first book). It brings the tales to life with delightful scenery and excellent casting. Jim Carrey brings Olaf to life. And, YES, he is "overacting" but he is absolutely true to the character in the books. He is perfect in his role. Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep have great turns as well.  If you're a fan of these books, you likely won't be disappointed. If you've never read them, you may like this movie too, just know that it's a little stylized and "over the top." In the end, it's a lot of fun, and not that's not such an unfortunate thing in a film 
 Silly and fun. Every child will love the story about poor Jonathan who couldn't clean his room thanks to the crowds of people leaving the subway station that was magically connected to it. The illustrations are  wonderfully rendered 
 This book is great! As a working Mom I don't have the time to spend hours in a store searching for the appropriate toys, books, DVD's, etc... for my nieces, nephews, and birthday gifts for my son's friends.  I've every edition since 2001 and it has never failed to please.  The added bonuses are the great safety tips and smart parent tricks. I also love OTP's "Read It! Play It!" 
 I got my copy today... and roared through the pages and images... Beautiful and fascinating images of Malibu's past... Paradise Cove in 1890, the Malibu Ranch, The Adamson House. So many interesting stories and images... and lives! And... some great surf shots too. This is a perfect blend of the many lifestyles here in Malibu... all in one book. Educational and informative and with some good humor too. I know what I'm giving for Christmas presents now 
 Oh my god! I love this song "Believe"! I just ordered my copy for 1. At a price like that, it's hard to resist. "Believe" has the best bumpin house lyrics, with those smooth intoxicating lyrics from one of the most gifted song writers and lyricists of all time, Cher. I usually listen to this song on repeat while I'm cleaning my room. I just hate it when my little sister or my mom comes in my room while I'm cleaning, cuz sometimes they see things they don't want to see. Even though I constantly tell them not to disturb me while I'm cleaning my room 
 When I looked at ACO on Amazon there were 589 existing reviews. What more can be said. It is a "real horrorshow" read. This is Burgess' finest work. It is short and very readable. We have ultra violence and an excellent exploration of what is a world gone wrong. It is a kind of "Cather in the Rye" meets "American Psycho" set in the beta part of "Brave New World"  Although engaged in assult, murder, rape Alex and his pals are somehow engaging. Their future speak slang has not aged at all and has a cool feels (its baaaad). The lingo is addictive - it is very engaging to learn the lingo - tocchock, horrorshow, groodies, veck and many more.  Recommend it to all who are angst riven - Not 
 It was quite obvious that my subordinates didn't respect me, after I received my promotion to manager.  I was set to give up entirely until this wonderful book fell into my lap as a gift from my beautiful wife of 20 years.  Not long after reading, the snotty little brat of a file clerk disappeared suddenly after a brief trip on my boat. A few months later, the executive assistant who was forever tardy and spent all day doing her nails disappeared suddenly and unexplainably during a business trip to Maine.  I'm planning on using the skills I picked up from this fantastic book on Greg from Accounting, but I must first find where I put my bowling bag.  It's incredible just how much respect I get now 
 This item is not made in France, but made in Thailand. The lid is NOT tight fitting, quite the opposite really. Still the pot looks nice, and is a good size for one or two person stews 
 A quick read for anyone who enjoys catching a few "Strippahs" from their local haunts.  Billy has certainly mastered the art of catching the big ones, but it also comes at a price - Fishing is 1st - everything else, I mean everything else comes after.  Catching 2,500 fish with a rod during a slow season was mind boggling to me, I had to do the math twice and was sure there was an extra zero in the numbers, but low and behold this guy is a true master of the species.  It was an inspiration to read and even got me up in the middle of the nite to go for the cows under a full moon and a high tide - I got skunked and humbled.  A great gift with some terrific photos 
 A "Cliff Notes" version of some of the top marketing books published.  If you can't read all of the titles individually, this summary compilation makes for a good thought provoking start 
 Very cute movie and a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  Set in Britain, you have Jess, a teenage girl of Indian descent, keenly interested in playing soccer (or football in Britain) and very good at soccer as well! She idolizes British soccer player David Beckham and dreams of one day becoming a professional player herself! Unfortunately, her parents are very traditional and don't want her playing soccer as girls of her age should no longer be interested in playing sports.  Jess secretly joins a girl's soccer team after being spotted by another female soccer player, Juliet, who helps recruit Jesse to play for her team. Jess's parents don't approve, but Jess decides to play on the team anyway and not tell her parents anything about being on the team.  Jess excels at playing soccer, enjoys playing soccer as it is her passion, and becomes fast friends with the girls on her team as well as her coach. She also does a lot of funny things in order not to be caught playing on an all girl's soccer team by her parents, but still gets caught anyway. It doesn't help that the coach for the team is a male!  Pros: Cute, funny movie, with great storyline about friendship, family, love, and finding the inner strength be fight for what you believe in and following your dream.  Cons: Predictable. Hard at times to follow the British accents and British slang 
 When Brian was just thirteen years-old, he was struck with the worst thing that could probably happen to a boy of his age; he gets stranded out in the middle of the Canadian forest.  With nowhere to go Brian must learn to live on his own until someone comes to find him and with that he is faced with things he just can't go through but he stands tall and goes through everything thing that comes past him making him have "tough hope"  By Logan & Brandolandodingdong  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book they just can't put it down book of an astonishing survival.   I give this book 5 out of 5 because Gary Paulsen gets his reader involved in the book and also he knows how to get the reader anxious to read on and keep the pages turning. 
 If you have read any "diet" books from the past 10 years, and then attempted in vain to follow the advice in those books, you will really enjoy and appreciate reading the Cortisol Connection Diet.  For starters, it's a very "easy read".  It's as though you are listening to a casual conversation from a friend.  The information is presented in a logical and easy to follow manner.  I read the book cover to cover on a short plane ride.  There were two particular aspects of the book that I thought were very unique and extremely helpful.  First are the highlights at the end of each chapter.  I have found myself on numerous occasions, going back to the book, reviewing the chapter highlights and quickly getting the information I was looking for.  Secondly, the sample menu plans and daily logs at the end of the book were great!  I would put this on anyone's "must read list" 
 hey everyboyd i have to agree with the last reviewer...the original pressing sounds much better and is definately worth owning. if you wanna pick up a copy and not have to spend 35 bucks like you would on this site just gimme a shout sometime i have that cd along with a number of other great punk cd's for sale at ridiculous low prices. talk to you soon.

 I've given this book and the others in the series as gifts to a number of new parents, and the grown-ups love love love them 
   The reason why I like the movie Colors, are for these reasons.  It has great actors, it shows a great deal of violence, and it's full of that street/prison reality of how gangs really do operate.  The only other movies that can compare are Bound By Honor:Blood In Blood Out(Benjamin Bratt), and American Me(Edward James Olmos).   Sean Penn as the new rookie cop, learning the hard way of how these streets really work.  Plays a great character who's just trying to do what he thinks is right.  An excellent movie for Penn to do right after At Close Range(Christopher Walken), and right before Casualties of War(Michael J. Fox).   Robert Duvall plays one of the best cops/detectives you can see in movies.  Later going on to do future cop roles in movies such as Falling Down(Michael Douglas), and John Q(Denzel Washington).  Whatever movie Duvall is in, when he talks... you really do listen.   Maria Conchita Alonso best known for the leading actress in the two action thrillers The Running Man(Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and Predator 2(Danny Glover).  Gives a smaller acting job, that just helps support this cast even further.   Dennis Hopper as a director, that I don't know.  His only other movie that he directed which was good was Easy Rider(Peter Fonda).  Hopper as an actor is still the best with his suspense and humor.  If you like the way Hopper thinks, Colors is the best film to watch... even if he ain't in it.   The violence, the little action, and dozens of characters all do keep this story going.  You even have cameo roles by actors such as Don Cheadle(Hotel Rwanda), and Damon Wayans(The Last Boy Scout).   Overall... liked the movies Bound By Honor, American Me... like Penn like Duvall... then watch this movie, it's really a good late 80's flick about two partners in L.A. right in the middle of a gang war 
 This LeapPad book is perfect for children fascinated with dinosaurs!  Packed with fascinating facts to make your little one an expert on dinosaurs 
 A sea of works imagining themselves as "biographies" of King David have made an appearance of late, mostly the works of non-scholars who ranging from mediocre to execrable.  As a group, these tend to fit into the take a character from the Bible and put them on the couch approach, a fate suffered first by Moses and now by Israel's second king.  From that morass comes this fine book, by thoughtful and able biblical scholar Baruch Halpern, one which should be read by any interested in the field.  Halpern neither seeks to bury David nor to praise him.  Instead, he takes a textual approach, examining Samuel carefully and often in comparison with the royal accounts of other contemporaneous Levantine kingdoms.  Thus, instead of taking the rather sophomoric and ultimately useless method of holding a 3,000 year old character up to ridicule and condemnation based on modern ethical notions, Halpern examines King David within his own literary idiom.  Some may find this a less than thrilling read, but it accomplishes a useful goal.  Thus, we can understand what parts of David's record count as his successes and where, following the style particular to his time, the text is covering for his failures.  Of course it is not David's military or foreign accomplishments that render him for many a subject of such great interest, but instead his personal and political life which, as so often proves true among royals, proved so intertwined as to be a single rope.  To the end of untangling this knotty subject, Halpern again reads the text closely and makes many logical assumptions leading to interesting, if often disquieting theories.  Readers inclined to take Samuel as gospel, pardon the pun, will find their blood pressure rising at many suggestions offered, but then again, even the most cursory reading of Samuel demonstrates that David can hardly be seen as a paragon of virtue.  However, unlike Mckenzie's "biography," which portrayed Saul's successor as a sociopath with a gift for music, sort of a cross between Ted Bundy and Marc Cohn, Halpern renders an image of David for what he likely was, a late bronze/early iron age leader using the acceptable means of his day to consolidate power and strengthen his kingdom.  Readers may have an easier time accepting some of Halpern's conclusions then others.  That David's enemies seem to time and again suffer violent deaths even as the text over and over again insists that he is blameless makes it easy to believe that the Book of Samuel "doth deny too much."  His assertion that the relationship between David and Jonathan is a fiction to strengthen David's claim to the throne, while also logical, lacks the same strength of argument.  Another presentation of a scholarly theory currently of high currency, that David's whole Tribe of Judah are of late constitution and not part of the original Tribal confederacy presented in the Bible, will upset many, but even those rejecting this argument should at least be able to admit that it is interesting.  Rather than taking the churlish approach of simply throwing up ones hands and rejecting these ideas because "the bible doesn't say so" readers should try and attempt to look at the evidence and undermine the argument on its own terms.    No matter ones personal religious stripe, Professor Halpern has produced a thoughtful and scholarly work, one worthy of deep consideration and analysis.  Those interested in the subject who let them selves be put off by its often thick prose and occasional digressions will regret their failure to explore "David's Secret Demons." 
 Great photos in this book and at a great price.  Very happy with the book and customer service from amazon.  I will buy again!!!! 
 For nearly 25 years Chanticleer has performed a large and wide variety of music, from Gregorian Chant to the most modern fare.  With its seamless blend of 12 male voices,ranging from counter-tenor to bass, the ensemble has earned international renown as "an orchestra of voices". Chanticleer was founded in 1978 by tenor Louis Botto, and was named after the 'clear-singing' rooster in Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales'. This CD offers a wide variety of choral gems, some well-known; some traditional;some in French, in German; most in English.  But all of them are performed with great skill as well as exquisite tone quality.  Dawn Upshaw is an added plus on this disc. Just commenting on a few of them that captured my interest: "A Christmas Round"/"Today The Virgin". Sir John Tavener joined the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977 which had a tremendous impact on his compositions.  The brief text for 'A Christmas Round' is from the Orthodox Liturgy for Christmas Day.  'Today the Virgin' is a strophic setting of a text by Mother Thekla, an Orthodox nun, who has provided him with the libretti for several of his major works.  In typical Russian Orthodox style, a drone is employed in the bass, and the upper voices move in parallel fifths and octaves. "Es ist ein Ros entsprungen" (Lo, How an ever-blooming rose).Hugo Distler combines an extensive use of rediscovered forms and genres,and a very effective use of word-paintings in his music.   Based on the famous tune of the same name, his setting resembles a fantasia,finally submerging the theme in rhythmic complexity as the number of voice parts expands from 4 to as many as 8.  The text for the soprano that is laid over verse 3 is taken from the 'Magnificat' (Luke I:46-55). "Die Stimme des Kindes" (The voice of the child)  Finnish composer,Jaako Mantyjarvi adopts influences from a number of styles and periods, fusing them into his own idiom.  This gently-rocking setting for eight-part men's chorus uses lush tone clusters to impart a late- Romantic sentiment. This album is a thinking-man's joy!!!!We all love the familiar carols, but it's so refreshing to hear some new ones.  This group is certainly reminiscent of the "King's Singers" who preceded them; both excellent in every way!!! 
 The last days of the Clintons were an occasion for the country to witness just how corrupt this two for the price of one team actually was. They took furniture and gifts that were not their's for the taking, and appeared to be granting pardons on the basis of what law breakers held the most influence within their circle of friends and family. From arsenic to Mark Rich, the whole squalid tale is recounted by the superlative Barbara Olso, who sadly is no longer with us. 
 Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story is a great story of one of the greatest bands ever! RHCP!!!  They are 100 times more interesting and talented than those dopey boys from Liverpool, the Beatles 
 There aren't too many "fair and balanced" opinions out there on Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and GW Bush.  This book on Reagan by Pemberton comes as close as most to some semblance of objectivity.  No book comes close to the quality and objectivity of a recent president as does Cannon's "President Reagan: Role of a Lifetime."  But Pemberton does a fine job in covering Reagan's entire life in a small number of pages (214 of text).    I used the book in an American government class and I thought it was readable for the students and told the larger story of the 20th century.  Reagan's life, whether one agreed with him or not, in many ways represented the story of the 20th century.  After WWII, the nation embraced FDR and his policies.  In time, with the Great Society and the rise of anti-communism, the nation stepped away from the liberal label.  Contrary to what many on the right believe, the nation never embraced conservatism to the same degree it embraced the New Deal, but changes did occurred.  And the end of the Cold War was another huge event.  The left and right will always argue over the impact Reagan had on the end of the Cold War, but Pemberton did well in presenting the many different theories.  He also was quite fair in analyzing Reagan's budget and tax policies, which are also still debated today 
 My "happy" marriage was failing and I had no clue as to why. Both this book and "The Power of a Praying Wife" opened my eyes and truly revealed to me what I had been doing wrong for so many years.  This was a book that I couldn't put down, but also at times, had a hard time reading because I felt it was leading me to take on a role that would lose myself to me.  But it's a book full of biblical truth and has truly transformed me into a stronger woman who's marriage now has hope when there was none.  I'm a better woman for it and feel I truly am serving God by being the kind of wife the bible teaches us to be, rather than a wife that society has created.  I am a Godly wife, my family is intact and the man I love is still my husband, my marriage is blessed.  This book taught me and transformed my life.  I haven't lost who I am at all, I am better and much more blessed because of it 
 Ghost Canoe is about a fourteen-year-old boy named Nathan MacAllister. After the ship named the Burnaby sunk, no one thought there were any survivors, though there were footprints, stolen goods, and a murdered captain. Nathan thought otherwise. After a series of events, he realizes that the murderer was actually in the village and that a sole survivor existed.  At the end of the book, Kane, the survivor, died because of his greed for a treasure he was pursuing the entire time. I loved this book because it is great historical fiction novel, it is exciting, and it is a mystery.  	  	This book is a historical fiction novel because it describes the history and geography of the Pacific Northwest.  It outlines information on the Indian tribes that live near the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  It also describes what it was like to live in the unsettled area of  Washington state during the late 1800`s.  The area was mainly populated by Indians and a few pioneers of that era.  The lighthouse on Tatoosh Island, near the strait, is the setting for the story. It was refurbished in 1874 to attract a family to keep the light burning, which is where Nathan's father worked.  It still stands today.  	This book is very exciting and kept my attention.  I wondered if there were any survivors from the shipwreck.  After learning a survivor existed, I wondered why he killed the captain and remained in the area.  When a letter, from the captain's brother, hinted at a treasure, I realized why the survivor stayed in the village.  A man matching Kane's description was mentioned in the letter.  Nathan realizes the man is Kane after talking with his dad.  Kane is well known shop owner in the village, who is not trusted by the Indians.  Kane discovered the treasure and died at the end of the book because he puts his greed before his safety.  	I enjoyed Ghost Canoe because there is a mystery within the story.  It kept me guessing from the first page until the last.  It was full of lots of twists and turns.  I really enjoyed how the identity of Kane was not revealed until later in the book.  The story built as the book progressed to an ending I was not expecting.  I could read the book again and find a clue I missed the first time.  	I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to others.  Nathan is close to my age and the book gave me an idea of what it was like to live back then.  The book was set on the West Coast, and I was able to imagine what the area might look like.  I also found it interesting to read about the local Indians and their way of life.  I thought it was neat that the lighthouse is still there today.  Ghost Canoe is a fast paced book that is easy to read.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.  Lastly, it is a great account about the history of the expansion of our country and how the west was settled. By: C. Copeland     
 Although I am overall satisfied with the knife, the appearance is somewhat disproportionate feeling. What I mean is that at first glance, the main locking blade seems a little dainty, slim, and frail; but upon further inspection you will see that the blade is plentiful thick and the metal "feels" strong and hardened well. I attribute this to a simple design oversight that pairs the new curvy body with the old straight blade design. Some curve and design in the main blade, which the new one-handed opening eyelet designed knives by Victorinox implement, would make the overall feel more satisfying to the eye.  Overall construction has a well designed feel that is expected with Victorinox but I am not sure that a locking bottle opener is totally necessary, even if the large flat screwdriver head is on that tool. The blade is razor sharp right out of the box and feels good to hold in your hand. A sheath would have been a nice addition, even if it meant to add a couple bucks to the price, but that might just have to be an aftermarket purchase for those requiring one.  For the price, this knife is a great buy! 
 I bought this book for over $16 at Borders when it caught my eye.  Look what you save buying it here!  I don't regret it, though, the book is THAT good.  Each recipe shows the ingredients in photographs, laid out in series:     photo of canned product, such as tomato)  + this (photo of another canned product) + this (photo of meat or veggie) = (photo of the finished meal)  Ingenious.  No more wondering, am I buying the right kind of canned tomatoes for this recipe?    The first thing I made was Paella.  It was done in under 1/2 hour and the leftovers tasted (incredibly) even better the second day.    I'm a working mom, cooking for my husband (DH) & 2 pre-teenagers who are into all sorts of activities.  Although I love to cook gourmet meals, my family could be starving before such fare is ready.  These are fast, tasty, and have child-and-husband-friendly-ingredients.  I've saved out a portion and microwaved it fast for DH when he has had a late work night and usually I'm too cooked out to do that.  And the cleanup is next-to-nothing, getting me out of the kitchen and not having to face a disaster of a kitchen when we get back from evening activities.  We had the turkey with stuffing last night... the kids actually bragged to their friends about that dinner-- and it was so easy.  As if all this weren't enough, I think I'm saving $ too, because I'm not resorting to fast food because I'm too tired to think about what to make.  It's that easy to have the ingredients on hand for these meals. 
 If you use CallManager Express with Cisco Unity Express this book will be a godsend for you 
 Wonderful, and adaptable to the abilities of different ages (from 6 and up for us).  Love it 
 What I really liked about this book is that it shows you how to incorporate the "superfoods" into your life in small everyday ways, in addition to complete recipes.  If you're like me, you have lots of cookbooks and health books with recipes that sound good, but you hardly use. I don't want to make a complicated recipe every day.   Pratt and Matthews show you how to introduce the health benefits of these foods into your kitchen and your life seamlessly, including simple food preparation tips and "mini-recipes" as well as more standard recipes.  Things like: mix cinnamon and cocoa and sprinkle on fruit; or mix pomegranate juice with selzer and lemon for a refeshing antioxidant cocktail.  Worth it. 
 Pivot offers a life changing way to alter your attitude.  Dr. Zimmerman gives step-by-step methods to improve your attitude, build up your self esteem, stop being negative and overcome worry.   This book is helping me be more positive, more enthusiastic and more supportive of others.  It can do the same for you, too, if you follow this wise doctor's advice 
 I found the text to be very useful, although it was not the complete and through guide that I was hoping for.  That would probably be in the factory shop manual for the central airconditioner that I am attempting to troubleshoot, and those are hard to come by.  Ron 
 Everyone should have this book 
 Parminder is a remarkable British Punjaban who's more in love with football than the frivolity of her culture!  She's a character that perhaps most desi girls will relate to. Her drive to do her best at what she aspires the most, is what takes a mere sport to turn into her life's biggest opportunity!  Her mom & dad could easily pass off to be mine haa haa...such is the close resemblance of character!  Gurinder's best work to date 
 My mom loves Vince Gill and one year for Christmas I bought her this album. Not only did she fall in love with it but my family did as well. It means so much to us because he wrote a song about his brother and Christmas not being the same with out him, that was the same year we lost my gram. I would tell anyone if your looking for the perfect holiday album this is the one.  My favorite song is "Peace On Earth" the words mean so much and it nice he is singing with his daughter 
 Alice Ramsey of Hackensack, New Jersey was twenty-two years old in June of Nineteen Nine, when she started out on her trip driving trip across America with  her two sisters-in-law and her friend Hermine as passengers. Narrow roads, dirt roads and roads that were barely there at all challenged them, as did mud, rivers and mountains. And when the car broke Alice was the one who had to get it working again. One has to remember that though this trip was a bit less than a century ago, this was an amazing feet. Women didn't have the vote, were considered much to gentle for such a task and many didn't think Alice would come through, but come through she did, making the trip in fifty-nine days.  This is a super book with out of sight illustrations by Mr. Brown. My young son loves the pictures and when he's old enough to really understand the story, he's going to love Alice Ramsey as we read along about her grand adventure. Three thumbs up at my house. One from young Devon, One from Mommy Sara and one from me.  Jack Priest, Dad in Trainin 
 I study time, efficiency and effectiveness so you would think I do not have a problem with procrastination but sometimes I do. So, of course, I bought a book.  The title comes from do the worst thing first thing and the rest of the day is easy.  My modification to this is to creat more than one first thing - eg first thing after lunch.  First thing after dinner etc.  "Eat that Frog - 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less time" by Brian Tracy.   It is a short and easy read. Good book. I did not put off reading it - I read it instead of cleaning up my den. As the title suggests, it has lots of ideas on how to get over procrastination.   Brian Tracy is one of the most prolific self development authors and speakers. His stuff is good, although sometimes too shallow.   One quote from the book:  "There is one quality that one must possess to win and that is a definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants and a burning desire to achieve it"  By Napoleon Hill.  
 I am older than the target audience. But, frankly, I read it because as a young woman raised in the 1970s and 80s, there was no such book for me to read. I still have things to learn about the female anatomy, history of  feminism, and other health and cultural topics that this colorfully written  and instructive book offers. I WISH I HAD THIS 10 YEARS AGO! Today, I just  hope parents, teachers, educators, and other adults in charge of teen girls  will consider buying this book and giving it to a young woman they know. It  will help that girl make informed choices and avoid merely guessing what's  going on with her body or following the latest fad among peers. A must read  for all adults who care about teenage girls and for those girls 
 Game theory has been criticized for being able to explain anything, yet having little predictive capability. Whatever the case, Thomas Schelling's book is a gem. He takes everyday life phenomena and applies some systematic analysis as to why these things happen. It's a quick read and when you are done you too will keep viewing any issues coming your way as if they were seeking an equilibrium. With the varied topics and colorful examples it's the 1970s equivalent of "Freakonomics". 
 Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like.  It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the "Rifle-text", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the "ages" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad & twisted "love story" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah & Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, "...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers & Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful & worthwhile), but here in the most "modern" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints & clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which "voices" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to & for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later.    Next up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt?  From what I understand this will be about the Hopi & Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970's-1980's.  Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip & The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century.  And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians.  Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can't wait - Vollmann's dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various "Ages" of our North American continent.       
 Ross, Weill and Robertson do what no one else has done in the area of Enterprise Architecture (EA).  They have made it understandable and accessible for the executive.  EA is an over abused term, often by IT people to intimidate business users and others.  Ross, Weill and Roberston provide a well researched, clearly written approach for enterprise architecture and how it applied to business and technical strategy.   The subject may sound dry, but think of it this way -- how do you design your company for current success and future flexibility and you have an idea of the power behind the practices in this book.  I say practices rather than ideas because this book is filled with well documented case studies and discussions of what real executives are doing. UPS, CEMEX, Delta Airlines, ING Direct, TD Banknorth are all companies that have realized value.  This makes the book practitioner focused and all the more valuable.  Enterprise Architecture zealots will find this book wanting in terms of detailed diagrams and statement professing the unqualified necessity of EA.  That is a signal to business executives that this is a book for them to understand the business implications of enterprise design and architecture.   This work is the result of careful examination and study of the topic from a business perspective and that care shows.  The book is a balanced and action oriented view on EA, rather than a source of gushing enthusiasm which is something you find in more consulting oriented books.  If you are thinking about how your enterprise can become and sustain its competitive power, change at low risk, and take advantage of new opportunities; then EA may be an answer and this book is the clearest business description of EA, how to implement it and how it works out there.   If you are an IT person, read this book to see how IT concepts like EA are really business initiatives and how to explain them as such to your executives.  If you have unbridled enthusiasm for EA then you may be disappointed in this straightforward, business focused discussion.    The book is organized clearly and presents a well structured argument that can lead executives to better understand the value of an enterprise level design.   Chapter 1: To execute your strategy, first build your foundation.  This chapter discusses the factors that underpin a well designed organization that is agile and efficient.  Chapter 2: Define your operating model. This chapter covers the missing piece for many company strategies and plans -- how are we going to operate.  This section includes an analysis of four major operating model types and what makes them successful.  Chapter 3: Implement the operating model via enterprise architecture.  This chapter is among the most important as it puts EA in its proper place as a tool for strategy realization rather than as an end to itself.   Chapter 4: Navigate the states of Enterprise Architecture Maturity. This is a look at the benefits executives should expect as they invest in and realize results from EA  Chapter 5: Cash In on Learning. This chapter discusses the use of management practices and the ability to improve the enterprise because it has an explicit detailed design in the EA.  Chapter 6: Build the foundation one project at a time.  With the rational and value of EA understood the book now turns to how you establish an EA and realize its value.   Chapter 7: Use Enterprise Architecture to guide outsourcing.  Outsourcing is a big issue that will not go away and one that is subject to abuse, unless it is part of an enterprise design and therefore part of the EA.  Chapter 8 Now- exploit your foundation for profitable growth.  This chapter should be read early by executives to understand what is possible for the business, top and bottom line growth.   Chapter 9 Take Charge! The Leadership Agenda discusses the actions and principles needed to make the enterprise successful through EA.   This chapter is pretty standard, but it does a great job of showing how EA fits with what executives already know about leadership and growth. 
 I will go out on a limb here and declare this movie the most heartbreakingly beautiful film I ever saw. I went to see it when it came out, and it continued to haunt me until I obtained my first VCR, whereupon it was one of the first movies I purchased. The story is told pretty much visually, and it is such an old story that the viewer doesn't need any more dialog than there is. One reviewer addressed the issue of Linda Manz's New York accent when the trio of protagonists is supposed to be from Chicago; but after multiple viewings, it became clear to me that these guys have been nomads since day one, so it's quite plausible to me that they, in fact, did come from New York originally (Richard Gere also has a decided Noo Yawk sound) and in the way of migrant workers, had only recently called Chicago home. The opening of the movie - old turn-of-the-century stills - is rife with the melting-pot faces that, mostly, started out in New York and went where the work was.  When I need an example of absolute perfection - my opinion - in cinematography, this is the film I would always choose. So many isolated shots come to mind - a wine glass sitting on a riverbed underwater with a fish swimming by; five guys, conversing quietly in another language as they walk, bundled against winter; the panic of animals in a brushfire, a burning tractor coming out of a fire at night like a machine from hell - as well as spooky, ghostly sights of people around a campfire at night on a rivershore; faces that you would not normally consider beautiful taking on a luminous quality because of the talent of the filming. The story almost takes a back seat to the filmwork, although it is nearly a Greek tragedy; Bill, Linda, and Abby, migrant workers scraping to survive and stay together (Bill and Linda are sister and brother; Abby is Bill's lover) escape a situation in Chicago (Bill has inadvertently killed a bullheaded boss) by jumping a train loaded down with immigrants and ride to the wheatfields of the Texas Panhandle, where they become just three more harvesters until the owner, played with a sweet vulnerability by Sam Shepard, catches sight of Abby in the field and falls in love with her. Bill sees this in his unfocused mind as a way for his little group to advance, after he overhears a conversation between Shepard and a doctor which suggests that the young landowner is dying. Bill persuades Abby to accept the owner's offer of marriage - which, to her credit, she seems initially reluctant to do - reasoning that she can make the guy happy for the little time he has left and then the fortune he has will be all theirs. His plan hits a snag over three things; a suspicious foreman, who loves the landowner like a son and distrusts the trio of migrants right now; the landowner seems to hit his second wind after marrying Abby; and, the biggest bad thing, Abby falls in love with her new husband. Left out frustrated in the cold, suffering unending animosity from the foreman, Bill does the only intelligent thing he can think of and leaves, only to return some time later. From there things go very badly.  This movie gives a real flavour of what the early 1900s must have been like - the serendipity of a travelling circus, apparently out of gas, who land on the owner's property and give performances in exchange for room and board (and probably gas)- these things happened then, impromptu little entertainments that seemed to have little relevance to the surroundings but which were eagerly looked for - diversions were few and far between, folks - and at one point, the newformed family group runs to meet and wave at Woodrow Wilson's passing train. The ordinary people doing the harvesting, though only touched on, are clear and real; you've seen these people in town, working, playing, fighting. And the pathos of the underclass comes out in something Linda Manz's character says halfway through in a voiceover: "You're only here once, and you should have it nice."  This movie is tragic and beautiful, with good performances, especially from Linda Manz as the hapless younger sister who is at the mercy of circumstances she is powerless to control, and who learns the cruel lesson so many like her had to learn in those days; how to survive on your own. Ms. Manz pretty much disappeared from film after that and returned to private life. Too bad - she was a breath of fresh air in a lot of ways. In fact, the only people who really advanced filmwise after this were Richard Gere and Sam Shepard - although Gere isn't as good yet as he could be (again, my opinion) and Sam Shepard is underused or too preoccupied with his writing. I highly recommend this movie to cinematography aficianados and to anyone who likes a good period piece told with great sensitivity and minimal dialog.   
 This Viking saga probably has more roots in so called "myth" than any others I have read and its one of the most entertaining ones also. Includes appearances by Odin, Valkyries and a dragon along with all the usual inter tribal "politics" of heads getting cracked by swords and axes 
 About five years ago, a friend of mine had two copies of this CD and gave one to me.  I knew nothing of Arvo Part, but am a big fan of both choral music and modern composition.  The Te Deum instantly became one of my favorite all time compositions.  Perfection.  It's a brilliant realization of what church music should be in modern terms.  I hear a lot of great modern "sacred" compositions, but there are few I find that evoke emotion while still maintaining reverence.  Most are either rehashes of the familiar or composers who branch out to write a choral piece with little understanding of vocal music or care of if the piece is actually church worthy.    Part's Te Deum is chant meets minimalism (though he doesn't like the label) and is avant garde but still accessible to a wide variety of tastes.  As an added bonus, it is performed by an amazingly capable choir in an aurally gorgeous space.  Do yourself a favor and set aside some time where you're not doing anything else for your first listen 
 Ronny Yu chose the perfect characters to play the lovers! Brigitte Lin looks absolutely beautiful in every angle in every scene. This movie will not be good for those who are expecting to see a great deal of martial arts. From the moment Leslie see's Brigette Lin, the story continues to concentrate how the two interact with each other. The love scene is breathtaking with the falling cascades of water around the couple. I have to say I did not expect to see such moves that Leslie made while filming the love scene with Brigette. For those who loves listening to Leslie, the theme song is a must buy! 
 The entire ultra-lounge series is excellent.  However, all of the CD's in this collection only add up to a small tantilizing taste of the huge back catalog of vintage easy listening albums from the 50's & 60's - not to mention the Hawaiian LP's which are surpisingly underrepresented on the Tiki Sample and in the Ultra-Lounge series as a whole.  Common Captiol/EMI, start releasing some of these vintage albums in their complete form!!!!!!!!! 
 I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases 
 Here's some thoughts that I have regarding Ray Davies' Thanksgiving Day EP:  1. The title track reminds me a lot of Otis Redding. I can imagine him covering it. I especially enjoyed the horns. I had to look at the muscian credits to see if they were the Memphis Horns (& was surprised to see that they weren't).  2. I also enjoyed the other three tracks, although I preferred the original version of London Song, since I felt that, in the words of the reviewer from the Bluegrass State, it "ROCKED" more.  3. Not that it has anything to do with the EP, but I think that it's interesting when Ray started out in this country, his labelmates included Dean Martin & Trini Lopez & now they include the White Stripes.  4. Speaking of the reviewer from the Bluegrass State, my feeling is that Ray, as well as any member of any group, has every right to perform & release as a solo, especially since Dave has released solo projects in the past. I'm looking forward to Ray's album next February, which this EP is a good taster.  (Note: the mention of the reviewer from the Bluegrass State referred to a negative review that has been deleted who bascially said that Ray was selfish in pursuing a solo career instead of getting the Kinks back together & that brother Dave "ROCKED" 
 One of the best, and incredibly influential.  What we know today about Kennedy was not probably available to White, and nobody would have dared to put it in print at the time anyway.  White's books on the '64, '68, and '72 campaigns are just as good, and though long out of print are readily available and cheap at any used book store.  Classic stuff 
 I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12, and she has had a ball playing it. Though there are English subtitles because it is spoken in very fast Japanese, that doesn't take away from the game's adventures. The instructions given are very clear, and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks,  it really is quite enjoyabl 
 I wasn't looking for a writing how-to, but I'd read Roorbach's previous book, "Summers With Juliet," so I decided to try this one. Even if you never plan on writing anything in your life, or if you've already  written 10 books, Roorbach's book is a treasure -- funny and smart and  inspiring in all kinds of ways 
 'The Presocratic Philosophers' edited by G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven is, on a personal level, dear to me as it is the very first book I bought when I began studying philosophy as my major in college. This trade paperback cost but $3.95. For the philosophical amateurs who may have stumbled over this review while plowing through my cookbook reviews, the most dramatic aspect of this book is how little we actually have of what these great men who invented philosophy actually wrote. For the very first figure, Thales of Melitis (a town on the Asia Minor coast), we have practically nothing except second hand reports from Diogenes Laertius, Herodotus, Plutarch, and others. Also for amateurs is the great introductory essay on the difference between mythical cosmology and the beginnings of philosophy.  If you happen to have a strong amateur interest in the history of ideas and can pick up an inexpensive early edition (I have one from 1962), I recommend you give this a look.  For serious professionals, the most important aspect of this original text is the very scholarly presentation of the fragments in the original Greek with excellent translations and commentary on the sources 
 I own this book and it is one of the greatest pieces of literature that I have read. Ivan van Sertima tells it like it is. The Moors were African people who hailed from the northwestern part of Africa. No other people would come out of that continent but BLACK people. They were many, many years ahead of their time and everybody else's time, too. An advanced, superior civilization of Africans that was the center of culture, education, and arts/crafts to the entire world made their presence felt. And when it came to war with France and England, even the greatest of warriors from those places couldn't stand up to the powerful onslaught of these people. Many intelligent African/Arabic/Ethiopic men were a huge part of this era (i.e. Abd-er-Rahman II-III, Ibn-Aby-Amir). These rulers were very powerful and not even the biggest of Christian rebellions led by extreme, hypocritical bigots could put a dent in Morrocan rule. From the Abbisade to the Ummeyyad, Almoravide, and Almohade dynasties everything is covered from the Moors superior knowledge of irrigation and astrology to their lavish lifestyles. The Europeans sat at the feet of African Moorish scientists and teachers (both men and women) and learned everything there was to learn. That's why I look at the Renaissance Period as a time frame when Europeans finally learned to think and do for themselves. Something that African-Morrocan descendents like myself have been doing for eons. This information is the last thing America wants its black citizens to know about as a whole. It's the reason why big, strong, and intelligent black men like me are easily intimidating to whites. This book is a must for all African-Americans nationwide. Pick up this book and KNOW THYSELF. Peace 
 The second edition of Linda N. Edelstein, Ph.D.'s WRITER'S GUIDE TO CHARACTER TRAITS provides over 400 reference lists of character traits from a range of behaviors, paired with tips on how to incorporate these traits into a plot and build upon it. This is a psychology primer paired with a writer's guide: a unique approach which takes common psychology, explains it for a lay writer's community, then melds it into plot development basics 
 If I had only $50 in my movie book budget, I would buy TWO of Jim Parish's latest. I woudl give the second copy to any decision-maker in the industry. At first it seems that in this book there are only 14 "iconic flops" discussed. But in fact there are hundreds of films discussed and a mind-blowing list of financial failures appended and sorted chronologically. The cast list, for which Parish is famous (and copied), are worth the price of the book. How else would we know who played Charlie Chaplin in "The Cotton Club"? Let's hope the industry can learn from past mistakes dn Parish's  analysis. He knows the industry, the people, the history, the priorities. If the industry doesn't learn, it won't be the fault of Parish. This is a must read for anyone who wants movies to be worth our time and attention...although it is often fun also to see the flops, especially if we weren't investors in the stupid thing. Meanwhile, this book is definately a good investment. 
 Boys who are 10 to 15 years old can use this book as a guide for how to grow into being an outdoorsman. Its 19 chapters cover the requirements to obtain the various Scout ranks and honors, as well as an outline of outdoor  skills and personal development. It is well written and well illustrated.  Its major flaw is that it is not integrated with the Girl Scouts - it is  strictly a book for boys, and as such it is too limited. For a book that  tries to integrate healthy activities, it fails by not communicating the  appropriate example, tone, and respect for male/female differences and  similarities. Hopefully in the next edition a section will be added  integrating all Scouts. That would make this a truly outstanding book 
 I am an attorney (shyreslaw.com) and I highly recommend this book for those who could use a simple trust and want to avoid probate.  Even if you decide to hire an attorney, this book is invaluable because it offers great insight into trusts and avoiding the probate system.  Attorney Denis Clifford wrote this great do-it-yourself book which provides everyone a way to create their own simple living trust.  A CD-ROM is also provided so you can easily input your information and print it out.    For a more complete estate plan, the book introduces the importance of pourover wills in case the trust fails to encompass all the property.  You may want to peruse Mr. Clifford's Simple Will Book as well (another recommended buy).   
 Television is an oddity - associated with punk even though they have more in common with Ayler than The Clash, it's a band that was nevertheless associated with the burgeoning NY punk scene.  That scene, having been forced to find new places to play after Mercer came tumbling down, found three new digs to occupy - CBGB's, Max's Kansas City and 82 Club.  Television, in spite of having played a long engagement at CGBGB's, were mostly looked upon as a Max's band, much like Patti Smith was.  GBGB's is now known as the house The Ramones built but Blondie and The Talking Heads played there often enough to call it their backyard.    The point of all this is that riding the Patti Smith wave, record execs were looking to catch some big fish playing in the NY pond, and some of these fish were Television (around 1974 they were probably looked upon as most likely to succeed), The Ramones, Talking Heads, Richard Hell, Suicide, Johnny Thunder and The Heartbreakers and Blondie.  As a result, these bands get lumped together even though Television has more in common stylistically with The Albert Ayler Trio than they do with The Ramones.  That Verlaine held the Ramones beneath contempt should tell you all you need to know about what he thought of having Television lumped in with that crowd.  Television is not three chord rock.  It's not angry in the way The Sex Pistols were angry (actually most American punk isn't angry the way Brit punk was).  What Television Is, it's a combination of kids tired of the same old crap.  It's a handful of guys who liked VU and Albert Ayler and old black blues men and Captain Beefheart.  If you wanna call it punk, you should really call it art-punk.  That's especially appropriate since Verlaine took his moniker from a French poet.  The problem is that when people first get introduced to Television as a punk band they don't get it.  They expect three chords played fast and angry and the expectations are met with arpeggios and harmonics and astonishingly artful drumming.  In other words, the expectations are NOT met.  But if you don't like something, it doesn't necessarily mean it sucks.  Hardcore punkers will most likely be disappointed with Marquee Moon's lack of anger.  Jazz heads will be disappointed with Marquee Moon's structure.  Deadheads will be disappointed with Marquee Moon's lack of relaxed atmosphere and Verlaine's screeching voice.  The only ones not disappointed will be those that are open to hearing something new.  "Venus", "Prove It" and "Torn Curtain" don't feature chug-a-lug, downstream picking.  They feature shimmering guitars interplaying with complex chords and delicate drumming, walking bass lines and counterpoint - not typical punk staples. Heck, "Guiding Light" even feature (gasp!) piano.  The new and re-mastered edition features Patti Smith pal R. Mapplethorpe's original shot of the undernourished band and Mr. Ficca's giant afro) as well as a handful of alternate takes, a 7 minute "Little Johnny Jewel" and an unreleased cut.  To my ears, Television belongs right in between The Velvet Underground and Big Star, having carved itself into a niche that no one is entirely sure how to categorize (I only care enough to do so because their own confused status seems to demand a clarification so perhaps art rock or smart rock will do the trick) 
 This was a very touching and sweet story. It is amazing that someone would be that mean to take thousands of lives and destroy them. It is also amazing that [Hitler] would force kids to join the army. I would hate to serve him 
 It seems like a gimmick but they really work. I was using the little jazz IIIs but couldn't strum with them - these work as a mix of a soft strumming pick and a precise hard lead pick 
 This book has all different ways to use pockets as a teaching tool, but I like the extra suggestions and so-called extended activities, too. There are ways to pull out the book to use with math and language lessons, not just when I'm doing my special pocket unit, which is one of the most popular for my 4 and 5 year olds. This author has excellent ideas for language development, especially in helping kids to speak in sentences instead of just phrases. It's a bargain at any price 
 I came to Krishnamurti through studying Joseph Campbell. The ideas presented in this book literally shake the foundations of society and force the individual into an internal dialogue about the nature of time, thought, self, and one's place in society. The end result of Krishnaji's teachings is always silence--vast, and energy filled creativity. This one is a must read 
 This chick can really sing. Many of the songs have a pop tinge to them, but it's definitely worth giving her a listen 
 This book is a good collection of short stories for the aspiring SF reader. However, for the more serious that read such books as the Foundation series or Dune, it is in all respects, a book that grasped me  for a select few stories 
 A previous reviewer called this film unnerving.  Being a university professor, I can certainly attest that it touched a nerve.  Oleanna is a fascinating character study that will almost certainly evoke powerful feelings in whoever watches it.  After seeing it, I felt a lingering sense of unease that I couldn't quite explain.  I thought about the film a long time before the reason dawned on me.  Oleanna is a story about a power play between two relatively unsympathetic characters:  a pompous, complacent Professor and a dedicated, but dense, Student.  At the start, the failing Student is seeking help from the seemingly indifferent Professor.  As the plot slowly unfolds, we see that the Professor is not as uncaring as he  initially appears.  In fact, he delays a critical real estate deal to stay and counsel the student.  Ironically, because of his compassion toward her, the advantage gradually shifts from the Professor to the Student.  By the end of the story, it's shockingly clear how high the stakes really were--the power play has morphed into a death match.    Some reviewers have argued that each character's point of view has merit.  For example, the Student has sacrificed & struggled to get to college, and is (rightly) angry that she if failing a course by a the Professor who holds higher education in utter contempt.  That being said, the Student is clearly unable to grasp anything beyond a literal interpretation of what she reads, hears, or experiences.  Because of this, it's painfully obvious that she doesn't belong in college.  However, rather than hold her to a clear intellectual standard, the Professor tries to coddle and accomodate her.  It is this misguided deed, combined with her literal & paranoid interpretation of his actions, that leads to the Professor's undoing.    In the aftermath of their initial meeting, the Student charges the Professor with sexual harrassment and abuse of power.  In subsequent acts, the Professor tries to reason with her, which only makes matters worse.  Ultimately, she convinces the all-powerful Tenure committee to embrace her version of the truth.  Only in the final act is it revealed she may have been out to destroy the Professor from the start.  In fact, there's a not so subtle hint that she thinks she's God.  And why shouldn't she?  By the end of the story she has managed to change the destiny of both the Professor and herself.  So what is the moral of this story?  It is, simply, that the educated will let the stupid inherit the Earth.  What makes Oleanna  particulary frightening is that this can, and does, happen every day 
 Have you EVER felt as tho you were being hypnotized by television, radio and the newspaper?  Or do you ever feel as tho you are watching the same thing on tv NO MATTER WHAT CHANNEL YOU TURN TO FOR THE NEWS? This book by Norm Chomsky gives powerful information to help you understand why you may feel the way you do.  It is not your fault and you are not alone. The question is, What will you do now that you know?  Read this book to open not only your eyes but also your mind to a whole different view of mass media and its intentions for the public. 
 I love this Book its true classic King. For me it was a quick read and I loved every minute of it. Malkes me wonder why he changed what made his books so great. I just am glad he is finaly back in form. (or atleast close 
 This is a great book which I read when I was 10 years old, and I never forgot it.  I'm nearly 60 now, and I wanted to find the book and relive the adventure.  And so I did, and I loved the story now as much as I did almost 50 years ago.  The storyline is ageless, a frolic which is still enjoyable 
 The product was as advertized and was receaved faster than anticipate 
 As the title suggests, the film was produced in 2004 and so it includes some recent performances with some other artists. What came as a big surprise to me was seeing some members of the Weavers, some sang with them, and Pete Seeger who spoke and evaluated them so fairly.   If you haven't heard much of Peter, Paul and Mary, this DVD will give you almost a full taste of each of them, as each sings a number of solo songs by their own other than group singing. Here you will discover that not only are Peter and Mary magnetic and charming, Paul's singing is poetic too... I find this DVD rewarding enough. 
 If you liked any of Patricia MacLachlan's books, this one will satisfy you! It's about Emma, who is eight years old, whose father is an "Eyeball Doctor" and has to go to an "Eyeball Meeting" with Emma's mother, which means Emma and her teenage brother Zach's uncle and aunt have to come baby-sit them for a week. This week teaches Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Elliot about being parents, from divided grapefruits to "night rumbles", and it teaches Emma and Zach about "different spokes for different folks". I read this book when I was 11, but my sisters, ages 7 and 6, listened to it as a read aloud, so I really can recomend it to anyone!! Great book indeed 
 We got this for our son's first Christmas when he was 10 months old. At first he just like the shapes when they were out of the table... they rattle. It wasn't until about 14 months old that he started to understand the concept of hitting them through the table with the hammer. Now at 17 months old it is one of his favorites. The string on the hammer could be just a little longer... it has to be lined up just perfect in order to have enough room to hit the shapes. Also the sides could be a little taller so that the shape actually fell through the other side when it is sitting on the floor. Normally my son wants me to hold it while he hits so he can push the shapes all the way through. Overall we really like this toy and I'm always excited to find a basic non-battery skill teaching toy. We recite the colors while playing with this and some of the shapes... although some are hard to really name. Oh and my son thinks any toy you can hit is great... definate bonus. 
 Jill Malter gives a terrible review to any book that dares to say, even in the most timid way, that the Palestinians might have the teeniest bit of a point.  The pattern suggests that this is her automatic reaction to any book that does not agree with her prejudices.  So please disregard her reviews; they are biased in the extreme.  
 i had actually lost this album and bought it again! its so jazzy and cool to listen to these tunes. Not to mention the calling of all "inner tonny soprano's" inside all of us becomes live with this classic album 
 The Student Larousse Dictionary is an excellent resource and a very convenient size.  Am trying to relearn French after many years and need all the help I can get.  
 This is one of the most pivotal books in my mid-life transition during the early 90's. I was then a corporate rat. I was working in quiet desperation.  I also knew that I would still continue as a rat even if I have succeeded in the corporate world. I was 43 years old then...looking damned good but actually going nowhere!  Together with the Richard Leider's other books (as well as Frederic Hudson's, plus Richard Bolles' books), it dramatically  changed my life for better as I am now doing what I love & loving what I do.  This book introduced me to the authors' Inventurer process model - an excursion into self discovery, during which it helped me to clarify my inner values, through a series of structured exercises, checklists & reflective questions. Many of the questions were soul searching for me.  Trained as a mechanical engineer, I naturally found some minor parts of the book somewhat esoteric, but on hindsight  I think they are relevant if one is seeking deeper understanding of oneself.  Here are the relevant chapters of the book:  Section 1: The Life Inventure 1 The Inventurers 2 The Postponed Life 3 The Inventurous Life  Section 2: Life Extensions 4 Adult Life Stages 5 Life Cycle Review 6 Alone Toegther  Section 3: ifestyles 7 The Balancing Act 8 Body 9 Mind 10 Spirit 11 Dreams & Goals  Section 4 Work Styles 12 Making a Living Work 13 The Scorecard 14 Skills, the Root of All 15 Survival Skills 16 What Species...? 17 You only Go Round Once 18 Step 1 Your Excursion Map 19 Step 2 Conclusions 20 Step 3 Getting Feedback & Ideas 21 Step 4 Reality Testing  For the uninitiated, an inventurer is just one who is willing to take a fresh, hard look at oneself & consider new options,  venture inward & explore. An inventurer sees life as a series of changes, changes as growth experiences, & growth as positive.  At the onset, what struck me most about this book are the important assumptions which the book is based upon  & the Inventurer process reflects these assumptions. Let me share them with readers as follows by paraphasing the authors:  1 Coping with change: We all have different styles of coping...you need to learn what your style is & how to use it effectively; 2 Untapped abilities: ...you possess much untapped potential that could change your life considerably; 3 Self-direction: The basic ingredient in life & career renewal is choice - the choice of taking responsibility for yourself.  In any  situation, you have basically two options: change the situation or change the mindset that is perceiving the situation. The choice is yours alone... 4 Organised planning: Effectively assessing life & career renewal options requires more than new insights...Your reflections must be organised & focused into an action plan...& self discipline is a virtue... 5 Risk taking: Choices involve risks. Risk is the element in career or life...  This is one particular book you have to read it carefully & work with it systematically if you really want to evaluate your life & make it better.  To conclude my review, I strongly recommend this wonderful book to anyone who is thinking about making a major career or life change or anyone seeking just to understand themselves better! 
 This soundtrack is great! The music or Star Wars has always enchanted me. I am so glad it came out on CD! The best track on it by far however is "Cantina Band" which is the music played in the Mos Eisleys Bar, in which Luke meets Han Solo! A great buy worth every cent 
 We bought this playhouse for our daughter's 2nd B-day. First of all, let me say it is a beautiful playhouse! The door-bell doesn't ring loudly and the play phone rings the same way. It was very easy to build, but it took two people, for holding purposes. The front porch is very roomy but as you enter into the house it's VERY SMALL inside, 30 1/2 wide by 41 1/2 long!!! Overall, the house is quite large appearing as you view from the outside. The inside is LITTLE. I really can't see two children being able to play in the house part without knocking into each other. I really liked the porch idea but i just didn't realize that it took away sooo much inside the house section. I really like Step2 and we have several of their products but this one will have to go back. Sorry Step2! 
 I bought this book two weeks ago and haven't stopped using it yet!  Unlike previous reviews, I find that the ingredients are easy to find, especially if you have a local farmer's market to hand which can make fruit shopping quite inexpensive.  Also, take the advice of the authors and freeze the fruit as it is in the height of season.  That way, you save on expense and can enjoy the flavorful tastes of summer any time you want!  My favorite recipes from the book are the Nectarine Nelly (orange juice, nectarines and mango) and the Cherry Pop (soda, cherries and ice cream, etc.).  In addition, many of these recipes can be adapted to your own tastes and the book includes many options--even for those who prefer soy products over milk products.  All in all, there's something for everyone here 
 Perhaps the most underrated Dylan album in his catalogue. It's a shame Bob didn't use the piano as his prominent instrument more often. The songs are wonderfully introspective with a blues and traditional southern gospel flair.   "If Not For You" is an excellent love song that is very laid back and welcoming. It should've been a big pop hit. Songs like "Day Of The Locusts", "Time Passes Slowly", and the title track keep up that laid back, southern porch song type of feel with a stripped down rootsy production. "Winterlude", "Sign On The Window", and "The Man In Me" are just downright beautiful songs, showing an unprecedented vulnerablity that predates Blood On The Tracks.  Overall, I think this is an excellent album and one of the best Bob Dylan albums in my mind. It is a unique, soulful Dylan album. Even better than Blood On The Tracks if you ask me 
 If you like funky instrumentals then these German funkmeisters will make your night. At times sounding like long lost instrumentals from some old 70's action films and spaced out James Brown's "stuck-in-the-groove" backing band. Even after repeat listens , the album just gets better! Great backing music for a party , strolling through the town with your headphones on , or on a roadtrip on the fly. The Poets Of Rhythm will put a wide smile on your face and your day 
 I have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck, that Dream Cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks. I've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after I get out of the shower on my legs. It has completely gotten rid of the red, bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter. I've tried dozens of body lotions/creams and this is my absolute favorite 
 Some of John Lee Hooker's best known songs are compiled from his many years and albums onto this budget CD, with not one being one you will skip over.  From "Boogie Chillen'" to "Boom, Boom,"  they are all here.  Even the songs which made others famous, such as "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer."    "I'm Bad Like Jesse James" is a favorite of mine, with this particular song showing his inimitable rambling style so strikingly, a style which over the years can be found less and less.   It should be noted that the version of "I'm in the mood" on this album is different than the Chess side he recorded with the Chess brothers (I actually prefer the more polished Chess side).  But regardless, each song is representative of a different time in his life, as this legendary bluesman recorded over 100 albums during his lifetime, one of the most prolific bluesmen in history.  A must own for any lover of the blues. 
 Most of the short stories were quite good and left me wanting to delve into the characters more; others not so much.  Overall a good, light read 
 Conservative commentator Barbara Olson, who perished when the hijacked Flight 77 dove into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, reminds us with "The Final Days" precisely what sort of leeching parasites politicians can be. This is not a strict "Republican" or "Democrat" kind of thing, nor is it an issue pertaining to just "conservatives" or just "liberals." The book is not biased just because it reports only the Clinton wrongdoings, even though the author is a self-proclaimed conservative. In fact, the flip side to Olson's coin is the recently released "State of Denial" by Bob Woodward, who similarly documents the slime coursing through the current Bush administration and the ongoing war in Iraq. No, "The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House" merely reiterates a well-worn fact of life dominant in today's world: Power corrupts.   Olson's final account about the closing of doors in the Clinton administration should send alarm bells screeching through the minds of the American electorate, especially in a time where a Hillary Clinton run for the presidency seems almost inevitable. Olson reveals with painstaking accuracy the core tenets of Clintonism: Deny the accusations, play the helpless victim, and attack the enemy with relentless savagery. And, of course, it is permissible to lie whenever the chance arrives. When many liberal Democrats pressured him truthfully to explain everything behind the pardon of Marc Rich and his associates, President Clinton acknowledged that those he pardoned, who evaded millions in taxes and maintained connections with the Castro and Gaddafi regimes, simply had been wrongfully persecuted by the Justice Department. It is a classic example of the `victim hood' phenomenon so popularly paraded by the Clintons. Everyone seems to be a poor, pitiable victim, especially if their names end with "Clinton" and the persecutor is that dang "right-wing conspiracy." I'm afraid the term you're looking for, Mr. and Mrs. President, is "vast critical-thinking conspiracy." Or perhaps the "concerned American citizen conspiracy."  Like "State of Denial," "The Final Days" wields sharp facts to counter the myths surrounding popular politicians. Clinton may have presided over the largest economic expansion in U.S. history, but the shameless "For Sale" sign dangling around his neck during the closing days of his administration calls into question his serious character and moral flaws. Similarly, Bush may have stated "Mission Accomplished" in Iraq, but the fact that we are still there waging a failing campaign at the expense of American and Iraqi blood does not make his acts justifiable. I highly recommend both books to spark in your head the idea that maybe we need to rethink seriously the decision of putting these kinds of people in power. 
 As a practicing physical chemist for almost 50 years I just could not ignore the volatility/diffusion discussion on page 194.  Ethylene has a slightly higher molecular weight than does nitrogen and slightly lower than does oxygen.  Clearly diffusion cannot explain the absence of ethylene.    Almost certainly reactivity can explain the absence of ethylene, but I am not an organic chemist.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Oracle.  I dug out Betrayers and enjoyed re-reading it 
 "Love in the Time of Cholera", an arresting tale of unrequited love, dramatically chronicles a 50-year love triangle set in Columbia, spanning from roughly 1880 to 1930. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, with an intensity that rivals the classics, explores the concept that suffering for love is akin to a genre of nobility. Based on the perception that love-sickness is a literal infirmity, the author effectively uses cholera throughout the novel as a metaphor for love - love as a malady comparable to a devastating ailment.  The condemned vertices of the love triangle include the obsessive lyricist, Florentino Ariza, who falls desperately and dangerously in love with the beautiful headstrong Fermina Daza. After meeting only briefly, the two commence an intense 3-year romance-by-letter. As years pass and Daza matures, she ultimately casts off any feelings towards the romantically love-sick Ariza, and instead, offers her hand in matrimony to the practical and respectable Doctor Juvenal Urbino - a specialist in overcoming the wide sweep of choleraic outbreaks.  Heartbroken and rejected by the only woman he will ever truly love, Florentino Ariza does everything in his power to try to forget Daza, to no avail. And so, for over 50 years, he is left to be tormented by his passion for the woman he cannot forget, attempting to move on and yet hoping all the while she will return to him, even in the winter years of his life.  The touching bitter-sweet conclusion to the severity of "Love in the Time of Cholera" will be sure to satisfy. 
 When you read the very beginning of the book, before the first tale, you get the notion that dogs can talk and that they live amongst robots.  The immediate impression is that this could be the silliest science fiction ever concocted, but as you progress through the tales, you realize that this book is science fiction at its best.  Overall, a well-conceived and executed work with a sad message about humanity.  Skip all the Kim Stanley Robinson books and read this (or Hyperion) 
 As a professional I found this book to offer a lot of basic information that a family could understand about down syndrome.  All the children I work with with Down Syndrome, their families have this book and said it helped them so much 
 beautiful songs. beautiful voice. i love it. and thanks to amazon for replacement cd's that i orde 
 The Defense in any mystery is what comes out from the author's imagination.  No wonder wehy these sisters arte so compelling when it comes to great mysteries. A truely great read from start to finish. Grisham has his rivals from this author. A great mystery and it will not be their last either I hope 
 Mr. Tidwell, whic being a travel writer, has done Louisiana, and all who love Louisiana a great service.  He has put into words something that many of us who live or lived in Louisiana did not know, and if we did know, did not know what to do about it. Everyone whether they live in Louisiana or in the United States should take a little bit of time and contact their representatives in congress or Baton Rouge and let them know that loosing out state is not acceptable--whatever the cost.    Thank you Mr. Tidwell. 
 I've read a few reviews with complaints about popcorn going everywhere & here's what I've found 1) use a big bowl, I use a mixing bowl because it has high sides & the popped corn can't bounce out, 2) unplug it when there are still a few kernels left & it's really not an issue - things start flying when the weight of the popcorn is so little that the fan pushes it around. Overall I like it a lot, it's a good product! 
 This is my favorite bread book bar none. However, it's for the serious baker. The recipes are industrial, so you need to break out a calculator and have a scale to measure ingredients. You also need a serious mixer that can simulate an industrial mixer. Kitchen Aid would work, but I use a Bosch.  By using this book, the quality of my bread dramatically improved due primarily to (1) his mixing techniques, and (2) his autolyse (rest period) for whole wheat breads.  Any other bread book that's worth anything references this one. I think the other bread books probably sell more because they are more user friendly. But this is the foundation upon which all others seem to build.  If you're way serious about bread baking, this is the book for you 
 These were attractive people on the street, not professional models (except one but it was just happenstance!) and the clothes they chose to wear that day.  I like street fashion more than runway fashion. My only negative thought was that, while stylish, the outfits were very middle of the road. There were very few examples of anything remotely extreme like in Fruits.  I would like to see more outrageous fashion, people whith character who are interesting regardless of age or size. I did really like this book and I see something new everytime I look through it 
 Much better than I expected.  The music is great.  The dancing is great.  The humor is rapid-fire, but it goes over the head at times.  Desi Arnaz looks so incredibly young, you'd think he was still in high school.  His Conga scene is simply one of the best musical numbers ever put on film.  Drawbacks:  Lucille Ball seems miscast, and it's obvious someone has dubbed her singing.  Also, the whole thing should've been filmed in color.  However, I highly recommend "Too Many Girls."  Somebody PLEASE colorize it!! 
 This book was not your usual biography, where it lulls at certain points, the entire book was an enjoyable read.  It covers his life from beginning to end and focuses on his character.  
 Intrigued, I wondered how Capote could manage to write a book about a crime that, while gruesome, at first glance doesn't appear to be the sort to sustain a book. Upon starting it I was hooked, he not only found the story but manages to tell it from many different perspectives while keeping the raw emotion intact, putting you right there throughout. At the same time he comes across as unbiased in his telling. Not only does he create a genre with this book, he defines what it is at it's best. As an aside, to watch the movie Capote after reading this book makes clear the methods he used, unprecedented access to the criminals, etc. in order to create this masterpeice. 
 This is one of the finast works I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.It covers a almost forgotten period of our nation's history when young men were actually inspired to fight for the honor of a nation and it's culture. The primacy of male emotions,another much ignored literary topic,is on view in every chapter. There is action,chvalry,war ,peace,love and revenge. This is one that is better than the movie and almost impossible to put down 
 I LOVE THIS DVD!!! Commissioned is easily my favorite Christian band of all time. I never get tired of hearing their awesome harmonies, and spiritual lyrics, so when I heard that this DVD was out, I bought it just like that. I can't get enough of watching this DVD. Like others, I only wish there were special features, interviews, etc.  The band setup was absolutely amazing - how can such high quality harmony and sound come from so many talented musicians and singers without sounding too "loud?" Fred Hammond is a genius. It all comes out so clean and smooth, just like Commissioned has always been. These guys set the standard for soulful R&B harmonies, even amongst the secular realm of music.  I hope Commissioned does another reunion and they come to the SF Bay Area 
 ...and.....  The piano has been drinking My necktie's asleep The combo went back to New York, and left me all alone The jukebox has to take a leak Have you noticed that the carpet needs a haircut? And the spotlight looks just like a prison break And the telephone's out of cigarettes As usual the balcony's on the make And the piano has been drinking, heavily The piano has been drinking And he's on the hard stuff tonight  The piano has been drinking And you can't find your waitress Even with the Geiger counter And I guarantee you that she will hate you From the bottom of her glass And all of your friends remind you That you just can't get served without her The piano has been drinking  The piano has been drinking And the lightman's blind in one eye And he can't see out of the other And the piano-tuner's got a hearing aid And he showed up with his mother And the piano has been drinking Without fear of contradiction I say The piano has been drinking  Our Father who art in ? Hallowed by thy glass Thy kindom come, thy will be done On Earth as it is in the lounges Give us this day our daily splash Forgive us our hangovers As we forgive all those who continue to hangover against us And lead us not into temptation But deliver from evil and someone you must all ride home  Because the piano has been drinking And he's your friend not mine Because the piano has been drinking And he's not my responsibility  The bouncer is this Sumo wrestler Kinda cream puff casper milk toast And the owner is just a mental midget With the I.Q. of a fencepost I'm going down, hang onto me, I'm going down Watch me skate across an acre of linoleum I know I can do it, I'm in total control And the piano has been drinking And he's embarassing me The piano has been drinking, he raided his mini bar  The piano has been drinking And the bar stools are all on fire And all the newspapers were just fooling And the ash-trays have retired And I've got a feeling that the piano has been drinking It's just a hunch The piano has been drinking and he's going to lose his lunch And the piano has been drinking Not me, not me, The piano has been drinking not me   Enjoy this book kiddies.  Buk can do no wrong, he never did.  Turn on only one lamp, with no shade (as if there ever was one), open up a bottle of Ol' Red Eye, throw the cap away, put on some T.Waits, and cherish the fact that you and your misery are not as alone as you thought 
 It was always clear from his background vocals and scats that jazz guitarist Norman Brown could sing.  And on West Coast Coolin', his slick, macking on "I Might" and the mature, articulate croons of "Angel" expose a charming facet of his artistry.  Still, Brown's vocals dance in unison with his sprightly guitar, a manifestation of George Benson's influence.  His guitar strums speak emotions loud enough to feel on standout instrumentals like "Missin' You."  When he abandons an established melody for a freestyle jaunt, as on the breezy groove "Up 'N' At 'Em," Brown is at his best.  
 These songs are his greatst.He picked great songs for Greatest Hits 
 The Right Moment details the governor's race in 1966 with Pat Brown (the incumbent) against a political newcomer, one Ronald Reagan. I thoroughly enjoyed this book for one major fact: It wasn't all about Reagan.  Writing books about Reagan is a cottage industry, and most of them, while not bad, rarely cover new territory. ("God and Reagan" by Paul Kengor being one of the few recent exceptions.) I started this book expecting it to be another cheerleading Reagan-was-great gloss-over.  Thankfully, it's anything but. While it does detail Reagan's ascendancy in the conservative movement (and, not incidentally, his discarding of his liberal past) and his subsequent race for the governorship, it is more about California politics in general and the disintegration of Pat Brown's stewardship.  It has what every election book has: the personality profiles of the political bosses, the attempts of primary challengers to knock out the inevitable winner, the gaffes and "defining" moments that seem ridiculously banal thirty years hence; and the culminating victory.  There are only two disappointments. One is there is very little detailing the mixing of Hollywood and California politics. Many believe that Reagan was the first, and he was the most important. However, George Murphy ("a song-and-dance man") became a hard-right senator before Reagan even "converted" to politics, and he gets scant mention. And Helen Gahagan is ignored as well. This isn't a book about Hollywood and politics, but it was an important enough phenomenon it might have been given a bit more consideration.  The other miss is the "election roundup" common in books of this type; I like them. I would have been interested to know where in California he had pulled his support--both geographically and demographically. There's a little bit at the end but not much.  Thankfully, one thing that is left out is the expected "and this was the start of something big" nonsense. While true, it could degenerate into a love feast with the same platitudes you read in other Reagan books. There is no such section in this book, which increases its quality.  People might dismiss this book as a Reagan book, and in reality it's not. It is an excellent portal into a small fraction of a very influential movement. 
 This is by far one of the best CD's ever composed by Bright Eyes. One of the greatest things about this album is that Conor Oberst sings all of his songs with such emotion that you can actually feel what he's singing and his lyrics are poetic enough so send chills down your spine. I personally related to "If Winter Ends" which is track one on the CD and I beleive that everybody has felt that way at one point or another. "Letting off the Happiness" also has a healthy mix of songs you can lay back and relax to(like "Sail Away", "If winter ends", "Contrast and Compare"), and songs that are more upbeat like "the city has sex" and "pull my hair". The entire CD has a mellow, yet very awake indie/folk vibe to it. I highly recomend it 
 What a fine album this one is.  One of Harrison's best.  "Cloud Nine", "This Is Love" and "When We Was Fab" are some of George's best work.  "Got My Mind Set On You" is a really strong song but it got a little over-played at the time.  The best of the second tier is "That's What It Takes".  You better believe this CD is a buy 
 this movie is a great movie for those how like movie on millitary and sub's. this movie keeps u thinking all the way through it and wondering what will happen next.Sean Connery as always was a great actor in this film and so was Alec Baldwin. I would just sugest it to just about anyone and definetly military lovers.  
 I have been using honing stone and I am also proud for being able to sharpen all my knives with the stone (except for the serrated ones).  Then I gave this thing a try and wow ! it works, consistently and with ease.  When using a honing stone, it is hard to maintain the correct edge angle, and this device takes the guess work out.  A friend of mine thinks his buck knife is sharp until he reset the edge with Wustof's stage 1 carbide edger and then hone it with the stage 2 ceramic sharpener.  Then he was surprised with how his "new" knife shred paper like razor.  Then we tried with the scissors and learned that the specially shaped slot should prevent one from inserting the scissors in a wrong way (right handed vs. left handed scissors).  Quality is great.  Comes with non-slip padding on the grip as well as several other sides so you can grip it and hold in down on the counter top in several positions/ways steadily.  Downside is that it is a bit pricey.  There are cheaper ones out there which I believe would work similarly but would probably lack the little quality touches here and there. 
 I have always thought that the 1930's were the most interesting times in the 20th century to study. So, much was changing in the world and so much in the United States. Danny Garvey, the main character, is a boy who trys to live through these hard times with all the courage he can muster,looking after Ma and little Maureen. His Pa, Daniel , senior is a man torn between staying with his family and looking for a job. Molly, the mother, has to hold together her family and support it at the same time. Maggie, the next door neighbor girl, is as tough as nails and sweet on Danny.Hank, the Okie, comes into Danny's life at a diffucult time to help out. Mr. Weissman is a store owner just trying to make it. Mrs. Riley, Maggies's Mom, raising 7 kids through the Depression and an abusive alcholic husband.  This book really captures the Depressiona and the peole who lived through it. Jackie Koller makes this time period real for kids and adults who are lucky enough to pick up her book. IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE KNOWN THESE CHARACTERS!!! 
 My two year old daughter has adored Weebles since her first birthday.  Every few months we give her another set of Weebles to add to her collection.  This set, like all the rest, was a big hit!  The set includes three Weebles figures:  Little Red Riding Hood, The Wolf, and the Woodsman.  She plays with them in the Weebelot Castle and the Weebly Wobbly Tree House, which are both loads of fun 
 This movie is incredible.  The story had me riveted from the beginning.  A cosmic version of the movie Crash on a grander scale.  This journey takes us to many different parts of the world.  The cinematography is wonderful and the grittiness is so very real.  In this movie you are not getting a santized view of the world we live in.  This movie is so much bigger than just Brad Pitt.    In Babel we are quickly thrust into a series of terrible events that seems to have no end.  Just when you are hoping for something to turn better it doesn't.  From the beginning portrayl of two Morrocan brothers who are entrusted to take care of the families livelihood it becomes apparent how much children are the same.  The wonderful acting almost had me feeling the warm air of the desert as I began to feel if I was there.  I quickly felt a lump in my stomach as the inevitable happens and the horrendous journey begins.  I will save the story for you the viewer but please be ready from an emotional joyride.  What I think captivated me most was that Babel wasn't watered down.  It was real, incredibely real.  From the Middle East, to Japan, and then to Mexico the stories seemed almost to real.  Combined with the acting I was quickly thrown over the edge.  It's almost hard to imagine the magnitude of such a film bringing so many cultures together.  Yet it did and it did very well.  Everyone played a part that you could imagine would be real.  Overall this movie is a must see.  Don't get ready for some happy celebration that will make you feel good.  This movie is distrubing...and if your not paying attention you will miss something.  Your not going to find much lighthearted fun.  Even when there is a joyful scene a serious touch of reality comes.  When you see children playing a game where they attempt to catch a chicken that goes from excitment to grief on the child's face when they see the real fate of the chicken they just caught.  The Blu-ray version won't leave you stunned for the most part.  It lacks any special features that would make it stand out.  The hd picture is okay but not stunning.  I would say if cosmetics aren't very big for you to go get the standard dvd version.  Generally this movie is worth many awards and hopefully it gets it's place in cinematic history 
 I was a skeptic and not a mother, but was still told that this cream is meant for anybody with stretch marks. So I had to try this stuff out. I was so amazed that this stuff started working in a few days. When I noticed such quick fading of the stretch markes around my stomach and my shoulder joints I was impressed I could actually see normal skin, I was thrilled and have told everybody I know about this stuff. This stuff is also good for dry skin and sunburns, I had to test out the possibilities and the stuff works like magic. I don't know how they formulated this stuff but after all these years somebody finally got it right 
 This book is a "must have" for any serious Egyptological library.  The fact that an excellent, modern Egyptologist such as Dr. Zahi Hawass has also contributed to the findings makes it even more valuable, and clearly shows that Egyptology is a constantly revised, dynamic area of study 
 I just bought this book for my 4-year-old son (and myself!).  He loves it.  The book is about cable cars in San Francisco and is practically a history lesson.  It's also fun 
 A quick and easy read with plenty of interesting results gained from medical research in the last century.  Particularly fascinating are the chapters on the unfolding mind (ch 2), remembering (ch 3) and how sight works (ch 7).  Reads a bit like a documentary which isn't surprising given it is adapted from a BBC series.  This book was very enjoyable and has inspired me to get hold of something similar with more depth 
 A well of information for the Dungeon Master and adventure gamer in this TSR AD&D resource!  Imagine - no more page turning when it comes time for that random encounter: all pertinent material regarding "dungeon  denizens" is included here in a handy "removable"  three-ring-binder format.  Appropriate monster sheets containing everything  from appearance and combat to diet and treasure can be removed from the  alphabetical guide and prepared for gaming encounters.  The only downside  I've experienced stems from the fact that there are many seperate  appendixes and supplements available you'll want for adventures outside the  "standard" monster encounters.  The basic volume does incorporate  quite a variety of creatures and will certainly come in handy for gameplay 
 A MUST read for gardeners and non-gardeners alike! This has been my absolute favorite of all the Chicken Soup books so far. I think it will outsell all of the other books because  gardeners and Chicken Soup fans tend to be of like spirit. Every story made me cry but yet left me feeling good, in true Chicken Soup style!!! Erma Bombeck and Nelson Mandela were a real treat 
 The book's time frame was right about 100 yrs ago, the market terms were different, company names were out, technology was ancient (that time you track transactions by paper tapes, telexes), BUT yet as said in the book - market nature never change, human nature never change, greed and fear are the same as always.    The book just covered how a dedicated person survived the ups and downs in the market.  May be he was so dedicated because trading was the only thing he knew, he did that since he was 15, that gave you no choice but to put all of you in, then after many crashes, he learnt how to drive - safely and profitably.  Ought to read this either you are doing very well in the market or getting discouraged, as you will learn you can easily be switching between these 2 situations like Mr. Livingston in the book.   
 Only one regret...that this wasn't made into a complete book!  The story was typical Bentley Little [although he didn't think so], fast paced, full of suspense, and a twisted ending...I gulped it down like a cold glass of water on a hot day....fast and smoothly, wanting more. I was extremely sad to have it end so quickly, but then again that's what "Shorts" means huh..lol...still I would gladly have bought this in a "long" book format.  Great, great story line!  Loved it!!!!! 
  Thomas Harris shoves the horrible side of his characters in your face for the first part of his book.  By the end you have seen all sides of them and never want to let them go 
 There are plenty of good summaries of this book here, so I'll briefly make one point:  this book is a good read, but the business climate has changed dramatically since it was written, and many of the characters here are retired or have moved to very different investing styles.  So the book is worth reading, but I'm not convinced it is as timely as say Lowenstein's books on the Internet bubble or Hedge Funds, or any of the many Enron books out now 
 As hopeless as a town that will always burn.  Doctrow's novel is sleek and powerful, not just an American story, but the story of all society, building up and breaking down, of the dirty nature of the human soul, and the little spots of light that try to burn bright; a story in which the democratic mass is dangerous and the philosopher king is not as powerful as he aught to be, and the Bad Man from Bodie, like the Lord of the Flies, is not only always waiting to ride down from the mountain, but resides in most every human heart.  Still, it is an essentially American novel and pays particular interest to deconstructing the Myth of the American West, a kind of anit-Shane. 
 This book is great for getting a bird's eye of the Cuban Revolution from an individual perspective.  Guevara is meticulous in his notation of events and people.  This is not the book to read if you are looking for a general study of the Revolution.  Guevara does speak of Castro and Cienfuegos among others but this is Guevara's story.  What most impressed me was his honesty about his men, his mistakes, and the conditions under which the Revolution occured.  The bugs, the heat, the lack of food, the support from the residents of the Sierra Maestro are so well described that you truly get a sense of what the experience must have been like.  Don't pass this book up 
 Shooting at the Moon is a book covering the US military war in Laos. Though some information is passed upon the war in Vietnam or Cambodia, the details are few and only mentioned when having an impact on the Laos war. Good descriptions are made on all the main characters involved and the war is covered both on the washington perspective and on the agents on the field. Only the effects on the civilian population is missing. A short summary is done on what happened after the war, on the further destinies on the peoples involved, on Laos and the refugees in Thailand. No real mention is done about the royalist puppet government of the US, other than a futile attempt to forbid US to do massive bombing flights. There is barely any mention on US activities apart from the military, such as factfinding, espionage and interrogation techniques.   Writing: 5/5  The book is an enjoyable read, well written with an easy to understand chronology. It is written not as an ordinary fact book, but more as a story about the americans involved in the secret wars of Laos. There are few direct quotes and the footnotes hardly points out which facts are received from whom. This is understandable, as many of the sources to the book are still working for CIA and don't want their names tied to some given fact. The the war in Laos is still a touchy subject. You get a feeling of all the main characters in the book, understanding why they took the decisions they did. Also, you get emotionally involved with the american allies in Laos, the Hmong people (in the book known as Meo), how they are used in the war and ultimately betrayed   as the US sees bigger gains to be had by abandoning the people that have been fighting for them.   Facts: 4/5  There is no doubt that this book has been well researched. There is a wealth of information on the persons involved, the most important events, which types of weapons were used, the strategies involved and on all things military. The problems comes   mostly when the author alleges things that aren't directly connected to the Laos wars. At one place he tells us that the CIA has never been involved in drug dealing, even if that has thoroughly documented in books like Alfred W. McCoys The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, Central America, Columbia. He states that the US had little to with when in 1965, the military regime of Indonesia slaughtered 300 000 indonesians, even though CIA was largely involved in the overthrow of the left-wing government of Sukarno, compiling lists of dissidents and turning them over to the right-wing generals. At another time, the author chides the CIA:s excessive caution regarding the bloody regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, but never mentions that the US supported the Khmer Rogue regime with food and medicines to be used as a buffer against the Vietnamese. These are details, but as all these details show a will to hide the dirtier side of the CIA war, one wonders what else has been missed in the book.   Balance: 3/5  This is a book purely from an american perspective, although their Hmong allies are covered quite well. No greater depth goes into anyone fighting on the enemy side, no commanders are mentioned and the civilians (apart from the Hmong) aren't mentioned more than perhaps 2-3 times. This onesidedness are displayed directly in the first chapter describing a coupe in 1960 against the american backed royalist government in favour for a more neutral government, somewhere between the americans and the vietnamese. No where is it mentioned that this was in fact a counter coupe to when general Phoumi, with US help, rigged the ballots in 1958 to throw out the 21 leftist candidates from the national assemby.  However, this bias is moslty in the selection of what to cover. No moral perspective is given on the use of Napalm, or bombing Laos with the equivalent of 25 Hiroshima bombs, as no moral judgement is passed on the vietnames disregard of peace treaties and borders. While the vietnamese recruiting to the army is called 'brainwashing', the Hmong side 'hard recruitment methods' are also mentioned. What is more suprising is when the author names the CIA officers involved as 'descent people', even though one of them collects the ears from dead enemies and thinks that the marines should be sent against antiwar protesters instead of national guard 'because the marines shot better' and another officer thinks that Vietnam, the country they suppousedly are helping, should be bombed into the stoneage.   The faults mentioned above do not, however, deduct from the generally good experience when reading the book, and the story is genuinely fascinating. I recommend everyone to read this book. One should complement this book with some on the rest of the vietnam war, mostly regarding the effects of the weapons used on the population, as those parts are severly lacking form this book. 
 Recently introduced to just a taste of Sarah Moon's work, I've been on the hunt for more without any luck... until now. After searching for past editions of her books, only to find seemingly unobtainable used copies, I was even more intrigued to see the long awaited release of Coincidences. Well, my wait has ended. Finally being able to feel the weight of a serious body of work encased in the refined texture of the robust cover, I carefully started turning the silky smooth pages. Stunning. Image after beautiful image held my gaze as my heart started to race in anticipation of the next. Every piece holds true to her glowing reputation to produce visually textured, emotionally layered works of art. The pace and flow of the eleven "chapters" will keep your thirst for beauty fully quenched. Brilliant forms of vibrant color adorne the works in chapter 6. Oh, to see through the eyes of Sarah! The supreme quality, not to mention the quantity of works, makes this fabulous find cheap at twice the price. Enjoy 
 I've bought this toy for my daugther ( she's 6 ) and she loves it, it's a good toy to use alone, to share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ). It's a good option to the computer, she also carries this toy with her stuff when she goes outside 
 Tiesto's ISOS 3 Panama is the best flowing album in the world I challenge anyone out there to prove me wrong its also Tiesto best work to date.This album gets played every day without fail and still feels like the first time im hearing all of the tracks on it. EPIC!!!.Just puts you in a perfect blend of beautiful music and deep progressive sounds that take you away. Going though all 15 tracks with detail. 1 - Noa Assembly  - Into The Fire this track is Perfect thats all there is to say ive personally listened to it over 1000 times and just keeps getting better with every listen esp: with the perfect no1 mix into 2 - DJ Hooligans  - Hear You Now (GRand Chillas Remix)which i think is the best mix that Tiesto has ever done these two tracks just go together so well and flow perfect puts you into a deep trance that will leave you speachless. Track 5 - Solarstone - Solarcoaster is awsome beautiful short vocals and an out of this world feel to it straight into Track 6 - Tremor - Mia luia - One of the my personal favs almost a tribal forest sound to it flows just perfect till we get to Track 7 - Tiesto - In My Memory (Gabriel & Dresden Elephant Remix) which I just cant find the words for. But when It's Tij's Gabriel Dresden on the sam track with Vocals from Nicola Hichcock its going to be EPIC everytime. Track 8 - Your Body Is A Temple gives you a deep feel with a massive vision I love this track so much thankyou Tij's for including it one of my favs never stop playing it:Track 9 - World Clique - Don't Do It is awsome so smooth and a range of riffs and sounds that keep you hooked the perfect set up for the beautiful. Track 10 - Chiller Twist - Stringz ULTD (Shelly Mix) which is in my top 10 tracks of all time everytimne I listen to this I smile beautiful voice and breakdown with the perfect blend of sounds and riffs which make this a top track for all Tiesto fans when this got released this was Tiesto fav track listen to it and see why,  Then we have track 11 - Paul Oakenfold - Southern Sun (Dj Tiesto Mix) quite possible for this to be the biggest Tiesto Remix release to date (Apart from Silence which is unbeatable and unmatchable) Perfect sounds Perfect vocals but when you think it was an Oaky track remixed by Tiesto you have to know that it was never going to be nothing but the best. this cd I could go on for forever but ill let the music do the rest of the talking. Thankyou Tiesto for this album and making the dreams for your fans come true.   
 I really enjoyed this Lackey book and have purchased others in the series.  I love all of Mercedes Lackey's offerings and look forward to anything new 
 The transaction was the best; the quality of the book was A++; and the purpose of purchasing this volume was more than met.  The subject matter is perfect for the purpose for which I purchased it.  Thanks. 
 This book is a great trip through the 80's and really is an insight into the world that was so much fun in NYC. Thankfully, it's too heavy for anyone to steal it from my coffee table but it does provide quite fun enterntainment! The photos are really great and the quotes are so cool -- I can't wait for McMullan's so9o's to come out 
 I can't say enough good things about "Braveheart". After watching it several times through the years, it's still inspiring, moving and heart-felt. This is definitely a movie that I'd recommend anyone to buy or at least watch 
 I love the concept of a slow cooker. I love the idea of being able to dump some ingredients in, leave it all day, and come back to a tender, delicious meal. But somehow it almost never seems to work out that way.     We've tried all sorts of slow cooker recipes over the years; almost every one comes out tasting very bland. Or the flavors get jammed together and you lose the subtlety and richness you'd get out of a "normal" recipe. Or the recipe author solved the lack of flavor by finding a strong ingredient or two and pouring them on, producing a dish with a very unbalanced taste. Finally we stumbled across "The Everything Slow Cooker Cookbook," and we found recipes we actually liked.  The book provides an unusual variety of recipes, for a slow cooker cookbook at least. There isn't as much as a regular cookbook, but then most slow cooker recipes out there are variations on stew or pot roast, so I'll take what I can get. There's a serious limit on what you can do with this kind of cooking appliance so you can't really expect the variety of a generic cookbook.  The author provides information on how slow cookers affect the flavors of things like spices and aromatic vegetables (this makes it much easier to adjust recipes to your taste). She also gives information on converting regular recipes to the slow cooker. These pieces of information alone make this book valuable.  She also has a good sense of flavor, in my opinion. I've always thought I *should* like baked beans, based on the ingredients, but I couldn't find a version that appealed to me. I've made the two versions from this cookbook and they were both delightful! We've made other things as well, including soups and a rice pudding, and all of them came out quite well. My only issue with them is that some of them didn't store well at all, which can be a pain when you're making an entire crock-pot's worth of food. Also, the author sometimes drastically underestimates the number of servings, I think (but better that than over-estimating...).  For the life of me I can't figure out why the author converted things like cookie recipes to the slow cooker, but oh well. These recipes don't take up that much space. Other than the storage issues we've really enjoyed this cookbook. The flavors are very good, the recipes are straightforward, the information is comprehensive, and the variety and number of recipes is extensive. If you want the convenience of a slow cooker but don't like typical slow cooker recipes, this is a very good cookbook to try 
 This book is a nice collection of what should be common sense rules (obviously common sense is not so common, as the examples of actual web sites in the book prove). I would assume that it would be most beneficial to a beginning designer, although it's a book everyone involved with web design or programming should browse through every now and then 
 Avishai opens the heart of the listener through his divine sounds.  The music is so sweet and soulful and so intellectually stimulating. Some classic styles and sounds revisited and some new sounds introduced.  This is a must listen for anyone interested in Avishai's music and any fan of jazz. What a treat! Thanks Avishai. ShalOM OM OM 
 This DVD I thought truly captured the essence of acceptance of those who are "different".. it shows acceptance concerning sexuality, racial differences etc.. It makes you realize, when it all comes down to it, people are all the same no matter who we are. Everyone just wants and deserves the right to feel accepted, love and happiness. I feel it's a great dvd to help open the minds of those who may be "homophobic" ... it'll help them see that people just want to live their lives the best way they can without having to feel discrimination of any kind. The DVD made me cry, laugh out loud and smile. It showed me that there are so many others out there like me who I can relate to, and for that alone, I give this DVD 5 stars! Bravo! 
 no complaints! good quality, easy to put together and larger than I had expected 
 As a longtime fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan, I had the priviledge of seeing him play live at one of his last gigs.  As always, he was brilliant.  As time went on throughout his career, he began to experiment and expand a bit with new ideas, musicians, etc...  But not here.  This album is raw, unadulterated, straight-ahead, ballsy blues guitar playing from a young Stevie Ray, who emerged onto the music scene fully formed and ready for business.  Listening to IN THE BEGINNING, I feel like I'm right there in the audience.  It confirms that Stevie Ray's playing was more than just something he learned to do.  It's who he was, 24 hours a day.  
 I'm Orthodox but I do appreciate the beauty and timeless wonder of the Authorised Version-King James Bible.  
 Typee was a difficult book to read but worth the effort. There isn't much plot beyond "Tommo's" rehabilitation at the hands of the Typee and his fears that they might be cannibals. Is he being nursed back to health or fattened for a future supper? As with Moby Dick, the bulk of the text is in the form of essay and commentary. There are lengthy discussions on the language, the architecture, the music (or lack thereof), taboos and tatoos, and diet of the Typee. These extra chapters though don't have the humor that is present in Moby Dick. They are still an interesting observation on one subset of Polynesian culture 
 I first read "Great Comedians" in 1972 when I was starting out as a comedian.  I found it to be just what I needed as a young aspiring comedian.  The interviews of Woody Allen, Shelley Berman, Jack Benny, and Phillis Diller resonated with me and helped me immensely in my standup comedy development.  It also inspired me to write my own book probing the methods of my generations great comedians ("Comic Insights") in order to help today's young comedians get a better idea of what it takes to do quality standup.  I recently read "Great Comedians" again, and my original verdict still stands.  This book is still of immense value to all aspiring comedians 
 NYPD Battles Crime recognizes that by admitting things are not "all right", that there are problems waiting for solution, we can move onto what may be reasonable and realistic remedies to the crisis at hand. "It was hard to argue that averting crime, even nuisance crime or incivility, before it erupts is better than reacting to ongoing, more violent criminal activity." Pp 79-80.   The three main objectives for an Intelligence Led campaign in law enforcement where a serious or increasing degree of criminal threat is perceived, which is what Compstat is really all about are as follows.  Government officials must begin by eliminating perceived injustices. Previously, and even more so today, the inequalities of cultures must be studied, and understood within the context of the indigenous perspective i.e., avoid mirror imaging. It is vital that western democratic policymakers have adequate intelligence so as not to underestimate security challenges. The disparity between Western material and technological advantages with those of opposing cultures defines the crises.  "The NYPD and organizations emulating its successes are undergoing a revolutionary change - a new way of relating to their environment." P 186.  Law Enforcement Intelligence must also focus on the emerging domestic threat generated, and propelled by the multicultural mentality that renders logical decisions impossible. This particular `group-think' mentality espouses inexplicable virtue on non-Western societies whom proudly profess a real threat. It is the essence for fostering unconventional warfare, terrorism, and globally organized crime.  Prior to Compstat ..."An assemblage of field soldiers and officers, as in the first act of Aida, would deliver on the top command's promise to dramatically reduce crime. But the stumbling of previous reform administrations on a stage replete with bureaucratic land mines and social `snafus' had shown the need for more deftness and sophistication in reconfiguring the NYPD bureaucracy." P 82.  Almost simultaneously, the government must obtain support of the local citizenry, separating the criminal threat from the general population, as much as possible, both physically and psychologically.   Strategic policy should consider when implementing a counterinsurgency campaign against criminality and incivility that personnel develop a sincere empathy for the public they serve. When forces are scattered among, and living with, the population, they need not be told any longer that they have to win their support. Being more vulnerable, they realize instinctively that their own safety depends on good relations with the local people. Civil, respectful behavior will come about naturally on their part.   Finally, law enforcement must develop the necessary intelligence to establish a policy whereby future criminality will not threaten the newly established civility. There are plausible reasons to believe that the majority of citizens support or are at least sympathetic to the counterinsurgent forces. However, the residents in a high crime/combat area usually avoid contact with them. The barrier between the lawful citizen and the counterinsurgent must be broken. Fostering a sense of self-preservation should dissolve the separation between the counterinsurgent and law abiding citizen. Too often residents fear reprisals from the criminal element and with good reason doubt there is adequate defense from counterinsurgent forces. Only when the tables are turned; when the counterinsurgents hold the upper hand on controlling violence, and only after the local resident has been adequately enabled to control his own safety will there be open communication between the counterinsurgents and citizens.  This work with its historical depiction of how Compstat was developed is very helpful in studying and understanding Intelligence Led Policing.  
 for the longest time i just listened to 'Moondance', 'Tupelo Honey', etc.  i.e. the early stuff.  imagine my surprise when i picked this record up and found it to be on par with his classics of yesteryear!  every song is amazing; the production is tops; do yourself a favor and pick up this gem 
 HOLY [...]!  I have read and listened to countless books and tapes on becoming wealthy, and they somewhat helped.  After reading this book I realized that my thought pattern was the reason for the delay in becoming wealthy.  This book has pushed me to go to the edge of the box, and to change the way that I think by keeping my interest through the hilarious stories.  It is a must read for anyone who wants to be a billionaire 
 In this book, Hawking definitely succeeds at making one understand the very complex side of physics. I chose it in the hope of understanding Einstein's theory of relativity and black holes, the latter of which he describes well and the former of which he names often but does not explain. I found that although everything he mentions is fascinating and totally mind-boggling (such as the make-up of what we thought were indivisible atoms, the difference between real and virtual particles and waves, and his discussions of space-time and singularities and the expansion of the universe), many times it is not well-written  and can take a while to decipher, although the diagrams and other illstrations are, for the most part, pretty helpful. One thing that I found particularly annoying was his constant assertion of credibility - "... a position that Isaac Newton once held, and which is now my own ..." - we all know how ingenius Hawking is, its part of why we chose to read the book, right?  As the heading to this review implies, the book is gripping in a few parts but, in most, it requires a large amount of determination and a "want-to-know." If you're not interested in physics and astronomy and essential theory without proof (which can be quite frustrating), this book is not for you. But if you're looking for a better understanding of the when, where, how, why of the universe, I'd say give it a shot - you may enjoy it 
   Having spent a number of years in the fitness industry, I've come to realize that people know what is good, and what is bad, plus what they are supposed to do.So it comes down to whether people are willing to make the necessary steps and changes towards the right direction.Bob has done an excellent job in bringing out the emotional aspect that has been missing in many fitness books.I like the idea of building some kind of structure, through behavior and then using it as a vehicle to get anywhere you wan 
 This is a book for Jews and Gentiles alike. Most of us non-jews have probably thought we had heard everything there is to know about Jewry in the 20th century from the numerous accounts of the Holocaust, the founding of Israel etc.  Not so!  This book looks at how East European jewry in the post-Czarist period found itself drawn to three rival and sometimes contending spiritual homelands. In short Revolutionary Russia, Zionism and Israel and immigrant America. Slezkine illustrates the tensions and interactions between the "three homelands".  Slezkine reminds us that there is a lot more to the Jewish story than the most well known themes. A fascinating read that helps the reader better understand how the 20th century unfolded 
 Classic Israel in a simple environment.....If you are a fan of IZ's music then you must have this DVD which showcases the music.  It's a simple concert and setting....which lends to the beauty.  I was at first very disappointed because I saw the list of contents and was thinking "wow, is that it?"....but that is the key to his style...simplicity and focus on the emotions. I've played through it, and played through it, and I can't seem to get tired of having it on.  It's an experience to listen to him sing and his team supports all of his elements.  We had the pleasure of being in Hawaii in August'06 and this music helps keep our memories alive.  
  Like many other readers, I agree with the reviewer who said that this book has 'revolutionary implications' for humanity and the sciences. I read the first edition - years back, and in its own way, it changed my entire perspective on life. One reviewer abandoned it as 'hippy dippy' nonsense - but, such ideas have been heeded and used in Asia, for millennia. Sorry, but 'hippies' did not invent it. Until modern times, such wisdom regulated the lay out of temples, even whole towns in  Asia. Rather like acupuncture - the principles involved with 'feng-shui - ley-lines (lung-mei in China) defy strict logic - but, they can be divined in other ways - and work!    A word of caution, however. More than a few people refer to this lost-art as 'earth science' - but, that's too simplistic. From the Chinese point of view, it is an interplay between celestial and terrestrial energy (chi), and it seems that the caucasian practitioners of yore viewed it the same way.    It is not entirely lost to Western people. When push comes to shove, hard-headed business people in Australia have paid diviners to 'dowse' for water - and they are usually successful.  'Dowsing' is but one element - but it is a good place to put 'theory' to the test. As supplementary reading, I recommend Guy Underwood's 'Patterns of the Past' - because he 'dowsed' and mapped the energy-fields around many megalithic sites, cathedrals etc. - with fascinating results. At one time, the Russian Academy of Science sponsored research into such things, finding what were termed 'black pools' - nodes of negative energy which exerted a harmful effect upon humans, animals and plants. John Michell's 'The View Over Atlantis' was a ground-breaking work - and it is good to see this new edition. Given the worsening picture - environmentally, it seems timely to review ways of thinking, taking man's interdependence with the terrestrial and celestial forces into account. The 'chopped logic' which has governed life since the Industrial Revolution can no longer serve us. Modern physics tells us that the perceived boundaries between things - are largely illusory, and we should explore the prospect of re-alligning science with the wisdom of the ancients. We need scientists who are shamans, to see us through the next millennium and beyond.    
   This exceptional novel satisfies even the most knowledgable history buff with its accuracy and extensive bibliography while still containing the thrill of a John Crichton novel! Through several perspectives, Maier draws the reader into the scandals and perverseness of the a government guided by one man's insanity.    Ceaser Nero is of the purest emperial Roman blood. This makes him an equal to the gods themselves, or so he believes. Yet his diety is not enough to protect him from the arising coupes and scandals. He becomes suspicious of everyone, including his own mother. His suspicions turn to anger and this anger always ends in murder.    The climax of the book is attained when his anger becomes directed at an entire group of people, the Christians. As a result, Rome becomes a slaughterhouse of men, women, and children alike in unimmaginable brutality. This near annihlation of an entire religion left a deep scar which the world will remember...forever. 
 I love these shoes, they are so comfortable and give great support. These are my second pair. The merchant got them to me really fast and I appreciate that. Though when I ordered I thought the amazon site specified free shipping so I was surprised at that 
 If you are a fan of great disco music, then you will love this album. I heard "Shake Your Groove Thing" by Peaches and Herb for the first time after I bought this album 
 Personally speaking, I like a nice fairly straightforward thriller-type movie, with a little suspense, and a little romance, so this was up my ally!  The characters were amazingly well-developed I thought, given the genre, and their situation was really compelling.  Mimi Rogers was wonderful in her role-- not at all the "shallow" socialite stereotype, but a real person with real worries and real needs... Go ahead and check this one out if you're looking for a way to pass an evening!  But get the DVD if you can, I found the VHS to be pretty low quality 
 Needless to say, there are a multitude of leadership books out there.  However, "Real Leadership" was unique.  I found it readable and full of interesting examples about leadership on both the governmental and individual level.  Williams has had fascinating experiences as a consultant in various countries, and I appreciated the insights shared.   If you're like me and fascinated by human behavior and leadership, then I recommend this book 
 This album is unbelievable. I have owned Souvlaki for quite some time now and generally avoided this one due to some poor reviews I had read. However, I recently picked it up on cassette at amoeba and  I was blown away. It is easily better than souvlaki and one of, if not, the best dream-pop album of all time. The super-phased guitars will put you in a daze 
 This book was a tremendous blessing as I thought, prayed, and wrote about what I read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to make their art an expression of worship to their Creator 
 Do not be put off by the word extreme. This is an excellent full-length DVD on many excellent aspects of skydiving, freefalling, and includes many different uses for parachutes. The DVD is high-quality in that the viewer feels as if he/she is freefalling and parachuting along with the persons on the video. With "Freefall Extreme" you become part of this thrilling adventure 
      Definitely a classic.  Don't be put off by the warnings other reviewers have about unfamiliar words and phrases: like any great writer, Carlyle does the work of presenting every event and person in a way to give us a feel for what was going on--at least in his vision of what happened between 1789-94 in France.  The prose isn't straightforward, but you can get a summation of events straight from any encyclopedia or textbook: what Carlyle does is go much, much more in depth.  Terms like 'Sansculottism' or 'sea-green Robespierre' bring very vivid impressions by the time you get near the end, and his insights into character and motive are amazingly vivid (no wonder George Eliot was impressed!)      This history does indeed read like a novel, and it really is quite good.  Yes, there are unusual words and phrases (like Shakespeare, Carlyle coined and invented words, several now currently used in the language).  That's all part of the fun though.  The Modern Library edition has a good introduction, plus a timeline of events to orient you better while reading.      A very worthwhile and satisfactory book, current tastes not withstanding.                   
 These shoes are great.  If you have any problems with your feet, New Balance is the way to go.    But what was most impressive about this order was how quickly I received them.  I got them within a day or two.  I was very impressed 
 Byron Barton did an excellent job with this book. This is by far my son's favorite book. We have had it since he was [...]. At that time I had to read him the book at least 15 times each day. He will be [...] in July and he still chooses this book several times a week. Each time we must read it at least twice. The simple words and illustrations combined with the bold colors are great for retaining young people's interest. I have purchased 5 copies because we have literally worn the books out 
 I happily discovered this album by accident at the Borders in Chicago back in the summer of '98 and it has since become one of the more favorite offbeat albums in my collection. The music is at once funky, energetic, bouncy, and plain out fun. "Salty Peanuts/Chocolate Covered Nut" and "Cabbage Roll" are both upbeat and fun songs that show that rhyming (adequately handled by the Dirty MF on MC duty) can go quite well with a jazzy beat. There are also some great slowed down R&Bish tracks like "I Want You To Want Me", which is probably the best track on the album. Overall, this is a unique sound that any jazz fan should enjoy 
 I have a number of professional colleagues who have gone the route of becoming micro-ISVs or ISV (independent software vendors).  While I know it's a lot of work, I don't think I realized exactly what all goes into that.  Bob Walsh has what I would consider a "must read" title if you're in that area or thinking of going down that path...  Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality.  Contents:  Having a Vision; Developing the Micro-ISV Way; Presenting the Product; Business is Business; Focusing on the Customer; Welcome to Your Industry; What Happens Next?; Appendix; Index  The fact I'm reading this doesn't mean I'm contemplating quitting my day job.  :)  Apress sent me the book and it looked interesting enough that it ended up in my backpack for reading while at work.  What I found inside was a lot of wisdom and advice that can give the small entrepreneur a fighting chance to succeed on their own.  Not only has Walsh traveled this path before, but he's enlisted the advice of a number of other successful micro-ISVs in the way of stories and interviews.  The overall result is that you get an extremely realistic view of what you will encounter if you choose this path.  He deals with everything from the motivation behind the decision to launch your own business, to best practices in setting up your development environment to lay the groundwork for future growth (and less headaches), to how coexist with the 800-pound gorilla in the room known as Microsoft.  Even if you're not thinking of going independent, there are a number of websites he covers that are nearly worth the price of the book.  For instance, there are sites where you can get stock photography to use to create nice websites (without paying a bundle in royalties).  There are sites that cover the competitive landscape of your customers and competitors, which is just good business practice to follow regardless of who's writing your paycheck.  He even talks about how you can set up automated feeds to scan for mentions of your site/company/product in news and blogs.  Again, an excellent practice to follow for more than just small development companies.  This is one of those books that goes on a short "homework" pile for me.  Now that I've read the book, I need to go back through it at my computer and bookmark the sites that grabbed my attention.  And if I were ever to contemplate striking out on my own, my first task would be to re-read this book and start taking serious notes.  It's money well spent to swing the odds in your favor.  A recommended read.. 
 I was so impressed with this book that I wrote the following letter to its author:  I just completed your book Time Tactics of Very Successful People.  The book is truly a masterpiece, and I have found it immeasurably helpful in my ongoing pursuit to become the best person that I can be.  Your book is full of wisdom and great ideas, the value of which is many times the price I paid for the book.  I have read the works of personal development legends like Napoleon Hill, Brian Tracy, W. Clement Stone, Tony Robbins, Mark Victor Hansen and others and have benefited from all of them, but I really enjoyed reading your book because I found that you offered some fresh ideas that these other great men did not. I am sure that the extraordinary concepts your book provides will enrich my spirit, enlighten my mind, and serve as conduits for achieving my goals for the rest of my life. I really liked the way that you ended the book.  The quote you gave from Earl Nightengale perfectly reflects my philosophy for successful living, but helped me crystallize my thinking in a way that has helped refines my philosophy further.     Thanks again for providing the world such a valuable resource, a guide which I am certain has helped and will continue to help many others to live happier, more productive, and more peaceful lives.  
 There is a reason for the caps in the subject heading, but you will have to read the book to discover it.  The fourth Discworld installment is similar to the others in its wit and humor.  Terry Pratchett has a gift for using the pen to create humor.  The following is an example of the humor employed in this book, "Mort was interested in lots of things...there was the puzzle of why the sun came out during the day, instead of at night when the light would come in useful. He knew the standard explanation, which somehow didn't seem satisfying."  A skilled humorist, it could also be said that the discworld books lack an interesting story.  No one combines sci-fi humor and plot better than Douglas Adams, and the discworld books aren't on par with Adams' standard, but the comedy level of this discworld book and the others meet or exceed that of Adams' books.    This story is different from the others in that many new characters are introduced.  The main character (death's apprentice) is new.  The main character's boss, death, has only made a few short appearances in the past Discworld books.  The likable main character from the first two books, Rincewind, makes a short appearance, but the majority of the characters are brand new.  These characters, and most of the characters created by Pratchett, are developed well.  The imagination can swirl around these characters in a way that makes the reader eager to discover the next page.  Summed up, this book is great in its character development and humor but it maybe lacks in the plot development department.  
 It is a beautiful kitchen - my 3yo loves it - I bought  a lot of food and stuff to go with it and she gets a total kick out of it.  The microwave plastic came cracked and it was so involved putting it together that we didn't bother un assembling it and sending it back 
 I believe this is known as the first official known documentary film. Like all good documentaries, it was able to make me, the viewer, relate to the subject. I was able to empathize and feel for the plight of Nanook and his family. Such a classic 
 this is a great product if you have allergies or sinus problems, this will make a difference i breath normally at night and it helps cut down on the numerous colds and sinus infections i am prone t 
 My preschool son is a real animal lover and I had been searching for a book like this for ages.  It has photos of heaps of animals and not too much text, so is just right for younger kids.  My little boy got it out of  the library and wanted to take it everywhere with him, learn all the  animals' names and draw them.  I would highly recommend this book for any  animal loving child 
 i really like carole matthews's books, but a little dissapointed when i ended this book it didnt have the same "this was a great book" feeling. 
 Judy and Gloria have done it again!  They've boiled down all the obfuscations of the net into discussions that quilters will enjoy. They offer their picks for the best Web sites to find free patterns, free  quilting how-tos, and even free stuff for doll-makers. It would be hard to  find this kind of stuff with a searcher.  The net information in this book  is completely different from what's in their Quilter's Computer Companion.   That's a good book too, but this is more updated and complete.  This is a  very easy book to read, learn from and enjoy 
 This book, written in a flowing conversational style, has 7 sections: an introduction, an extremely fine rendition of Buddhist psychology-aimed at human emotions, the "current situation" on cyclic existence/karma, the future-Buddhahood, the path to take, the past-brief Buddhist history; &  conclusion.  Overall, it's a very fine introduction to basic Buddhism & a terrific companion to Ven. Chodron's Q&A "Buddhism for Beginners" & "Working with Anger."  While the author is a Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhist Bhikshuni (ordained nun), the book is more generic.  The pp. 25-80 psychology portion is convincing: e.g. p. 40: "The sources of the pain & confusion are our own biased projections & the selfish expectations we've placed on others," but goes a bit far, stating p. 77: "all problems arise from the self-cherishing attitude."  Later sections present std. Buddhist doctrines, dogmas, mythology, & terminology-very different from the psychology section.  For example, as I read Websters, "kindness" implies intention; while one can be grateful to another for some benefit, an unintended benefit is not a "kindness."  Similarly, p. 161 the discourse on emptiness ignores the mixed definition of "cracker"--Websters says it must be baked, it is not simply the sum of its parts + synergy is possible.  She has some questionable (though not unusual) assumptions-saying p. 196 there were no Buddhist wars (but the Gelugpas came to power over the Karmapa via Mongol military strength etc.).  The discussion on soul/self is also party line e.g. p. 163: "the Judeo-Christian idea of an eternal, unchanging soul" & p. 166: "the self still exists, but in a gentler & softer way.  It's merely a convention, not a real entity."  IMO it depends on one's definitions of words used.  This basic book doesn't address specific Vajrayana or Mahamudra perspectives, but Ven. Chodron says very valuable things when speaking for herself: p. 206: "Others may not be our relatives, but they are someone's parents & children.  They are the same in being parents & children, only the possessive pronoun describing them is different: `their' instead of `our.'  Once we recognize the arbitrariness of these labels `mine' & `others,' our love & compassion can spread to everyone impartially.  In this way, feelings of alienation & barriers between people fall away."  I find this observation very useful in developing lovingkindness, compassion, Bodhichitta & Tonglen & p. 209: per Lama Yeshe, "We do whatever we can, with whatever wisdom we have...to the best of our ability.  This in itself will be of enormous benefit to others; we don't need to wait until we become Buddhas before we can begin to act. 
 While I've heard a few tracks from this album, I'm still counting the coins to pay for it and its shipping.  To K. Owen, who focuses his review on how Vampire: the Masquerade has ruined the goth scene... I'd like to point out that this game isn't about being, or pretending that one is, a goth.  If some roleplayers have been attracted to the goth scene as a result of the game, perhaps it is because the themes of the game that they empathise with most, appear in some gothic music as well. Or, perhaps the goth scene, at least superficially, presents itself as suitable to the game setting.  I would think you should be glad if the game has inspired more people to identify with at least some elements of your *culture,* rather than harping on maintaining its purity, as you happen to define it. As with many subcultures, certain "imitations" of them are not imitations at all; rather, people who have been inspired into similar activities, but for completely different reasons.  In my case, I don't give a flying fang if the vampiric music I enjoy also grants me Exclusive and Optimum Goth Society Status; I like it for its themes of eternity, madness, politics and so on.  On whether this album does these themes justice, I will post at a later date...  Sabin 
 I could not put this book down!  I was so amazed with this shocking story that I bought several copies for gifts.  Reading this book was like watching a scary movie.  
 i'm sorry i can not review this product since i cancelled order and received a refund.please feel free to ask for a review of my other purchases 
 This expands and explains so much of the underlying story.  I only wish there was more!  This was the only CD in the player of my truck for 4 weeks!  I listened to it a bit at a time at least 5 times before even turning on the radio again!  Well made and executed drama 
 "In all likelihood, Jesus is permanently layered into the American cultural soil. Yet his identity is elastic. There is no single Jesus, in America or anywhere else," he writes.   This isn't the best church history I've read.  In fact it took me awhile to fall in love with it.  His humility and lack of stuffinss kept me reading.  But about a third of the way through he got me.  It is an impressionist work , so I'll give it a similarly disjointed, impresisonistic review.  Some random highlights for me:  p. 129: his take on Edwards joy in doing theology is better phrased than anything Marsden, Gerstner, I. Murray, Lee, McDermott or anybody else I've ever read on Edwards.  Its only a few paragraphs but it lit me up for hours.  p. 263: His thing on Hodge on Bushnell has been said before in bits and pieces by others.  But never so clearly and potently in such a short space.  I finally get it. For years I hated Bushnell (for reducing the faith to a socializing process); then when I finally began to shake off my revivalism I started to think I shouldn't have been so harsh on him.  Fox straightened me out in two paragraphs via Hodge.  p. 274: his sutble disdain for Henry Ward Beecher is wonderful.     p. 358 -- his thing on Niebuhr's appreciation for Edwards -- great.  p. 396 -- "evangelical Protestants like to ask 'What WOULD Jesus do?,' but many Catholics and non-evangelical Protestants prefer to ask "What DOES Jesus do?' "  p. 397 "Machen was naive, (Niebuhr) thought, to attack liberalism without also taking on the popular revivalists who did as much to undermine a proper respect for the supernatural as the liberals did.  Revivalists too were reducing the Gospel to a self-help creed, an empowerment doctrine adorned in pious trappings...."    I could go on like this.  This is a rather awful book if its the only American chucrh history you will read in a year or two.  But read critically it has a few dozen moments that will make it wwll worth it. 
 once youve read one story you have got to read them all, they go into detail about john and paul and its just great. theres stories for just about everything.  the pictures are clear and amazing, most, if not all of them you cannot find on the internet, this book is gigantic, almost the size of text books, which makes the pictures even more amazing.  you are not a beatles fan unless you have this book 
  I was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and/or loss; weight was incidental. In this fiercely intelligent novel, Dorothy and Justine are both desperately lonely women, both victims of abuse, and yet are different in other ways. Their parents often failed them, their childhood was often full of shame and self-sabotage, but Gaitskill writes this with complexity, always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer. Gaitskill is never sentimental. Underneath her narrative, underneath the pain and the sex scenes (which are never fully loving) and the disappointments and loneliness, is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect - on race, on class, but mostly on gender. I sensed that Anna Granite, the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative, and who is the reason Dorothy and Justine first meet, is Gaitskill's platform for displaying her keen intellect; and sometimes there is a hint of didactism. But this is a minor quibble. The last section moved me very much and proved that although Gaitskill abhors sentimentality, she can certainly do sentiment well. `Humanity' is a word often found in this book. Our sexuality is connected to our humanity. Our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human. In the end, Gaitskill's brilliant, wonderfully feminist novel was, for me, about how easily we strip each other of our humanity. 
 Louise Borden has added another little known story to her collection of historical fiction. In the year 1941, Holland has been under Nazi control for a year. Ten year old Piet dreams of following in the footsteps of his hero, Piiim Mulier the skater who first achieved Elfstedentocht, the Eleven Towns Race.  When a family friend is taken into German custody Piet's grandfather asks the boy to take the threatened family's children, down the frozen canals, to safety across the border to Brugge, Belguim. They are hoping three children skating down the canals will not attact the attention of the German troops. The journey becomes Piet's Elfstedentocht. The cold, the exhaustion, the fear and the natural exuberance of the children are beautifully shared in this story.  Niki Daly's illustrations have an old fashioned feel. Daly has caught the feeling of the Dutch winter sky and the era with muted colors.   Interesting notes on the Elfstedentocht are included along with pronounciations of the Dutch words. Another wonderful book about Holland during WWII is "Forging Freedom" by Hudson Talbott.  These two titles would work well together 
 I enjoyed this short mystery - the first featuring Anna Pigeon, park ranger/sleuth.  It's a classic whodunnit set in Guadalupe Mountains National Park.  Although I found the mystery predictable, Barr does have a better writing style than many mystery writers and the setting was original and interesting.  This series does appear to get even better as it proceeds - I'm liking the second Anna Pigeon book, A Death Superior, even better than Track of the Cat 
 The book is a good overview of Taguchi's methods with a few very good examples 
 This was an incredibly interesting book about one of the now-forgotten characters of American history.  The author does a great job in portraying Depression era Oklahoma, and how outlaws such as Pretty Boy Floyd came to  be. After reading this book, it is clear that Pretty Boy Floyd was a bandit  who had more in common with figures such as Jesse and Frank James than  contemporary gangsters such as Al Capone. I would highly recommend this  book to anyone interested in this period of Americana. The only flaw in  this book is the rather shallow characterization of Floyd himself. While  not quite whitewashing Pretty Boy Floyd, the author quickly glosses over  any negative characteristics while expounding on Floyd's positive traits  such as his generosity and good nature. In all likelihood Floyd was a  complex figure, and the book would have done greater service to his memory  had it presented a more balanced view 
 That such a simple, unpretentious book could be so healing.  This book helped me to live through the mysterious, dark cycles of my life and emerge into new life with health and vigor and new love.  The fact that I remember the lessons so many years later is quite a testament 
 the pendant was a little smaller than I expected, but lovely nonetheless 
 If you are familiar with the work of Strobel, this book will continue to impress you.  If you are not however, and would like to know where the author is coming from, I encourage you to read his previous works, "The Case for Christ" and "The Case for Faith" so that you might better understand Strobel.  Some people have condemned this book because Strobel doesn't present the evolutionary side well.  I have a few quick observations to make.  First of all, he's a journalist; he asks tough questions and, for the most part, gets good responses.  Second, everyone has an agenda, without exception.  Strobel, and those who he interviews, analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern Darwinian scientific views.  Finally, it is clear from the outset that Strobel wants to make a compelling case for ID.  This is not an unreasonable goal.  The fact that he doesn't interview evolutionists shouldn't bother anyone, based on his obvious objectives.  If you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a point-counter point series book.  If you want to understand the current ID debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator, this book is for you 
 This offering by BLS, recorded in Paris on the Mafia tour is by far their best so far: The overall Mix/Sound,Song Selection & Raw Energy are all in top form here ! Also of note to all Pantera/Metal fans is the inclusion of "In This River"- Zakk's moving tribute to his best friend,Dimebag Darrell. Highlights(there are plenty),include "Stoned And Drunk","Stillborn","Been A Long Time","Suicide Messiah","Funeral Bell","Fire It Up", AND MANY MORE ! The second disc is a four song set from London, which rounds out what is a blistering live set form Black Label and Co. Enjoy this one and marvel at the guitar alter of Zakk Wylde !! 
 Without scaring the reader through complex mathematics from page 1, Pierce introduces the subject in an intutive manner, which is the main strength of the Book. Any student interested in studying communication theory without  being scared away, should study this book firs 
 like the title says this book is great. its written by vets and other experts and has illustrations and quick reference charts. detailed pages on what seems to be a-z problems and is filled with fun and lesser known facts. as well as advice. its covers from the very beginning of getting a dog to when they get old. it also has first aid and basically everything you need to know as a dog owner. 
 Jimmy  Little  is  living   in  Harlem  New York. With  a  close  friend  to  his  mom Jimmy  is  doing fine. One  day  his dad  Crab shows   up  after  14 years.Jimmy  dads  wonts to take jimmy   with hime to Chicago.After that things  start  to go wrong  they both learn about each other.It is a  intense story  it keeps you wondering what  will happen.  I really liked  this book  be cause it takes you  on a wild  adventure.  
 Very helpful and a great deal of information. Has a gret deal of information for the novice who is beginning to build his layout 
 This is such a great book and one that I could truly relate to. I am a stay at home Mom to two wonderful children, ages 2 and 4. I could completely relate to Elisabeth's words. I appreciated her honesty as well. Wonderful 
 "In each of us lie good and bad, light and dark, art and pain, choice and regret, cruelty and sacrifice. We're each of us our own chiaroscuro, our own bit of illusion fighting to emerge into something solid, real. We've got to forgive ourselves that. I must remember to forgive myself. Because there's an awful lot of gray to work with. No one can live in the light the whole time."  This is my favorite quote from the book and I think it sums up the main point pretty nicely.   I loved this book - the author is amazing, the storyline multi-faceted, the characters well developed - and I gave it 4-1/2 stars. I would've given it 5 had it not been for some of the confusing scenes concerning the realms and its magic.  I would highly recommend this book to others and I have bought the second book in this trilogy, entitled Rebel Angels, so I can start reading it immediately!  The author Libba Bray was so convincing in her account of 1890's London that I assumed she was British - I was shocked to find out she is a Texan living in New York. She writes as if she had been a student at Spence Academy 
 THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES MY HUSBAND AND I RUINED MEAT AND VEGETABLES. WE ALWAYS HAD THE HEAT TOO HIGH OR LEFT THINGS ON THE GRILL FOR TOO LONG MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS COOKED THOROUGHLY. I EVEN SENT AWAY FOR THE THERMOMETER THAT YOU COULD GET PAYING FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING ONLY. I RECEIVED THE THERMOMETER PRETTY QUICK TOO AND IT WORKS GREAT. I HOPE THIS HELPS ANYONE THINKING OF BUYING ONE 
 Paula Mathieu's book is an informative, practical guide to academic-community partnerships. It has a warm, friendly tone which draws you in and inspires you to read on. There are several serious points made (of course!) throughout the book and some technical language, but it's lively and funny with a really hip touch. A must read for anyone with an ounce of social conscience. 
 Arguably Robert Heinlein's best work, STARSHIP TROOPERS is a classic piece of science fiction displaying an Earth of the future in a galactic war against a sentinel race of giant bugs that are set on destroying humankind.  The story is told through the eyes of Juan Rico, a member of the Mobile Infantry.  Rico explains how he joined MI, some of his adventures, and how he rose through the ranks.  STARSHIP TROOPERS is actually more a book of philosophy and military thought set against the backdrop of a society in which the only people who can vote are those who have served in the military (makes one think of the term "citizen soldiers" completely different).  As far as an action story, STARSHIP TROOPERS doesn't have much to offer.  Much of the book is given to dialogues explaining the philosophy the book promotes.  Also, many of the action scenes are more concerned with military strategy than describing action.  However, I have found that the most meaningful works of sci fi are those that deal with deep philosophical issues or social ills.  STARSHIP TROOPERS isn't for everyone.  However, it is a piece of classic sci-fi and is worth reading if you don't mind not having to read about a lot of action sequences 
 A good title, but State of Emergency is just as solid. Read them both 
 There's not a lot left to say about snow and ice... I enjoyed this novel, which is remarkable not only for its language (superb descriptions) but also for its lack of profanities, its avoidance of anything remotely sexual, its optimism... I began to think that I was perhaps in soft-sell religious territory. It emerges as one of those rare contemporary books which a Ned Flanders could give his boys to read... Well, all that aside, it is a fine narrative and the journey across the ice is a true literary tour de force.  
 A brilliant and lucid text that supplies enough theory over a wide range of topics, but also manages at the same time to emphasise the practical application of devices and circuit ideas.  Worked examples and useful data support this enabling book 
   For a debut album I find Martha Wainwrights work to be Some where in between her more famous Father and Brothers relms of presentations.  This album is a pleasure to listen to and interesting to dwell on the lyrical nuances.  If I had to say whom her work was more influenced by in its nature I would have to give the nod to her father(Loudin Wainwright III).  I personally will purchase her next endevor without previewing any of the tracks.  Hopefully its not 3-4 years before I can hear more of Martha's unique vocal qualities 
 While I believe empiricism is a self-contradictory, hollow theory, at some point one may wish to study it for one reason or another. While not as well represented as it once was, its influence is widespread in philosophy and science (for example, most contemporary economists mistakenly believe that truths are ascertained by well-established empirical laws). Any scholar or student should start here. Ayer's classic book is a (very) lucid and concise exposition of the empiricist thesis, and it defends all its central tenets while attacking rationalist apriorism in just 150 pages or so. In this volume, Ayer's explains the systematic basis of empiricism is the assumption that all knowledge about reality must be verifiable by the five senses - nothing is known a priori about reality and so all knowledge is necessarily hypothetical in nature (as anything known by experience could have been different). All validity-claiming propositions must be empirical or analytic, never both (so a priori true statements are merely true by definition and can never be synthetic. Ethical propositions, because they are neither analytic or empirical, are merely expressions of emotions and have no factual content.  I give empiricism zero stars but this book deserves four in terms of its scholarly value 
 I think this is an excellent product.  Easy to use and clean.  Makes large batches at a time.  I thought the price was great compared to other online stores 
 I loved the movie, I loved the soundtrack. I had several songs on repeat. Then I read the book and found that Charles Frazier had set the town of Cold Mountain right where I was born. One of my favorite songs on the soundtrack was "I'm Going Home". I've tried to research it, to find out who wrote it originally, but I've come up with nothing. If anyone could help me out here, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
 I'm not Indian, but I really love Indian cuisine.  This meal has got quite a kick to it.  It's good in a pinch but if you've got a decent restaurant nearby, it can't compare to takeout.  Do not recommend eating if you've got a buzz, find a safer (milder) alternative 
 This is without a doubt my favorite Christmas CD.  I listen to it over and over again.  Some people might not like it the first time they hear it because Leons voice is different then what many are used to but I guarantee if you give it a chance you will love i 
 My sister used revere ware for years then thought she would try something advertised as "better".That product did not work and now  she is happy I purchased her the Rever ware. We both are happy now! Amazon . com mad it easy to purchase and delivered it before promised time 
 Great album, including the song "I can love you like that." All-4-One Rocks 
 I was extremely pleased with the condition of the book. It was like new 
 With eighteen classic tracks and not a dud in the whole bunch, 'Pure Jazz' lives up to its title.  With such essential numbers as Count Basie's "April in Paris," Glenn Miller's "In the Mood," Sarah Vaughn's version of "Misty," "The Girl from Ipanema," Nat King Cole's "Unforgettable," and Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World," how can even the most casual jazz fan lose?  Also included are nuggets by Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, and Etta James.    Now comes a confession:  This is my first jazz album ever.  I looked for the best one on Amazon I could find, and, after listening to the samples, I was floored.  Now I'm hooked.  George Will said that those who weren't (taken? enthralled?) by jazz's first recordings rendered on the PBS special were "deadwood".  And Tony Bennett said recently that jazz is the only major musical contribution America has made to the world.  Although both are steeped in exaggeration, I at least understand why. 
 well as a long time fan of mr moto series was so happy to find them on amazon and the quality was great  
 I bought this product to tape up the puckering in my button up shirts.  The tape doesn't stay closed all day but it does re-stick when I press it again.  The roll provides a lot of tape so it will last a long time 
 Several new birds appear in this edition; strays and vagrants I may never come across, but appreciate none the less.  The volume was a little premature, as it still lists the Ivory Billed Woodpecker as probably extinct, so the 5th edition will probably soon follow.  I would recommend waiting for the next edition 
 This book was a gift and sat on my shelf for a couple of years because I thought it was going to be a rah rah Irishmen type of thing and usually i want to read those around St Patrick's Day when my blood runs green. But what a wonderful surprise to read a suburb deep intelligent expose of Ireland and Europe as they came together and saved a civilization. Thank you for one of the best reads in a very long time 
 I used these books (Vols. 1&2) in my last two years of high school back in South America. I remember long nights of bad coffee and cigarettes locked in my room reading it over and over. The book is full of really cool knowledge (even for a non-mathematician). Most of today's students learn like little parrots, (without thinking or understanding) just repeating things mindlessly. This will make this book unpopular among these people because having to read a sentence and stop to figure things out on their own is too hard a challenge for them. I guess that like the high standard of the education of old when teachers loved teaching and their subject this book is also going the way of the dinosaurs. I'll get my copy before that if I were you though ;- 
 I heard that this was Krentz's best novel and it was great!  Oliver was such a unique character and he just melted for Annie.  While Annie was a bit outrageous (discussing their sex life problems with ex-boyfriends????), she was the perfect complement to Oliver's coldness.  Krentz leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling after her novels (like Julie Garwood).  You can't miss this one 
 Alejandro Amenabar has only directed four feature films-and yet his reputation as a genuine wunderkind continues to grow. Back in the early 90's-while attending film school in Madrid-he flunked out. He went on to direct a couple terrific short films-which led to his feature film debut-TESIS (1996). He gave us OJOS in 1998 and he emerged as a full-fledged film director, writer, producer, music composer, and sometimes actor-not bad for a lad who flunked out of film school.   Tom Cruise saw OJOS at Sundance, and he bought up the rights for a remake. That project became VANILLA SKY. It is an interesting film-but it pales in comparison to this Spanish original. Amenabar was hired to write the screenplay for SKY-and he went on to direct Nicole Kidman in THE OTHERS for Cruise's production company. Amenabar has been compared to Hitchcock because of the marked creepiness of his first three films. I see influences from Kubrick, Lynch, and Argento as well. He went on to break the mold by directing last year's brilliant THE SEA INSIDE with Javier Bardem.   In ABRE LOS OJOS, it was Amenabar that first turned the film world inside out and created a new film modality-blending the genres of drama, thriller, science fiction, and romance-with a touch of soft-core porn. He took us to new places that later we rediscovered in MATRIX country-places of the mind, of lucid dreaming, of cryogenics and bathos. He used classic themes-that those thin and handsome amongst us would be devastated if their beauty was wrested them. They would prefer oblivion and life within their own cortex-plugged into a super computer.   Eduardo Noriega was brilliant as the young angst-ridden protagonist-Cesar. He portrayed just the right amount of smugness, good looks, arrogance, and conceit. He was not likeable. We could see that he deserved his karmic fate. The role did not fit so comfortably on Tom Cruise. He wanted to be liked-and it weakened the fabric of the plot. Cruise could not dig deep enough within himself to find the real creepiness, the sullen callousness, and then the genuine despair. Penelope Cruz, the "Madonna of Madrid" played Sofia in both films. She was radiant in OJOS. She was pedestrian in SKY. Nude-she was wonderful in each version, of course.   OJOS is a treasure trove of delights and surprises-pain and thrills and passion. It is a colossal achievement from a young filmmaker who seems to be both genius and a maverick. I look forward to his next effort.  
 I found the book to be incredibly powerful.  For me, no other book has opened up the truths of the Bible more.  Silent Killers Of The Faith is dripping with what real freedom in Christ looks like, and goes on to explain how to be truely free from the bondage so many Christians live in today.  Thank you Steve Crosby for having the courage to write about such a controversial issue 
 All of these people saying that the movie is too long or too boring because of the beginning in the bar and the subplots with the schooner and the coast guard helicopter, I believe it was, have no diea what they are talking. This movie is almost a direct make from the book, they had the bar scenes, the stranded schooner ship, and the helicopter disaster. It was all exactly how it was like in the book. If you read the book, then see this movie, and if you saw this movie and thought there was a lot of drown out stuff, go read the book, because it is an exact adaption of the great book 
 Very good ,bu not as good as the other films of Michael Douglas.I dont understand the price.Why full screen is higher price than widescreen 
 I wrote a review of this release earlier, but it seems to have disappeared.  Fortunately, these wonderful films have not.  They've been among my favorites of all time for decades. "Murmur" is probably the best "coming of age" film ever made.  It has everything from philosophical angst in the midst of petty shoplifting to, well, something no other "coming of age" film has.  But despite the controversial nature of that part of the movie, this film was something of a sensation even when it played in the Midwest in the early '70s.  It's funny as hell, but it is also very wise and in the best traditions of French films about life and love, including particularly family life.  It will have you laughing and crying.  I don't think "Lucien" ever made it to VHS.  It's also "coming of age" but in a different way.  It's especially timely in these days of young kids getting caught up in military service that they do not completely understand.   Like "Au Revoir", it's set in the WWII period, whereas "Murmur" is set in the '50s.  "Au Revoir" is another great film with a different "coming of age" theme, like "Murmur" involving friendship and family and like "Lucien", also about choices.  This is one of the most beautiful movies about friendship ever made.  There are several scenes that will have you transfixed, including some, like the Charlie Chaplin excerpts, that are included in extras.  I haven't seen the extras yet, but as soon as I heard about this release, I pre-ordered it.  These are sensational stories and unforgettable characters.  Malle made a lot of films, but these are his best by far, and most of the critics, including the crankiest, agree that they have stood the test of time and are now classics of the cinema.    I waited back in the '80s to get these movies on VHS.  I was pleased to give my VHS copies of "Murmur" and "Au Revoir" to a friend as soon as I got my DVD set.   
 This guy is making millions by selling this very simple advice!  I'm envious that he wrote this book and is selling thousands of copies and I didn't think of doing it first! But, getting my envy under control.....(clears throat).......I think this book informs the reader about  a very good "wealth building" strategy. Of course, there are "pitfalls" to the plan....like the tendency of taking the money out early....but, even so, this plan is better than doing nothing...or buying lottery tickets!  I think the book is worth reading.....   But, perhaps borrow it from a friend so I won't get more jealous of the author than I am at present!  :o)  But, one more thing comes to mind:  In the last chapter the author recommends "tithing".  I suppose he means "tithing" to a church or synagogue or mosque or to some other charitable organization.  He says at one point:  "When you tithe you will recieve wealth back.  I have seen this happen."....or words to that effect. I DISAGREE STRONGLY--especially for people making $10 an hour or in that vacinity!  In the start of the book the author talks about "the latte effect" and he pursuades all of us that we CAN save without hurting our lifestyle hardly at all.  Thus we give up Starbucks and other "luxuries" and that money goes into SAVINGS.  Then at the end, he recommends us to SPEND that money we just saved by giving up "latte" and he recommends that we spend that money for "tithing"---giving the money away to someone else!  That would be fine if your wage is, say, $50 an hour---tithe all you want!  But, I assume this book is also geared to the wage earner who makes $10 an hour.  At $10 an hour with todays prices for food, gas, lodging no one will be able to save a dime if they give 10% away as a gift!  And, the idea that "if you give you will receive back" is so false because THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU GIVE AWAY AND WHAT YOU RECEIVE.  The "connection" is actually between "how much you benefit your fellow mankind and what you receive".  For example,  Bill Gates is wealthy..why?  Because he gives money away? No,  he is wealthy because he "benefits his fellow human beings" with his software that we all need and use.  Thus, when someone says, "Give money to my cause or organization and you will 'position yourself to receive'" that person is not telling the truth?  The truth is that if you BENEFIT your fellow man, then you will receive.  Thus, is it true that  there a connection between giving money to a church and later as a result receiving wealth back? I don't believe so.  BUT I KNOW there IS a connection between benefitting mankind and receiving money back.  So, I suggest the $10 an hour employee give, say,  $10 a week to the minister of their church if that makes them feel good and they want to help the minister.  But, forget about "tithing" to "receive back"...and  use that "latte or tithing money" for savings for YOUR retirement and/or the investment in a college education for YOUR kids.  Otherwise, you might find out that that personable and friendly minister used your "tithes" for HIS retirement and/or for the education of HIS kids!  Email:boland7214@aol 
 If you enjoy relational fiction, this book will keep you turning pages.  As you proceed through the story, Nicholas Sparks provides additional details of the conditions that exist between the parties involved.  Slowly unwinding the circumstances of why The Notebook was being read and pulling the reader into the love story as it developed through the years.

 In her fifth and what was to be her final installment in the novels about Tom Ripley, RIPLEY UNDER WATER, Patricia Highsmith has written a suspenseful page-turner that both shocks and entertains the reader. The talented Mr. Ripley, married to Heloise, now lives in France. He is the perfect friendly neighbor-- although he of course must maintain his distance from others as he is the killer of four people, Dickie Greenleaf, Murchison and two Mafia members. But Tom is no longer completely convinced that he committed all these murders. "Some remembered experiences faded, he [Tom] supposed, such as that of killing. . ." until a strange American Pritchard and his wife show up at the most inappropriate times and disrupt Mr. Ripley's placid existence.  Ripley now takes harpischord lessons, listens to Brahms waltzes, drinks gin and tonics and kirs, grows dahlias, watches videos of "Some Like It Hot," and reads Richard Ellman's biography of Oscar Wilde. He is quite the gentleman of leisure. He is also a cold-blooded killer. This writer has the amazing ability to make you root for this psychopath although you know that he possesses few if any redeeming qualities. On the other hand, it's no coincidence that the Iagos of the world are much more fascinating then the Cordelias.  The story stops rather abruptly; Ms. Highsmith apparently meant to write another chapter to Mr. Ripley's life. Unfortunately that did not happen. Nevertheless, this novel is entertainment at its best. 
 Simon Winchester, trained as a geologist, is a bit fascinated with catastrophes.  He has written about the eruption of Krakatoa (Krakatoa) and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 (A Crack In the Edge of the World) along with many other books on diverse subjects (The Professor and the Madman, for instance, which describes one of the more intriguing contributors to the Oxford English Dictionary).  But The Map That Changed the World must, for him, have been a special endeavor as William Smith the creator of the map is especially revered by the English and resides, along with Hutton and Lyell in their geological pantheon, which is obviously crowded.  The map, the first truly geological map, covers most of the British Isles and looks remarkably similar to current U.S. geological maps, especially in the use of myriad colors to indicate different formations.   (The word "geology" was first used in its modern sense in 1735.)  Today, the eight foot by six map hangs behind blue curtains in Burlington House on the north side of Piccadilly.  	The map Smith created "...was conceived, imagined, begun, undertaken, and continued and completed [in 1815] against all odds by just one man."  It was drawn when many in Britain still were convinced that James Ussher's assertion that the earth was created at 9 A.M. on October 23, 4004 B.C was true.  It is even more remarkable because Smith lived a wretched life.  He was a simple, self-taught, country man with a very sick wife who went bankrupt and became homeless shortly after he finished the map.  But both the industrial and agrarian revolutions were at hand.  Smith's initial interest was sparked by the sea-urchin shaped stone used as a "pound" stone on English scales.  He was hired as a surveyor's helper working in the coal mines in Somerset.  Every time he went down he looked at what we would now call the stratigraphic column.  "The pattern, Smith saw, was always the same, in mine after mine after mine: from top to bottom, Sandstone, Siltstone, Mudstone, Nonmarine Band, Marine Band, coal, Seat Earth, and then again Sandstone, Siltstone, Mudstone, on and on."  He wondered whether there might not be a way of predicting what lay where and, indeed, a way of drawing a guide to what lay below.  And because, in part, that he wondered about this he was selected to be the surveyor for the Somerset Canal, which, in effect, opened the earth to him.  	Once opened, he started comparing the facies at different places.  He investigated two that were identical for all practical purposes, except that they had been deposited at different elevations, as much as hundreds of feet.  The color, chemistry and grain size was identical, but the fossils were different:  "Every single one of the specimens of one kind of fossil might be the same throughout one bed, but would be subtly different from those of the same kind of fossil found in another bed."  The map followed.  Smith saw a soil map in the County Agricultural Report showing"... the geographical extent of each of the various soils and types of vegetation that were known in the countryside around Bath.  His first map and the oldest of true geological maps depicted the geology around Bath, published in 1799.  He drew and dictated the stratigraphic column that was the basis of the map at a dinner with friends.  That drawing is preserved by the Geological Society of London today.  However, shortly thereafter, Smith was fired by the canal company for unknown reasons, found himself with too big of a mortgage and eventually ended up in debtor's prison.  Winchester describes the English legal system in as great detail as he does the making of Smiths map.  The details of the map and the friends who helped Smith with it are captivating and represent a great deal of scholarship and digging.  Smith got it done, but his debts were not paid and so he ended up in jail.  Upon his release he found employment with a William Fitton who eventually realized that he was the Smith who had prepared the map, which had become very well known although controversial.  Eventually, Smith was recognized for the map he had prepared.  If Winchester has left out any historical geologist of note in telling the heroic, tragic and then heroic again events of Smith's life, it is not readily apparent.  Winchester is a felicitous writer who has told the life of one of the more interesting members of England's scientific community along with the side notes that reinforces the opprobrium that "there will always be an England." 	 
 AFI makes really good music. I wish there wasn't as much screamo but besides that I love them 
 It is after the events told in the HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy. Lyra Belacqua (now Lyra Silvertongue) is back in the Oxford of her world -- the one with Jordan College and a zeppelin station and personal daemons.   While relaxing on the roof of Jordan College she espies a large flock of birds aggressively pursuing a lone bird who appears to be a witch's daemon. (You may recall that witches' daemons could be separated from their people and perform errands many thousands of miles away.) Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon manage to draw the bird into the building and protect it.   The bird is on an errand from the witch Yelena Pazhets who is seaking a local alchemist named Sebastian Makepeace. Lyra and Pantalaimon locate the alchemist, upon which there is a surprise ending which I will not reveal. And there is an interesting lesson that Lyra learns from her experience.  LYRA'S OXFORD is essentially a short story that will take only an hour to devour. The book contains a foldout map of Lyra's Oxford, plus a postcard from Mary Malone (the scientist introduced in THE SUBTLE KNIFE) and 1930-ish ads for cruises to various ports. The map and illustrations are nicely drawn, but do not contribute materially to one's enjoyment of the story.  One gets the feeling that LYRA'S OXFORD consists of materials that Pullman didn't quite know at the time how to integrate into a larger structure. Not to worry, however, because the book is fun anyhow. If some day Pullman gets the full Tolkien treatment, there will be less expensive editions incorporating other short stories, but let's hope that doesn't happen for a long time. I want to see Pullman live for many more productive years. After all, I am addicted to his stories.  
 I wasn't sure at first about getting this CD because I had read reviews of it saying it was cheesy pop and it was too manufactured, and it was suffering a case of 'too many cooks spoiling the broth', etc.  But those reviews, in my opinion, were so wrong!   My favorite tracks are: Radio All In A Day Give Me A Reason Rain No More Cry Somebody for Someone  Sure, this album is totally pop, but it's GOOD pop. The Corrs did a great job at giving their traditional Irish sound a great studio treatment.   If you liked their first hit single from this album, 'Breathless', that's a good indicator of what you'll hear in this album.  Initially I thought the version of 'Radio' on this album was a little funny - that the drum beats didn't match the original intent of the song, after hearing them sing it on 'The Corrs Unplugged' (an acoustic version, which sounds gorgeous). But now I love both versions.  'No More Cry' stands out immediately because it is easily one of the catchiest tracks on this album. I was a little turned off at first because of the funny grammar in the lyrics. But this somg is truly one of those you can listen to anytime, anywhere, and it will still sound great. At a duration of 2:59, it won't wear you out either.  'All In A Day' is another of my favorites on this disc because the song is so perfect. It starts out great, it develops in a very beautiful way, and it ends in a very haunting way that will get stuck in your head. The harmony at the end of this song is probably the most 'Celtic-like' moment in the album.  'Rain', 'All the Love in the World' and 'Somebody for Someone' are perfect for rainy, moody days. I love these songs.  Of course, like many albums out there, there are songs that just didn't work. 'Hurt Before', 'Rebel Heart', and 'One Night' are some of those songs. 'One Night' and 'Hurt Before' are really boring, and The Corrs are WAY better at doing instrumentals than something like 'Rebel Heart'. Check out 'Silver Strand' on their album 'Borrowed Heaven', or any of those in their first CD, 'Forgiven, Not Forgotten'.  Besides that, this album is a wonderful addition to your music collection, and I think this is what pop is all about! This is a good album to start off with if you're new to the Corrs as well, and if you like pop 
      During a visit to the island of Kaua'i last summer a local told me about "Bruddah Iz".  I was told that he was much loved by the people of Hawai'i.  I had to know more.  After returning to the mainland I went to Amazon.com and ordered "Facing Future".        This man's voice has been discribed as that of an angel.  I found it to be strong and tender. His music, an impassionated ode to the land and people he loved.      This CD is a "must have" for those who love Hawai'i, as I do.

 _Cosmic Consciousness:  A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind_, first published in 1901 and republished by Arkana books, by Richard Maurice Bucke, M.D., is a classic investigation of the development of man's mystic relation to the infinite.  Richard Maurice Bucke was a Canadian psychiatrist (or "alienist") who served as the head of an asylum for the insane.  Bucke had little formal education and during his youth had traveled to the West where he lost a foot due to frostbite.  Bucke became a doctor of medicine after putting himself through medical school and won many awards as a psychiatrist.  After hearing of the poetry of Walt Whitman (particularly his "Leaves of Grass"), Bucke underwent a profound change and devoted much of his time to mystical matters.  His first book was dedicated to Whitman, and Whitman plays a unique role in this book as well.  In 1872, Bucke experienced an Illumination (which he took to be glimmerings of "cosmic consciousness") which led him further into his researches into mysticism.  Furthermore, Bucke was long fascinated by the question of the authorship of the works of Shakespeare and long maintained that Francis Bacon was the real author of the Shakespeare plays and poems.  This book came to have an important influence on later generations of mystical writers, including the Russian mathematician and philosopher P. D. Ouspensky, the American psychologist and philosopher William James, and the British writer on mysticism Evelyn Underhill.  Throughout this book, Bucke maintains that a new form of consciousness is developing in man (that of "cosmic consciousness"), that this form of consciousness is as different from man's normal consciousness as "self consciousness" is from "simple consciousness", and that this development is part of an evolutionary process (Bucke bases much of his theory on the writings of Charles Darwin).  This book begins with a dedication to Richard Maurice Bucke from his father, following the death of his son.  Following this a brief introduction to "The Man and the Book" by George Moreby Acklom appears.  The first section of this book is entitled "First Words" and is dedicated to expounding Bucke's theory of cosmic consciousness.  Bucke writes, "Cosmic Consciousness, then, is a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man."  Bucke distinguishes between what he terms "simple consciousness" (possessed by the upper half of the animal kingdom; consciousness of oneself, one's body, and thing's around oneself), "self consciousness" (the consciousness in man in which one becomes aware of oneself as a distinct entity from all the rest of the universe), and "cosmic consciousness" (a consciousness of the cosmos accompanied by feelings of illumination, joyfulness, elevation, and moral exaltation).  Bucke contends that this new form of consciousness is developing in man, just as self consciousness developed out of simple consciousness through the process of evolution.  Bucke goes on to explain various instances of cosmic consciousness, accompanying processes, and relates it to God, Christ, Nirvana, and Brahmanic splendour.  The second section of this book is entitled "Evolution and Devolution".  Here, Bucke traces the development from simple consciousness to self consciousness (as animals progressed to man).  Bucke makes several interesting observations, including particularly noting that the ancients apparently had fewer words for colors than modern man does (perhaps indicating an evolutionary development in color consciousness).  Bucke also provides a chart showing the development of the levels of consciousness (and their apparent proportion of occurrence in the general population).  Bucke also mentions the idea of "devolution" (noting the prevalence of insanity and "idiocy" as instances of this).  The third section of this book is entitled "From Self Consciousness to Cosmic Consciousness".  Here, Bucke notes the various accompanying phenomena of cosmic consciousness (including that of moral elevation), the rarity of cosmic consciousness, the fact that instances of it are apparently increasing (since the beginning of recorded history), the fact that it is more likely to occur in men than women, and the fact that it tends to occur at the age of full maturity.  The fourth section of this book is entitled "Instances of Cosmic Consciousness".  Bucke maintains that the following individuals experienced definite instances of cosmic consciousness (and uses the increasing frequency of such cases to argue for his evolutionary theory):  Gautama the Buddha (called "Nirvana"), Jesus the Christ (Bucke maintains that Jesus was a man; called "the Kingdom of God"), Paul (called "Christ"), Plotinus, Mohammed, Dante (called "Beatrice"), Bartolome Las Casas, John Yepes (Saint John of the Cross), Francis Bacon (Bucke maintains that Bacon was the real author of Shakespeare's plays and poems and quotes extensively from them to "prove" this), Jacob Behmen (the Teutonic Theosopher), William Blake, Honore de Balzac, Walt Whitman (Bucke quotes extensively from his "Leaves of Grass" believing Whitman to be among the highest levels of cosmic consciousness so far produced in man), and Edward Carpenter.  The fifth section of this book is entitled "Additional - Some of Them Lesser, Imperfect And Doubtful Cases" and details some additional cases of cosmic consciousness, though of a lesser or more doubtful degree.  Bucke mentions here various authors, poets, writers, and prophets known to him as well as a few cases from individuals that he personally met or corresponded with.  The sixth section of this book is entitled "Last Words".  Here, Bucke expounds upon some other instances of cosmic consciouness, again details his evolutionary theory, and explains why it is necessary for the individual so illuminated to be of the right mental and physical physique.  In this book, Bucke provides a unique study of the mystical phenomenon and its apparent increase among members of the human race.  As with many scientists from the Victorian era, Bucke was perhaps too wedded to the ideas behind evolutionary theory and the notion of progress.  Indeed, Bucke maintains that with the coming development of cosmic consciousness a new social order will be made possible, echoing many of the socialist theories popular at the time.  Nevertheless, this book played a very important role in furthering our understanding of mysticism, our sense of the cosmos, and the attempt to study it using scientific methods.  Bucke's work would be carried on by later thinkers and researchers who were to reference repeatedly in their own studies of mysticism. 
 If you truly want to understand American culture this book is essential.  It's erudite, detailed, patient, yet lively, examination of the themes of early American life and literature are revelatory.  I have no doubt it will become a "classic" of American scholarship 
 These were perfect, the girl liked them, they're the perfect size, not very expensive, great gift 
 I was very pleasantly surprised with how well this book performed at 2 very different levels. It provided a very simple introduction to Real Time programming (with a definite focus on the ThreadX OS) as well as being a very useful reference for an experienced ThreadX user.  I have been using ThreadX for several years (although not on the ARM processor) and I wanted the book to help with training some new programmers as well as to evaluate the option of using the ARM on a new project. I was impressed as to how well the book helped to achieve these goals.  The book gives a clear explanation on how the various Operating System services are used and where they are appropriate. The demonstration version of ThreadX was very useful for playing with the concepts and getting a "hands on" feel for how things worked without having to deal with all the details of how to get a program running on an embedded system.  I also liked the description of how the system is implemented on the ARM processor, it gave enough detail that I could understand the interaction with the hardware and made it much simpler to introduce a non-ARM architecture as part of the training.   As useful as the book was for the introduction and training aspect, I have noticed that it has also become my standard ThreadX reference at work, which was not what I expected. While the ThreadX documentation does have more detail I have found it much simpler to use this book and I have only needed to refer to the "official" documentation once or twice since I got this book. I have also found the demonstration OS very useful for prototyping and testing.  The only group that I think may not find this book as useful a reference, is the knowledgable embedded developer who is not working with ThreadX and wants to find out more about the OS or about the ARM processor. For this audience there is probably insufficient depth and more detail than they require, but for anyone who is entering the field or is working with ThreadX regularly I would highly reccomend this book 
 The university I teach for uses this book.  It is an "easy to complex" book which is perfect for the classroom or for the manager who wants to improve his or her strategic management skills in the comfort of their reading room.  The strategic management model developed by the authors is easy to follow--and remember--to include the many connections it makes with external and internal analysis.  I am most impressed with the authors' coverage of leadership, organizational structure, and culture.  Not only will you learn the basics of strategic management--but it is a quick read and includes some outstanding case study's to reenforce the learning.  A great read 
 While I wholly appreciated this book for the story in of its self, I was not a fan of how far away it strayed from the story of Mr Darcy and Miss Bennett.  This really could have been completely taken out of the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman series all together.  It was more of a historical mystery novel than an addition to the story of Pride & Prejudice in my opinion.  Marketing it as such would have been a better idea.  The story itself was good, just not to the inclusion of an addition to Jane Austen's original work 
 By far, "The Notebook" is my favorite book of Nicholas Sparks ("Dear John" being a close second). Sparks is always able to make the reader feel those intense emotions of true love. If you are looking for a mindless read that makes you leave it all behind and get engrossed in the moment, then "The Notebook" is the best.  If you enjoy Nicholas Sparks books, I highly recommend "The Time Keeper" by Kevin E. Cropp. Both writers have that ability to take you into their world and not let you go 
 In Reality, author Peter Kingsley addresses the necessity of discerning what is "real" in the chaos and uncertainty that afflict the contemporary lives of ordinary men and women. Reality presents the story of Parmendides and Empedocles (ancient masters of wisdom who laid the foundation for our present Western culture some 2500 years ago) revealing how their teachings had been distorted, suppressed, and forgotten -- until now. Kingsley's text is direct and accessible as he guides the reader gently but deeply into a body of remarkable teachers which addresses everything from healing to cosmology -- while expanding an awareness of what is real and timeless in human life. Reality is a unique and enthusiastically recommended contribution to Metaphysical Studies collections and a welcome addition to supplementary Philosophy reading lists as well 
 Trapped in a job that he despises, Ned Cholurski just wants to go home to his roommate and best friend, Fiona. Only she can make him feel better. Best friends since high school, Ned cherishes their friendship because he knows that Fiona could have any man that she wants and everyday he can't believe that she wants to be friends with him, the school nerd.   Fiona is tired of being ignored. Trying to get a clerk job in a lawyer's office, she comes up with a plan. Ned is tried of being pushed over at work and she is tired of not getting a foot in the door. So, the only thing left for them to do is to pretend to date each other. That way Ned will be the office stud, and his boss in turn will notice him. Once the boss notices Ned, Fiona knows that it is just a matter of time before he writes her a letter of recommendation to his golf buddy's law firm. Now all she has to do is convince Ned that this plan will work.   That's What Friends Are For is just an all around cute book. It made me laugh and Ned's humor made me roll my eyes. Whoever says that friends can't be lovers did not read this book. While my ideal man is not a computer "geek", Ned comes across as being extremely sexy in a humorous sort of way. Fiona, on the other hand, is not your average head cheerleader. Smart, sassy, and funny, she compliments Ned completely. Bridget Midway has a winner with That's What Friends Are For. Having previously only read one book from Ms. Midway, I hoped that this book would be just as good as the first one I read. I was not disappointed!   Talia Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewe 
 A Break With Charity is one of the best books I have ever read! Even though it is fiction, it still talks about history. Most people still thinks there are real events about the Salem Witch Trials. This book interested me a lot and I hope people will have the chance to read it. I saw this book on Opera and I wanted to read it because everyone else was reading it and it actually was a great book. I haven't read Rinaldi's other books but now I think I will 
 Season 3 of this show is even better than the first two seasons. This is a show about a community -- the kids, the parents, and how everyone interact. The actors playing the various people in this show do a great job of making you either love them or hate them, and that is the mark of good acting.  This is an addictive show that really plays on your emotions. It's not some overly dramatic soap-opera, but it's not a bubble-gum weekly like 90210 either. It's just the right amount of drama stirred up with a healthy dose of emotional impact.  I genuinely recommend this show to anyone who enjoys beautiful people in dramatic situations, and this disc set comes with some fun bonus features as well:  The Bonus Features are  * Making of The Subways music video * What's In a Name? * From Script to Screen - The Party Favor * Gag Reel * Pass The Remote - Scene surfing commentar 
 I have a start up drapery workroom business in my home.  This book gave me just what I was looking for: priciples as well as practicle guidelines 
 It is so difficult to do justice to a book about great speeches. By definition, the content should be good - even great, which is partly why this book is such a rich treasure. The other reason why Lend Me Your Ears is such a useful resource is the commentary provided by editor William Safire.   Safire opens the book with "An Introductory Address." It is a witty treatise on the elements of a great speech. The ten steps (plus a "secret eleventh")he outlines are not original, but in total provide very good guidelines for the budding speechwriter.  Safire then provides context and a brief critique for each of the speeches referenced. These speeches range from ancient Greece to today. Some of them are not great speeches, some are not by nice people, but in their own way the speeches were effective - sometimes horribly so e.g. Adolph Hitler, Lenin, Stalin.  His commentary on Hitler for instance explains very simply and lucidly why this "curse of Hitler," in Winston Churchill's words, became so compelling to many Germans. "Hitler's speeches often lacked the strength of coherence, but with slashing racism and the powerful imagery of nationalism, he was able to delight and control crowds resentful of the reminders of past defeats."  I'm not sure if the reader will ever get to all the speeches in the book, but it is a great shelf item, to pick up at will, browse, imagine you were there when Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, when Lou Gehrig bids farewell to baseball (in a beautiful short address)and when Senator Everett Dirksen extols the virtue of the Marigold. I kid you not.  Two gems I really appreciated and are little nuggets. Branch Rickey discovers the quality that makes a baseball player great (Ty Cobb), and Richard Nixon's eulogy for Senator Dirksen, which Safire admits he was partly responsible for.  For the keen student of communication and speech, this book is a treasure. 
 We watched this movie together at the last Thanksgiving dinner with our Grandfather and we all loved this movie.  It is etched into our family memories. Great movie to share with your family and loved ones. Highly recommended 
 Jack and Jamie are back, thank goodness, and in this latest offering from Lee Charles Kelley they take readers on another fun ride with, of course, all of their canine companions. While this book can certainly be read as a stand alone, readers would be well-served to grab up all the prior Jack and Jamie books first, because they're fun to read, and second, to get to know the characters. I don't think anyone that enjoys this genre would be disappointed. And speaking of which, what a breath of fresh air Mr. Kelley brings to the world of dog mysteries! I devour books; they are my preferred form of entertainment and relaxation. When I want a fun read, I choose a dog mystery. Quite honestly, it seemed the field had rather dried up recently. Even one of the authors I read regularly abandoned us and wrote about....ee gads...cats! Enter Mr. Kelley.   As with his prior books, in "Twas The Bite Before Christmas", Mr. Kelley gives us a fun mystery with two main protagonists that you will like immediately; well, if, like me, you like a smart-aleck know-it-all pain in the butt guy like Jack ( but hey, he loves dogs, has a great sense of justice, does volunteer work for sick children, and beats up tough mafia hoods,and doesn't give up till he solves the crime...what's not to like? ),and Jamie, well, everyone loves Jamie. ( Even if Mr. Kelley does attribute her occasional moodiness to certain 28 day cycles....what's Jack's excuse?? )But you get the drift; these two have fun together, even through ups and downs, and the reader has fun right along with them. The quirky supporting cast is a bit out there, but somehow Mr. Kelley brings it all together and makes it work. After all, it is supposed to be a fun read, and from the rich,eccentric,devious Brights whose housemaid is found murdered at the beginning of the book, to their mafia connected chauffeur Karl, to their mysterious visiting "professor", to tales of elves and strange lights in the Bright mansion, and most importantly, to the dogs that Mr. Kelley cleverly weaves into his stories, it IS a fun read, and it works.  One last note from someone who is an absolutely committed, passionate, nutso, over the top, fanatical dog lover. Most people that enjoy this genre are dog people. I would venture a guess that readers would be happy to see their breed represented in a book they're reading. Until now, there wasn't much chance of that happening. Most dog mystery writers write from their limited experiences and stick to the breed they know. Mr. Kelley is a trainer and has vast experience with many breeds; he also obviously knows that readers will want to see their breed(s) represented in his books. This is not just a smart marketing idea; it makes for more interesting reading. Mr. Kelley also finds ways of smoothly educating readers on his training philosophies and methods. As someone who trains dogs, I love this. I have gone from thinking "interesting", to "YES!!" to bookmarking Mr. Kelley's web site. THIS trainer is always open to learning how to do things a better way. In closing, although I primarily read for entertainment, yes, I have always most enjoyed books from which I can learn something. I never expected to learn anything from a dog mystery. Thank you, Mr. Kelley. Silvija Vecrumb 
 This is the 5th edition of this almost thousand page book (992), and has been pretty much the gold standard for JavaScript reference books.  I have the 4th edition that came out a few years ago and it was worth upgrading to this new 5th edition.  JavaScript use has changed a lot the past few years and this new edition definitely focuses on the changes that have been following JavaScript with Ajax and DOM implementations.  The book is totally updated for updated browser support (IE6, Firefox, Opera and Safari) and details any specific browser quirks as well. This book will replace your hours of surfing online for JavaScript sites looking for that one obscure thing that you can't find in your other books. I also like it because it is easy to find things with its divided sections into: Core JavaScript, Client-Side JavaScript, Core JavaScript Reference, and Client-Side JavaScript Reference.   I really can say that this book does not leave anything out. Though I'm not a JavaScript guru (yet), but this book is as complete as you'll find (even comparing it to the Bible books).  This should not be your first JavaScript book, unless you have some programming background because it can be a little daunting going through everything because it is so detailed. If you do any real JavaScript programming or development (or will be doing some in the future), this definitely has to be in your bookshelf. 
 None So Blind provides a personal account of the intelligence failure in Vietnam by an ex-CIA intelligence official who documents who intelligence appraisals of the situation were either ignored or rejected by policymakers because they failed to support common assumptions of the government. A fascinating examination of these assumptions, None So Blind goes beyond most Vietnam guides to probe the sources of underlying failures 
 How can one write a review of The Story of San Michele that comes close to doing justice to the book?  There are many humorous episodes, such as The Giant and Mamsell Agata, touches of the macabre in the description of the cholera epidemic in Naples, misadventures, like the journey to Sweden accompanying a young man (then his corpse).  There are also angry moments, as when his dog Tom is brutally kicked by the slimy Vicomte Maurice.  Who could not be moved by the story of the boy John, who was rescued by Munthe but never lived long enough to find a loving home.  It is a book that includes many memorable events in a life that was very full indeed.  Many of the chapters in this book could be made into marvelous films, given the right adaptation.  The Story of San Michele is very well written, to say the least, and the many people, events and personal feelings of the author combine to make this a special adventure.  Perhaps most special of all is Axel Munthe's relationship to animals that allowed him to get close, even to "wild" animals and have a special relationship with them.  He was a man who held nature and all life in special regard but was pragmatic in the face of illness and death.     I have had a copy since 1988 and I have given Axel Munthe's book as a gift and been thanked for the introduction.  I could not recommend this book highly enough.      
 Dr. King, as we all know, was a man of intelligence, persistence, devotion, and respect, and this book inspires all of those qualities in each of us. I have purchased this book for family members, and they have received its message with the same delight that I did. I highly suggest reading this or buying as a gift for a friend in need of a little inspiration

 This book was one of the most addicting page-turners I have yet to pick up. It's lesson on life is adamant throughout the book, and seems to be an urgent message from the author. Wonderful story...a must read.. 
 David A. Price has written a compact, fascinating tale that focuses tightly on John Smith, Pocohontas and the first two decades of the Virginia colony in Love and Hate in Jamestown.  The author manages to include much recent scholarship while keeping the narrative quite accesible.  It is not the wonderful romp that Big Chief Elizabeth by Giles Milton is as its perspective is not as large and the writing not quite as juicy.  Still, the tale told by Price is an important one and a he tells it well as he makes a strong case for the veracity of John Smith's account of events and Smith's influence on the future of the country that would become America.  Jamestown is always an interesting story and this book does not fail it 
 There are so many BAD karaoke CDs out there, this is not one of them.  Sybersound does an absolutely awesome job with all of their karaoke CDs.  I already own 10 of their karaoke CD's and am happy to say that I've yet to find a song that is even remotely flubbed up.  It's not a multiplex, so you won't get any help from vocalists, though, they added some wonderful REAL sounding background vocals for the chorus (when required.)  Also, because it's not multiplex, you get more songs for your money 
 Any At The Gates fan would already own this cd, but if you don't, you need to. For any Swedish metal aficionados, this is similar to Entombed's Uprising album. Very raw and raucous. I find it right up my particularly dark and forboding alley. All three albums from The Haunted are worthy of attention, yet this one stands out as my personal favorite.   Be warned, newcomers to the metal world, any comparisons between this band and others such as In Flames or Dark Tranquility are ill-deserved. While I am a big fan of those bands, this band is far more abrasive and flat out rockin. 
 This movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out.  An excellent and energetic movie from the start. Plot is cutesy.  It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences.  However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes?  I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me.  If memory serves me, didn't Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away?  Isn't there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex's (girl)friend whom the latter was dating?  Wasn't there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss?  If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version.  I find this version incomplete somehow.  But Jennifer Beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn't star in more movies for her generation 
 well lets see i was at the video store a couple years ago and came across this movie since then i been hooked this is a very good movie good actors to bad shannon presby career didint go further its so 80s gotta love it kinda long but very good funny part when gideon urinated on loren abbys brother just so much to say but hay its a very good movie to own if you can get it should be put back in production lori loughlon good for the time john philbon is decent the rest of the crew fit their role 
 If you are like me and love almost all things television, this is an interesting look at what it takes to get shows on the screen and how networks battle for a particular show.  Once you can get behind the long title, you'll learn so much that you probably didn't know before. Apparently, Desperate Housewives was passed by NBC, CBS etc until finally someone at ABC gave it a go and look at what happend.  Nobody at NBC or CBS would give Mark Cherry a go because he didn't have a reputation anymore.   He talks about how the people who 'green light' Lost, Grey's Anatomy were on their way out the door and almost fired when they stumbled across these now hits.  How Friends' producers never wanted the show to be set around a coffee shop.  They wanted them to be around a diner.  How Jeff Zucker founded a show's supersizing. This is a great eye-opening look at the behind the scenes moves that go on all the time that we are mostly unaware of.  I really loved it and though it's a bit heavy at times, it's mostly really enjoyable and fun. 
 Having read just about everything on the Plath/Hughes partnership I have to say that Diane Middlebrook's book is simply the best in the lucid intelligence and even-handedness with which she tackles a subject which has hitherto excited a great deal of sensationalistic biography and shallow "analysis" . Her understanding of both poets' work and placement within the culture is a tour de force. I can't praise it highly enough 
 Even though you do not have any basic knowledge of finance, you can understand it easily by reading this book.  I used it for my MBA program in Financial Management course.  There is no case study included but exercises at the end of each chapter can make you understand its context better.  I recommend anyone taking a finance class to use this book.  You will like it 
 Daddy, by Danielle Steel is a wonderful book or love, hope, and happiness. This book is a change from the domestic cliches you're used to hearing about. Sarah and Oliver Watson were married for twenty five years, but one day out of the blue Sarah decided to go back to college, and take writing classes. Going back to Harvard meant leaving her husband, and three kids to run the house by themselves. Will she ever come back? The kids were distraught, their lives torn apart. Will they ever return to normal? In this enjoyable story, Ms. Steel will make you laugh, cry,and even fall in love. She impresses the reader with complex, and curious plotlines, but pleasantly simple writing style. Daddy, is an excellent choice, if you want a great book to read over the summer.f 
 Undine Spragg, the highest-maintenance of Edith Wharton's heroines, is so neurotically obsessed with climbing the social ladder that even when she is at the very top she is dissatisfied because she can see still another rung she would like to attain.  Money is not her sole objective; there are less tangible rewards like prestige, flattery, her name mentioned with admiration in the society pages and in dinner conversations, and possibly--but not necessarily--love, of which she, like Madame Bovary, seems incapable.  "The Custom of the Country" is not Wharton's version of Flaubert's novel, though; it is the curious and intricate psychological construction of a woman with a bizarre addiction that only worsens as her situation improves.      We first meet Undine as a young woman in New York, where she is living with her parents in a swank hotel suite in the upper West Side.  Her father is an entrepreneur who has earned a small fortune in the Spraggs' Midwestern hometown of Apex City and has decided to move his family to New York so that his daughter may enter high society, which, as it turns out, is guarded by an almost impenetrable barrier of snobbery.  However, with the help of a high-class manicurist named Mrs. Heeny and her own beauty and charm, Undine is able to make the acquaintance of some of the city's most fashionable families.  Thus Undine embarks on a twisted odyssey through the jungles of high society, first marrying a young man named Ralph Marvell, scion of a prominent New York family.  Ralph is a nice guy but too much the romantic and not quite rich enough to entertain her in the way she demands, and so he is forced to put aside his dream of becoming a writer and take a lifeless job in a real estate firm to support her.  Like the mischievously seductive water nymph that is her mythical namesake, Undine draws her adoring poet into a bittersweet affair that ultimately destroys him while she proceeds to other men with greater promise--the ugly but wealthy Peter Van Degen, the gallant French count Raymond de Chelles, the shady schemer Elmer Moffatt.  Like a portraitist who uses exterior details to help define the character of her subject, Wharton is keenly aware of the little things in society that create the big picture.  Undine, for example, feels entitled to everything she wants and stands up to her men (whether her father or a husband) with the indignant assertiveness of a spoiled child.  It is of no concern to her that de Chelles rebukes her for her American indifference to the European sentimental value of heirlooms when she tries to sell his tapestries, or that her neglected son Paul, oblivious to his mother's machinations, has developed no traditional familial ties and is continually moving to homes, opulent though they are, belonging to new stepfathers he barely knows.    The novel's title refers to one character's theory about a man's duty to work hard for his woman without telling her anything about his work--the implication being that, in 1913 in the type of society Wharton knew, a woman was expected to rely on her husband for all her income and not to ask questions or have an opinion about how he made the money.  A single woman would have to depend on an allowance from living relatives or an inheritance from dead ones or (worst of all) have to take a job as a governess or something even more menial.  The most pressing theme of "The House of Mirth" (1905) is that there is nothing worse than being a society woman without money; "The Custom of the Country" observes what a society woman must do to ensure that she never finds herself in such a situation.    
  I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AND FOUR OTHER BOOKS ( ALL BABY NAME BOOKS) IN DIFFERENT CULTURES. I AM HALF GERMAN AND HALF ITALIAN WHILE MY HUSBAND IS HUNGARIAN AND IRISH. THIS BOOK IS GOOD FOR PARENTS WHO WAIT TO THE LAST MOMMENT AT THER HOSPITAL TO PICK THE BABYS NAME 
 The Canon EF 75-300mm is a Excellent product, I own the expensive USM version and this lense doesn't have nothing to be jealous about it, it's speed to focus is excellent,the main reason i bougth it is for my wildlife photography while kayaking, I wouln't take the USM version on my kayak, to expensive to get it wet, they both perform excellent, but the cheap price of this lense make it affordable and risk proof for your pocket, it's a little noisy but nothing that will affect it's use, plus it is a intimidating peace of equipment, that will make any person think you are a professional photographe 
 I have heard a lot about "The Automatic Diet."  Actually, "a lot" can be quantified into hours of praise from one of my best friends.  She really liked the book and her slender figure attests to the book's methods.    My friend has been on many fad diets in the past.  She had done juice diets, the Atkins diet and has feverishly hit gym.  The problem has been that she has not been able to maintain the weight loss.  She has roller-coastered physically and emotionally.  "The Automatic Diet" has curbed this sporadic behavior and has provided weight loss with a program that should be easy to maintain.  
 Travolta rarely picks a bad script so it was shocking to see him in the deliciously overwrought, delightfully insipid military thriller.  Johnny T. does carry this film though. He carries it to the edge of boredom and then tosses it off some sort of Looney Tunes cliff till it plummets at such a precipitous pace that upon impact it's liquefied. When I saw this in the theatre, it was playing next to the Matrix and I could hear the heavy metal music coming through the walls. Hearing that music was the highlight of seeing The General's Daughter. That, and I snuck in a whole bag of "fun size" peanut butter cups. I can only imagine when the usher went to my aisle and saw all the golden foil wrappers.   What must he have been thinking? "Oh snap! Another successful peanut butter cup smuggling. Don't filmgoers know that most theatres rely on their concessions stands to stay afloat? If there continues to be scofflaws it will most certainly mean the demise of the modern-day movie-going experience."  
 Just a word,SMOOTH...Kem's unique vocal and musical style make his album so different and sparkling...He is full of fire in a peaceful and harmonious mood, which is incredible...  Both of his albums are classics,I think, though this one is not as various as the debut.. 
 I am an avid reader, and this book was a Great read. If you want to know the truth about what is going on in America today, with no bull, this book is for you. I now own all of the books Ann Coulter has ever written, and would recommend them to read for anyone, seeking the truth 
 This book is well worth the price but more than that it is well worth the time it takes to read it.  My time is very valuable to me.  I don't like to read a book and discover that I already know three-quarters of the contents.  The material in this book is fresh and potent.  It appears as if the author undertook a lot of original research.  Rather than rehash tired old clichs about setting goals and rather than sighting frequently used antidotes he went down a new path, offering considerably new material that, from my perspective is right on target 
 It's the first Newbery Award winner to achieve full-cast audio production, it reaches out to families with a story of a 1950s family's retreat to the country to heal from spiritual wounds suffered during the war, and it springs to life thanks to the spirited participation of the full cast production: what more could one wish for in an audio production? Cynthia Bishop and the Full Cast family do an exquisite job with Miracles On Ample Street, the unabridged presentation on cd leaves not a word missing, and an added folk song enhances the overall effort. Simply lovely. 
 Collaboratively written by David Cowan and Chris Arnold, Ley Lines And Earth Energies is a seminal and original guide to the energies of the Earth itself, and how those energies affect human health and well-being, as well as the effects such things have had in creating "sacred" places that simply feel special. A powerful, metaphysical spiritual guide to tapping into the infinite bounty of nature, and illustrated with black-and-white photographs and maps, Ley Lines And Earth Energies is a welcome and very special addition to metaphysics, geology, and Earth Studies 
 I bought this book after someone had recommended it on a discussion forum. And that person was right. This book is perfect for the person who wants to learn ASP .NET using C# language. It covers almost every aspect of ASP .NET and C#. It's straight to the point with good examples. It requires some basic knowledge of programming, so if you are a begginer programmer and want to learn ASP .NET and the C# language buy this book. 
 Listen, we all know the basics...eat less, exercise more...BUT this book tells you how to do this simply and compactly.  The book is worth the money for the tips alone but it also offers great lists showing what a real portion is (something we all need to be reminded of), what foods you should have all the time, some occasionally and some rarely.  They don't cut any food out of your diet, just explain to you how often you should eat it.  Wonderful book for those of you who aren't looking for that miracle, wonder diet and just looking for something that makes sense.  My husband and I now tell people we are on a new "food program" not a diet.  We are losing without being hungry or frustrated and losing at a responsible rate 
 This is a great book of five of the Madeline stories. I loved them when I was a little girl and I was able to pass these stories to my niece. 
 Peter David is perhaps the best writer of Star Trek fiction out there -- he has written many of absolute favorite Star Trek novels, Imzadi among them.  In creating the New Frontier series, David breathes new life into a stale series that has been tied to the vision of Gene Roddenberry or the producers of the television shows.  Not the case here.  David mixes old and new characters to create an exciting story that is both original and true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.  Among the new characters introduced Captain Calhoun is probably the best captain to sit a starship since Captain Kirk.  He has many of Kirk's qualities, but also the leadership skills of Picard and Sisko.  Peter David surrounds Calhoun with some old ST:TNG characters and new faces like Bourgoyne-172, a Hermat (hermaphrodite).  Burgoyne-172 is the kind of charactes the TV producers would have been too scared to tackle.  Overall, this book is a great new addition to the Star Trek universe 
 Historical fiction -- particularly Renaissance-era -- and financial thrillers -- of arcane commerce -- with nods to lovers of coffee -- are almost none of my favorite things.  Having thoroughly enjoyed "The Conspiracy of Paper" however I decided to give Liss the benefit of a brave attempt.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This multi-layered, intricately-plotted thriller gets more and more heated as it progresses, until I had to stay up half the night finishing the last half!  I'm no expert, but the historical research feels sound and the political situation of Jews in Amsterdam sounds plausible.  The machinations of the early Dutch futures traders was as opaque to me as today's markets (how can you make money selling short?) but the plot does not depend on any economic or historical knowledge for its power.  The human drama -- double-crossings, triple-crossings and petty vanity -- were all too real and immediate.  An excellent diversion, well written and engaging from the start 
  	Nicholas Sparks has found a way to grasp your heart in this tragic, yet happy love story. If The Notebook was a sad story then this one will leave you crying for hours. With the love between Theresa and Garrett, the ending of the book seems to take a dramatic twist that you would have never seen coming from the first time that Theresa met Garrett. This was a book that I enjoyed to read and found out that once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. The ending might have been tragic but the overall theme seems to remain clear. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a love before, or even fallen in love. Sparks always finds that way to leaving you weeping at the end. This was once again, another wonderful book by Sparks. 
 I have seen all of the Once upon a time in China films, I would have to say that they are the greatest films I have ever seen. If you like original Chinese Kung Fu films then you will enjoy this film. Jet Li is amazing, and Rosamund Kwan is great also. I reccomend this film to all viewers 
 I am a great fan of Marge Piercy's poetry - her skill at using simple and everyday language to capture everyday scenes and sensibilities in the inner and outer lives of strong women, and to shine upon them a sublime literary light - and so it was not difficult to convince me to break out of my usual reading, decidedly not science fiction, to spend time with this "time-traveling novel." That play on words, mind you, is quite intentional. I soon sensed, within the first pages, that this is the kind of story plotline (and the writing skill to make it succeed convincingly) that traverses time and retains meaning and interest, no matter the year. Some things change, some things never do.   Being familiar with Piercy's poetry and something of her own biography, I expected a feminist approach to the plot. Indeed, it was there, and this is why I was soon confident in my enjoyment of the novel, even if it did veer from my more typical reading choices. Whatever the genre, I like to read about strong and unique women. "Woman on the Edge of Time" has plenty, in the now and in the to be.   Consuelo (Connie) in the 1970s lives a life of poverty and abuse, when domestic violence is as common as air, and women survive all too often by selling themselves out as objectified beings, bodies without minds, without souls. A pimp beats up "his" women to maintain order, in this case, to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, and a scene of violence ensues, in which Connie is made the villain rather than the victim. She can say nothing to prevent herself from being institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital, called mad, whereas the male's voice, that of the pimp's, holds unquestioned weight. He has her out of his way to create more victims.   I couldn't help but draw parallels here with another literary classic, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" by Ken Kesey, and even some undertones of Margaret Atwood's "Handmaid's Tale," but Piercy succeeds in making this story her own. Connie strives to maintain her sanity by traveling in time to another life in 2137, assisted by future person (Piercy uses "per" as pronoun, thus avoiding gender designation of she or he in this future), Luciente, a kind of almost andrygenous being. In that future, she explores a life much more pleasing, if not utopian, and in series of trips, explores this future world in its treatment of relationships, the interchange of genders and generations, the workings of community and government, the balance between work and play, spiritual evolvement, and even the occasional war. For it is not utopia, but a constant work in progress, however more evolved than our current day, with humankind in an ongoing mode of self-improvement.   No less fascinating is a shorter description of a darker parallel of life in the future, when Connie misses her usual destination and lands instead in a future that could just as easily, one fears, evolve from our current time. In this future, women are even more objectified than they are today, creatures resembling comic book and Barbie doll fantasy proportions, created by plastic surgery, produced specifically and only for the erotic pleasures of men, becoming sexual slaves. Mind reading allows for no privacy, no chance of escape. A woman might only think of the possibility of escape, and already she is reined in and punished. It is a world of callousness and cruelty, domination of gender over gender, power and greed ruling all, happiness for none.   In the hospital, woven through the story, Connie struggles for her sanity, as the doctors in power rule out any possibility of what they cannot understand, puzzled by her episodes of "unconsciousness," and many in the ward are forced to undergo brain-altering surgery. Connie, too, undergoes repeated surgeries. Her attempts at escape, sometimes in mind but sometimes also in body, can be heartrending, as she comes so close, so close...   This is a story worth reading, if not for intriguing storyline, than as a philosophical treatise on what could be, what might be, what a future for humankind might hold if we approach it with understanding. Whether Connie truly travels in time or only in fantasy is perhaps least important of all. Those who pick it up as science fiction fans might be disappointed if seeking high tech descriptions and complex alien worlds; this is not Piercy's intent. She is far more interested in exploring the evolvement of humankind if all are allowed to pursue their best, towards a world of harmony and a caring community that works on all practical levels.   While I still prefer Piercy's poetry to this sampling of her prose (my first, but probably not my last), her skill and imagination to produce worlds that intrigue as well as enlighten is worthwhile reading. 
 THIS CD HAS 4 BLUES SONGS SUNG BY GENE AUTRY. THE REST ARE MOSTLY EASY LISTENING.  THESE SONGS EXCEPT FOR "BACK IN THE SADDLE" HAVE A VERY MELLOW SOUND AND ARE VERY SPIRIT LIFTING.  ONLY GENE AUTRY COULD DO  SUCH A FANTASTIC JOB.  LOVE THE VARIETY AND THAT MELLOW VOICE 
 A brilliant book. Beautifully translated by Burton Watson, but the real focus lies not with him, but naturally on the poems of Han-Shan, a Chinese poet and philosopher. Han-Shan's poems are truly wonderful, and thankfully  devoid of the pretentiousness that belies much of the literature from that  era. Highly Recommended 
 It is a great book, a real whopper. And I'll be skinned alive and burned by an injun if it aint one of the moost enthralling books I've read. Colonel Crockett didn't have the greatest spelling, or punctuation, but it  was a great book. In the 1830's, Edgar Allan Poe wrote a review of the  book, criticizing its grammar, but what he forgot to say was how it was  exciting, and easy to read. At the time, it was the bestselling book in the  nation 
 This is a great inspirational book that will give you practical ideas for how to spread kindness in the world.  I picked this book up on a whim while browsing in the bookstore a few years ago, and I keep it at work to remind me of the need to do nice things just because you want the world to be better.    There are lots of books that talk about doing good from a selfish point of view, sometimes politely called "enlightened self-interest", but this is motivational book for people who want to be altruistic and intrinsically good.  If you want to reach Maslow's fifth level, then this is a book for you 
 This book is a prequel to the Liaden Universe stories. I assume that anyone who has read those stories will read this book no matter what the reviews say, so I guess I'll aim this review at someone coming in unfamiliar with the story.  (For those who are already hooked, this book lives up to all your  hopes except for one aspect -- it only tells half the story. The  book does end at a fairly natural break-point, and it is a compelling read on its own, but plot-wise it only serves to set up Book 2.)  So, if you don't already know the Liaden Universe, what should you expect from this book? Adventure! It is the story of a soldier (genetically bred to be a soldier) who is fighting against a remorseless enemy that plans to destroy all life in the galaxy. And worse yet, the enemy is winning.  The soldier decides to cast his lot with an underground group of mutineers, who he thinks are actually the best hope for defeating the enemy.  Then he accidently encounters a smuggler, and somehow the soldier, the smuggler, and an escaped slave end up on the run from some serious trouble. Is it the enemy? The regular high command? Someone else?  None of the three trust each other to share the same interests, but they do trust each other to watch their backs. The smuggler just wants to get the other two off her ship, the slave wants to find a legendary colony of escaped slaves, and the soldier wants ... well actually he is pretty closemouthed about what he wants. And about why he is carrying a tree with him wherever he goes.  And all of them have different groups of people hunting them, so it is not clear whether they are safer together or whether they just make a bigger target.  The action jumps from one planet to the next as the trio attempts to outwit their pursuers and each other. And all of this happens in the shadow of nearly certain doom for the entire galaxy.  The story ends at a natural break-point, but the plot is at least as unresolved as it was at the start of the novel. If you really hate that sort of thing, you might want to wait for Book 2 and read them both together. But if you just want a fast-paced adventure with some memorable characters, this book will provide what you are looking for.  And while you are waiting for Book 2, you can find and read all the other Liaden stories, to which this is just the prequel. I would suggest starting with the three-novel collection "Partners In Necessity". Or perhaps the pair of romances collected in "Pilot's Choice" 
 I really enjoy the whole series of these books.  After devouring the Stephanie Plum series by another author I was looking for a series that made me laugh like that one did.  I could so relate to the heroine in the Shopaholic books.  I like her have learned how to justify buying anything on sale 
 If you are a person that loves his Mercedes and enjoys working on it(or just likes to be in the know about your Mercedes and its' systems), this is the book for you. It is a compendium of articles from the magazine of the Mercedes Club of America and I can't say that I've ever seen a book of this kind that nails the topics that would appeal to the Mercedes enthusiast.  Early in the book, there is an article dealing with "when to let go" of your Mercedes, going over the pros and cons of repairing or selling your "baby". Real reasons were listed, each provided with solid, practical reasoning that does more to help those looking to either fix or possibly moving up to a newer model than any piece I've come across in 30 years of auto restoration.  The selection of articles run from changing the charcoal cabin air filter (a rather expensive job if one lets a dealer do it) to engine rebuilding, with many, many more practical selections included within these levels of difficulty. There is something for every Mercedes buff between these pages.  If you have a friend that loves Mercedes and likes to get his hands dirty, buy this book. Then, enjoy the way that they are consumed with devouring this tome cover to cover 
 This is an great book on growing rhododendrons/etc overall.  It has far more and better information on how to propogate (cuttings, layering, seeds, etc) than most other books, and the lists of "good-doers" are an excellent guide to someone starting out.  Many Rhododendron books are to a large degree picture books - listing hybrids with pretty pictures.  This book concentrates on the culturing, diseases, planting, propogation, hardiness, soil, how acidity affects nutrients, etc.    The strongest recommendation for me: My father, who's a 30+ year rhododendron and azalea collector, looked at the 12 or so books I'd picked up last year after getting bitten with the rhodie bug last year, and said this one was the one book he'd like to get a copy of for Christmas 
 Not as detailed as I would have liked; however, as a guide to the ideas behind the Blue Guitar effort, it exceeded my expectations.  Would have been nice if the excellent graphics and photography were supported with coffee table book sizing 
 In this Coltrane's classic record, three songs help us to put it in perspective. First, "Naima", a sont that will be played by Coltrane all his career long, showing his deep feeling in a melodic way, easy to approach for the beginner and to compare with the many versions of it recorded by him. Second, "Giant Steps", where the long 'sentences' and the armonics still remind the be-bop days, as if Coltrane were leaving that period. And third, "Mr P.C", where Coltrane shows his future 'shaken' way of playing, using a structure of two consecutive notes, high and low, up and down, each of them following a diferent line but, by this 'lateral playing', opening between those two lines an empty and free space where the melody is heard without being played. This is the Coltrane what will be found later in his marvellous album "My Favourite Things". As well, in this record, Coltrane is forgetting that 'deadpan' jazz who followed the cool period. Always without falling in sentimentality, Coltrane starts to fill that free and open space of his music with feelings. What is trully amazing is how love made him rebellious, and how it showed him the way to push modern jazz out of its ensconced position. To finish: don't miss "Countdown", a burst of technical power 
 When I received this book I started to read it and I couldn't beleive how fantastic it is, there is everything about studio what I always wanted to know, nice pictures, diagrams, huk up guides. i recommend it to bigginers and intermediate user.  Peace&Respect Mark 
 this is not a war story.  it is an insightful book that focuses on the political causes and repercussions of the tet offensive in early 1968. it starts with the attempted takeover of the u.s. embassy in saigon and ends with the decision of president johnson not to run for reelection. if you are looking at the military aspects of this offensive, this is not the book for you.  by jumping back and forth from washington to south vietnam to north vietnam, the author clearly explains how such a military failure on the part of north vietnam could result in such a huge victory that ultimately wins the war. it is very enlightening regarding what happens in the united states. it is much less so regarding south vietnam. from the north's perspective it gives a good understanding of why they did it, but is surprisingly lacking as to their reaction to the clear defeat.  one interesting aspect is that the book is written before the war ends. this gives the reader more knowledge than the author, but also shows how perceptive the author is in understanding the long term impact even to today.  of particular interest is how the individual bits of the story, whose impact cannot be understood at the time they occur, match up to change the climate in the united states and bring about the end of the johnson presidency and ultimately the vietnam war 
 Tweezerman Browmousse is a clear gel that you brush onto your eyebrows to hold them in place. I had tried other brands of styling gels for brows and was left very disappointed - they flaked and looked all stiff and gross.  Since I am such a huge fan of the Tweezerman tweezers, I figured I would give their Browmousse a try and boy, was I ever satisfied! This gel held my brows in place all day without a single stray. No flaking! No stiff brows!  And it is so easy to apply. It comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. It stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover.   Browmousse is a definite step up from all other brands I've tried. I will recommend this product to all my friends. 
 It is astounding to me that years after the Scopes trial, there are still misguided people who don't believe in the firm findings of science. Monkey Girl is an unsettling, addictively readable narrative focusing on the Dover trial and yet another battle between faith and science.  Amazingly, all too many so-called Christians -- who have commandeered a message of love and turned it into a message of bigotry, hatred and narrow-mindedness -- insist on a literal interpretation of the Bible.  Of course, it's a Bible that's cherry-picked: it totally ignores slavery, stoning, and proven geograpic and historical inaccuracies. For true believers of the Bible, football itself would be outlawed (don't touch anything made with the skin of a pig), and anyone who didn't keep the Sabbath holy would be stoned.  But it's more important for these simpletons to advance a religious agenda -- and a mean-spirited, hellfire agenda at that.  The result is not just "who is right."  Our country -- alone in the Western world -- has trouble meshing science and religion (and there CAN be a place for both).  As a result, our kids fall far behind in science, and other countries race past us in this new age.    There is a place for religion:  in the church and in the home.  It is not in the schools.  Our forefathers had the foresight to advocate a separation of church and state.  That was over 250 years ago.  It's a shame that their descendants do not have the common sense to follow what was put in place back then.  This book needs to be required reading for all schools -- before it's too late and America becomes a theocracy (which, if it were up to Scalia, it would be).  
 I found Diane Gossen's book to be an excellent resource for building classroom community and individual responsibility. The "restitution" process transformed my high school classroom. Discipline problems disappeared immediately so that we could get down to the business of learning and discovery. Gossen's practical strategies work for teachers and parents..... and are a 'must' for pre-service teachers 
 As though its a mix of Nickleback and pure talent, with a vocalist of pure prefection, and guitar riffs that boggle your mind.  I dont plan on buying it, but the samples are a good enough taste for the future 
 I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again 
 R3ad what Eric Wilson "novelist"  wrote because I totally agree with him. 
 Nice tips for golfer at all levels, don't have to read the entile books, each pages have different tips to help/advice the game of golf.  Will be nice just flip open a page each day during golf seasons 
 This manual is very detailed, valuable and easy to follow because there are great number of illustrations that immediately make it clear what and how should be done. I read it quickly and achieved impressive proficiency with Photoshop Elements 4. The program is great and this manual is a valuable addition to it. Highly recommended 
 In an expansion upon his earlier works in U.S.-China relations, this latest by William C. Triplett II is an unflinching examination of North Korea.   Triplett uses his skill as historian and political analyst to present an insightful inspection of the North Korean crisis, the Chinese nexus and policy prospects for future engagement.   Triplett deftly weaves the complex issues of communism, weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, terrorism, the U.N. and political theory into a single work with clear prose and cogent reduction.  This book is an excellent choice for those who would like to become well informed on the crisis and controversy surrounding Kim Jung Il and his father Kim Il Sung.  Likewise, the thorough analyses of political missteps and contemporary hypotheses for future engagement make this a must read for any who wish to remain abreast of the latest political theory on communist Asia 
 A good friend of mine convinced me to buy this book.  "You'll love it" she said.  "You will discover funky things about you and me" she said.  So I bought a copy and immediately hated the cover ~ but after reading the first two pages I was hooked!       "Compare" takes six major elements of personality - IQ, Creativity, Romance, Sex, Happiness, Work Ethic - and gives us a fresh perspective on each.  You learn interesting tidbits about each topic, then get to take scientific, yet fun, quizzes on each.  Then the amusement really begins, you compare your scores, thoughts, and feelings to all the other people who have taken these tests at universities around the world.  You truly get to learn about yourself then see `how you compare' to everyone else.     This is not your typical self-improvement book.  In fact, I'd really call it a book on understanding others.  Hint: It is more fun to take these tests and read the thoughtful commentary with friends.  You can really learn about what pushes their buttons and what makes them tick.     So, once you get past the awful cover photo, you will be delighted with this book.     
 I've seen this movie many times, and I was looking for it everywhere, I finally found it on [...]!  For anyone who had any rebelian in their teenage years, this is hilarious, you'll love it if you havent seen it already 
 A well written, and most interesting book.  If you are an animal lover, you will be most intrigued by what all animals really think, they are cer tainly not dumb, and this book makes me realise that they are just like children but in a different outer coating!! So the protection that they should have by law , needs to match that of children . although this is my own point I have to say.!  A thoroughly enjoyable read, easy to pick up and put down at any time.. The more we can learn to communicate with animals, the less they will suffer, and soon may this happen.  AJD2 
 A heart-warming tale which at the end you will beleave there must be Fairies 
 I've found this book to be incredibly practical and effective for toning and firming the abdominal region.  Although you will need a more rigorous exercise program to truly obtain a 6 pack, this is the program to start with to eliminate any soft area around your stomach and love handles and allow you to actually SEE your abs.  This book has helped me to go to the next level.  Includes great diet and lifestyle suggestions as well.  Recommended 
 i like it.  i was pleasantly surprised.  simple.  i didn't even know it has a keyboard drawer.  that was a bonus.  
 This is truly a classic novel containing much more that the movie 1946 movie left out...if you have seen that movie, then you owe it to yourself to read the book 
 I don't rate many books with 5 stars but this is a wonderful exception.  It is not your typical legal thriller, beautifully written and seasoned with bits of carefully crafted humor.  You simply cannot miss this book 
 As in all of the writings by Elizabeth Bishop, The Collected Prose allows the reader to open the door into her masterfully brilliant and private world of thoughts.  I took this book to the beach each night before the sun  went down and read one or two of her poems ...  Bishop's ability to connect  our everyday actions with a deeper, higher meaning makes this book one of  my all time favorites.  She is truly a wonderful creator and writer 
 I was thrilled with Debbie Macomber's latest Cedar Cove book.  Well worth the wait.  The characters were well developed from the previous books in the series, along with a few new faces.  The storyline had some unexpected twists and turns to maintain a steady attention flow for the reader.  As a resident of 'Cedar Cove,' I am constantly amazed at how accurately Debbie Macomber portrays our town, the surrounding area, and the unique flavor of Northwest life 
 Lots of action and typical John Woo action film.  It's interesting to see American stars (Travolta and Slater)act under his direction.  Travolta's performance is excellent as the antagonist.  
 This is one beautiful novel!  Set in Medieval times, fifteenth century England, The Innocent tells the story of young Anne.  Having survived an attempted murder when she was newborn, Anne is a peasant girl who works for English aristocrats.  Anne is a beautiful young woman who would have had a much more difficult time in her workplace had it not been for her special abilities as a healer.  Her gifts take her as far as looking after the queen.  And then Anne meets King Edward IV.  She moves into the palace to work for the royals -- where an intense, bittersweet affair with the king begins.  There are various twists throughout the novel.  I loved the language of this novel.  The backdrop of the struggles the royals had in Britain is fascinating and the storytelling is lyrical and beautiful.  The story of Anne touched me in many levels.  I couldn't keep the book down as she endured all sorts of obstacles and succumbed to her passionate love affair with King Edward IV.  The historical references are marvelous and the secondary characters, though in some cases underdeveloped, are compelling.  Some readers have complained that this novel reads like a historical romance.  There is a romantic subplot centered on Anne and Edward, but there are so many other elements to this novel.  You only have to read the synopsis to know that there is some romance in the novel.  It is too bad that the aforementioned aspect of literature isn't everyone's cup of tea.  I like some romance in literature.  Anyway, The Innocent is one of the best reading investments I've made this summer.  I recommend this novel most highly and I can't wait to pick up The Exile. 
 Larry Bond has again written a very good book that will keep you reading well into the night and the next morning. I find "Dangerous Ground" to be a book that is very concise in it's technical detail and a book that will make you want to keep reading 
 I absolutely LOVE the sound of Barlow Girl.  While their music is amazing, each song has a wonderful message that speaks to the heart. The CD has a mix of upbeat songs and slow emotional songs. I would recommend this CD to anyone. You won't be sorry you bought it.  
 Non-stop action, following the author's novel, the Ezekial Option... this is too close to current events, and too well done to leave on the shelf 
 Although I have contributed several hundred reviews to Amazon and I am even classified as one of their top one thousand reviewers, I never investigated how Amazon provides its authors with some terrific tools that would facilitate the promotion and selling of their books. However, when I came across Brent Samson's Sell Your Book On Amazon, I realized how Amazon makes it possible to reach a worldwide audience almost without too much effort, as pointed out by Dan Poynter in the book's Foreword.    Sampson is the president and CEO of the self-publishing company, Outskirts Press and he has published two other books, Self-Publishing Simplified and Publishing Gems: Insider Information for the Self-Publishing Writer.   As indicated in the introduction to Sell Your Book On Amazon, it is crucial to grasp that Amazon is one of the most customer-centric companies in the world. Their business formula concentrates on deciphering what customers want and providing it, as well as using technical innovations to discover what the customer even doesn't know they want, and deliver that as well. Furthermore, as anyone who is familiar with Amazon realize, all customer online experiences are personalized. Amazon has the knack of keeping a record of what we searched for in the past and what we purchased.  Sampson rightfully claims that the last "two components work synergistically to create an amazing online marketing opportunity." With all of this in mind, Sell Your Book On Amazon provides its readers with the necessary tools to leverage these ingredients and profit from them.    Divided into ten chapters, Sampson explores how books are presented and sold on Amazon. To help the reader in his analysis, he provides his own ranking system pertaining to the tactics he examines wherein a five star rating is highly recommended and a one star is one that should be avoided, unless unusual circumstances apply.    The first chapter looks at the way a book is listed on Amazon showing a difficult way and an easy path to follow. We then go onto learn about AmazonConnect, Amazon profile, Author photo & caption, About Me section, your profile Page, your Amazon blog, your bibliography, latest activity, reviews, listmania and Amazon guides, Amazon friends,search suggestions and tags and wikis.   An entire chapter is devoted to a detailed dissection of the Book Detail Page and it is here where Sampson uses as an example his own page pertaining to his book Self-Publishing Simplified. It is advisable when reading this important chapter that you do so in front of a computer in order to reap maximum benefits from the advice and suggestions offered. It is here where we find out about such tools as telling a friend, additional image views, product promotions, best value and better together, customers who bought books of a similar nature, editorial reviews, sales ranking, and the other topics you find on the Book Detail Page.    The remaining chapters discuss such topics as listmania and what this is all about, So You'd Like To...Guides, additional possibilities, BXGY where you pay Amazon to list your book in association with another book, pricing considerations, where I was surprised to learn about the percentage Amazon takes from each sale.  At 164 pages, with many illustrations and sidebars sprinkled throughout that succinctly sum up important tips and a useful index, this book without doubt will prove to be a valuable asset for authors who wish to successfully sell their books on Amazon.

 Little Town on the Prairie, by Laura Ingalls Wilder  After the long, long winter the shining sun warmed the Dakota prairie. The Ingalls moved back to their shanty on their claim, and life continued. Work took up all their time in the spring. Pa had a new plow for breaking the prairie sod; it spared the horses, and Pa too. After the planting was done Pa and Laura built the missing part of the claim shanty; now there was two bedrooms. There is a new problem in the cornfield; gophers ate half of the kernels. A good cat would help here. Pa loses some of his hair to a mouse. The many new settlers resulted in the need to organize a county. When Pa returned he brought a kitten for them to raise. Pa worked as a carpenter in town building the new church. Laura hoped she could get a job teaching school when she turned sixteen. Pa could not hunt game, but could only buy meat. Mrs. Brant would give a setting of eggs, so they would have chickens (if hawks or weasels or foxes didn't get them). Better times were coming! Their little kitty killed its first mouse. Pa tells Laura she could work in town sewing shirts for bachelors. Laura had never seen a store that sold only dry goods. She also saw another type of family life. Laura also saw two drunken men.  After six weeks of work, Laura experienced a lay-off. The Ingalls got 14 chicks, a gift from Mrs. Boast. The Fourth of July starts with a "BOOM", and Laura walks to town with Pa and Carrie (Chapter 8). They hear firecrackers and a speech. There is a threat from "Spanish needle grass",  and blackbirds are eating the shocked oats. "Earthly life is a battle" said Ma (p.89). Chapter 9 tells of the complications in women's dresses. The blackbirds were devouring their corn and oats. Pa shot as many as he could, and they found they were good to eat. The new school year sees Mary going away to a college in Iowa. Laura and Carrie return to the town school, and note how it has grown in the last year. Laura is surprised to find Nellie Oleson at school! Nellie puts on airs, but Pa tells Laura that Mr. Oleson lost his business and is just like the other homesteaders (p.135). In the fall they picked and packed vegetables for winter in town. The town was prepared for a harsh winter. But little Carrie was thin and pale. The new teacher Miss Wilder seemed to favor Nellie Oleson. There is trouble, and Laura and Carrie are sent home from school by the teacher. The children resent this teacher, and were disorderly. Nellie was two-faced (p.172).  One morning Almanzo offers Laura a ride to school, and they exchange name cards. The people in town start a literary society for their entertainment and education. Pa Ingalls suggests a formal organization could get in the way of the functions (Chapter 18). They chose sides for a spelling match. On Thanksgiving they attend a church supper. In late March they are entertained by a minstrel show. The new grass shows in April, and so does a surprise blizzard. Two newcomers from the East were lost (they did not dig into a haystack). Kitty caught more gophers, and some blackbirds. Mr. Owen, the new teacher, taught Willie Oleson to do better in school. The Ingalls family goes to the revival meeting. Almanzo walks Laura home from the revival meeting every night. Laura was invited to a sleigh ride. They celebrate their first Christmas without Mary, and feel sad. Laura meets Mr. Brewster, who is looking for a new teacher in their district, and wants Laura! Laura accepts this job offer, contingent upon getting a teaching certificate. The Superintendent of School tests and passes Laura to teach. Laura will start next week. Pa is on the school board, and knows Mr. Brewster. 
 This book is full of useful tips on how to incorporate this lifestyle into your own home.  Mr. Seo offers suggestions and tips that allow someone to bring eco-living into their life on a small scale or a larger scale depending on your desire.  I tried out some of the suggestions with my family and they loved it!!  It is a great start to turning my home into a stylish eco environment - on a budget no less!  Thanks for the great ideas 
 SECRET TEACHINGS is equisitely written, inspiring and offers new hope for the human species and ultimately for the planet. Buhner's poetic writing is often trance inducing. He superbly describes the territory of the sacred and makes navigation of interspecies communication easily accessible. He lays out the map so all we have to do, is the work. Reading this book, I kept hearing a voice inside saying, "I want this." I knew to what the voice was referring, a life of vastly rich and varied experiences  that went far beyond the surface of ordinary daily life. The teachings in this book have become my life guide.   This work is an integration of well documented research on the heart as an organ of perception, writings by those, such as Kabir, Geothe,Thoreau, James Hillman, and others, past and present, who have travelled this way as well as the authors own poetry and life experiences.   SECRET TEACHINGS is a must read for anyone who is intersted in deepening their life experience, who is inclined to go beyond reductionist methods of being in the world and for those who hunger to feel the touch of spirit on their body.   The book is easy to read and easy to skip around in from section to section, following your heart and interests.  Buhner lays out in fine detail the process of depth perception; of seeing beyond the surface of things with "the unworn sides of your eyes."    At the end of the book there are several exercises to enhance your awareness of the world while reclaiming the parts of you that have been sequestered away so that with practice, we can once again walk in the world as an integrated 360 degree personality, with joy and sponteneity.  
 Our local membership store was selling this for $3.36 and, as the neighborhood cat person, I bought it solely on that basis.  We're not Steven King fans but my wife & I both liked this film.  If nothing else, you have to appreciate the talent of the people who trained the cat(cats?) for a very significant role, especially in the last story.  Using the cat's perilous journey to save a young girl as the anchor to tie the three stories together worked well. The acting was, for the most part, excellent although the young Drew Berrymore didn't show the level of terror you'd expect in her situation.  As a child actor, though, you can forgive that.  Cat people could like the film based on the cat actor alone and be pleasantly surprised to find it's also a truly good film.  We now have hope that Cookie & Phoebe will save us from the monster in our walls 
 awesome cd. great singing by both the kids and adults and just plain cute.  excellent for car trips or plane rides.  good times when listening to this cd. very good 
 In my opinion, this is the best book in the Anita Blake series.  Edward calls on Anita to settle the debt she racked in by killing Harley, and so she travels to New Mexico, leaving behind her personal troubles and emotional crisis - giving herself and the reader a break for once. The action, characters and situations Anita gets herself into in this book are more complex and interesting than any before, and certainly better than the emotional and sexual escapades that await the reader in all the following books 
 I heard the author on the radio and thought this sounded interesting, it was definitely worth it.   I'm an architect and have worked on a few retail projects, although no malls yet, so I could easily identify with Gruen.  He seemed both to be a naive dreamer and a very calculating businessman. He was also caught up in the American cycle of trying to make one more buck.  Gruen's story made me rethink the reasons why Americans love shopping so much--all the lights, art, and designs do nothing but make us believe that shopping is enjoyable. Is it really?  Gruen's story also made me think about why architects think they can solve the world's problems with better buildings; I guess it goes with the territory 
 Now available in an updated edition which has expanded to include a brand new chapter, Hogan is a very highly recommended biography of Ben Hogan, one of the greatest professional golfers in history. Ben was a man known to practice until his hands bled, and who deliberately used equipment without logos despite the wealth he could have gained by contracting such de facto advertising deals with corporations. Ben has been a mystery to many, a hero to some, and a golfing legend to be remembered for generations to come. Hogan is very highly recommended and inspiring reading for professional golf enthusiasts in general, and nostalgic Ben Hogan fans in particular 
 I was a little skeptical about a "learn while you drive" product, but this one is very good.  I know Spanish and some French, so much of the Italian sounds familiar and flows well from what I already know.  The instructor is excellent... not condescending, doesn't move too fast, and inspires confidence.  And for heaven's sake- don't even think of buying just the two-CD "intro" version!  If you are at all serious about being able to learn and speak Italian, the first two CDs will only "open the box" and whet your appetite without really teaching you enough to make sense 
 This is perhaps the greatest book authored by my uncle, Victor Hugo Boesen. He worked diligently with Curtis' daughter and other members and  friends of the Curtis family to research and to write this book. The  photographs are stunning. It is a must read for anyone interested in the  history of the American Indian and Curtis' crucial role in recording this  history. This book has been translated into French and German. Victor  Boesen served as a war correspondent for Liberty Magazine during World War  II and was present at the signing of the peace treaty on the USS Missouri.  His writings appeared in Life, Look, the Los Angeles Times, and  other  major periodicals and newspapers 
 Keith is a legend, but it might not always be for the right reasons. Of course he is the main engine that fuels the Rolling Stones machine, but once you read this book, you get to see the other reasons that have made him a well known icon. This man helped write the songs for a generation, and we are able to get an insight into the man in this biography. We cam see into his childhood, that first meeting with the man he would ultimately become famous with, Mick Jagger, to his decade long struggle with drug use and abuse. This guy defines rock and if you like the Stones, you need to read this book and get an insight in the man behind the ban 
 I'm interested in a lot of different things, and good books is a way to educate yourself on the basics of almost anything. I picked up this book to satisfy my curiousity on model rockets, and boy was it satisfied. This book covers the subject better than anything I have read on model rockets. If after reading and understanding this volume, you still have questions, you should probably not get involved in model rocketry. Highly recommended for beginners and experience rocketeers alike 
 It's an often overlooked part of the superhero genre: the super prison. But a necessity of the convention. After all once you've caught the big bad villain and he's been convict of his heinous crimes, where are you going to put him?   Lockdown is a fairly generic prison specialized in contain convicted felons with super powers or access to fabulous gadgets or both. Like anyting else, it can be altered to fit what ever terrain you want to put it. PC supers can either go undercover as prisoners or help out the guards. Extra villains are provided in case you want a prison break to introduce new bad guys to your campaign.   Many is the time that whenever the villain of the week is caught, that's all the campaign deals him or her. The trial and incarceration is glossed over or ignored altogether. So this is primarily a GM book, but a necessary book. Not getting this book is leaving a hole in your campaign world you very well regret later 
 This is a fab book............ loaded with so much info and folklore......... lots of laughs and pondering what life on the high seas was like aboard vessels of all types........ Great present for the skipper in your lif 
 I LOVE this CD. Melissa's voice is absolutely beautiful on each song. Some highlights of the album are:  -Alive -Kiss Goodnight -Outside Looking In -Safe Place To Hide  With her beautiful voice, no wonder her first single "Alive" was #1 for six weeks in a row in singles sales. Melissa's music should definately get airplay in the States if she keeps this up.  RECOMMENDED! 
 A must see for those fans of courtroom drama and historical war movies.  "The fact of the matter is that war changes men's natures. The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men. The tragedy of war is that these horrors are committed by normal men in abnormal situations; situations in which the ebb and flow of everyday life have departed and have been replaced by a constant round of fear and anger, blood and death. Soldiers at war are not to be judged by civilian rules...Even though they commit acts which calmly viewed afterwards could only be seen as unchristian and brutal...[W]e can not hope to judge such matters  unless we ourselves have been submitted to the same pressures, the same provocations, as these men, whose actions are on trial." - Closing speech by Major Thomas 
 The first seven songs on this CD featured in 'Help!', the Beatles' second movie (1965). Sounding great & coherent, they fully show the fab four's progress in making increasingly complex arrangements.  The original 'Help!'-LP exists in two versions. One merges its mentioned seven Beatles-songs with this movie's other music: orchestra, violins & no vocals.     The other LP-version, as continued on this CD, reserved its side 2 for a nice hotchpotch of Beatles leftovers, the world-famous 'Yesterday' standing out.  Although the movie 'Help!' wasn't as successful as it predecessor 'A hard day's night', its songs still honorably rank among the many other great Beatles-compositions 
 Magic, mystery, romance and burglary are all part of this extremely captivating adventure.  I fell in love with the characters immediately even knowing they were "good" thieves - hence "Honest Illusions."  The book begins with Luke Callahan coming back into Roxanne Nouvelle's life after a 5 year absence and then immediately flashes back to the time approximately 10 years previous when Roxy was 8 and Luke 12 when Luke joined the carnival w/Max Nouvelle, his daughter, Roxy, Lily, Mouse and their right hand caretaker back in New Orleans, LeClerc.  The flashback continues throughout more than half of the book, setting up the reader for the background information needed to tell the full story.  I felt it was necessary and definitely kept the reader interested to go back to the beginning, unlike some of the reviewers who felt the flashback was too long.  The book then picks up to the current time, but to me, the continuity of the story completely hinged on the background information.  Since I don't want to give any of the plot away, I will end my review right here.  This is a story that I would definitely re-read and hated to see end; a sure fire plot for an excellent movie 
 My three year old grandsons, who are twins, just love this book. Everytime they come to visit, the first thing they look for is The Very Hungry Caterpillar board book. The boys sit and know every word in the book and sometimes read the story along with the The Very Hungry Caterpillar DVD. I had to order another copy of the book so each had their own to follow.  The story is easy to understand for their age and the illustrations are beautiful and very colorful 
 I first purchased this book when I was a freshman in college seven years ago. It is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing I have ever read.  I love the plastic tabs that mark each section.  This guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section.  So for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the MLA style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab.  I have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college.  I really wish I had this book when I was in high school.  I highly recommend this book to any high school, college, graduate student or writer.  I especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities, I myself have ADD and before I got this guide I could not understand how to write a paper in the MLA style or in any style other than a book report.  I promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published 
 This book contains a lot of information on the studies and polls the authors took of the greatest managers in the world. A lot of it is very tedious reading, however there is a HUGE pay off.My key learning from this book was: ALL great managers live outside the "BOX" of coporate America. They are not trapped by the "rules", they see the rules as only guidelines to achieve whatever the real purpose is of their business. They focus on the end result and not on doing things for the sake of doing them.I have found this book to be true in real life in watching promotions over the past 15 years in my own company. It could have been written better in a better format, but if you love information you will love this book. It's style is a lot like the book "The millionaire next door" 
 We had to read it in Elementary School, and I want you all to know, that is an awesome book, but yet so sad. It made a lot of us cry, a lot of us, but it is so worth the tears because it makes you realize that people can die soon and tragically, and especially those with family. So cherish your family while you can, and please, if you can not think of anything to read, please pick up a copy of this book. It really does not matter the age for this book, I think it is a book for all ages 
 Ive already had this for a few months now. its the same as the import from england.. im a true chimaira fan, i paid like $35 for mine haha. its definatley awesome, clayden and malignant are 2 must have songs for any chimaira fan!! the live stuff is the same songs from the live in holland part of the dv 
 Like the previous reviewer I also have the unabridged audiobook recording put out by Brilliance Audio but I like it, but having the adapter really makes a difference and I listen to most of my audiobooks with headphones anyway using my Walkman and CD/cassette tape boombox. I found my adapter in Barnes and Noble but it can also be found in the company's mail order catalog and online web site. The Catalog is called Audiobookstand and the website is [...]. BTW: You can listen to these audiobooks without an adapter if your car or home stereo receiver, cassette or CD player has balance control and with that you basically just follow the same directions of the adapter. I tried it and it worked fine with no annoying sounds but I did have to adjust the balance a few times until I got it just right! As for the adpater, I personally found investing in it well worth it because I will often use my walkman to listen to audiobooks and because these unabridged audiobooks are pretty inexpensive with prices that range from 10 dollars to around 20 dollars verses companies that offer unabridged audio recordings for the same book at 50 dollars and higher. This audio cassette recording of Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady is read by Laural Merlington who is one of the best readers of audiobooks but even with that said I can understand why the previous reviewer was annoyed about the special adapter thing but I highly recommend this audiobook to anyone who has the BookCassette adapter or a stereo with a fully functioning balance controll knob and I also recommend the paperback book or the hardcover book 
 An excellent story of Auschwitz behind the scenes.  An extroidinary account of what one doctor experienced while he was a prisoner in the camp. A must read 
 My son loves this plug & play nickelodeon game.   it's easy to hook up and has many games on it.   My 4 year old son really is enjoying this game.   There is an option that lets the kids continue to play, even though they have used all 3 "lives"...  I'd recommend it - it's a cute game and we've giggled over the animations of sponge bob!   The games are simple enough but add a bit of challenge for the kids.  It's fun for adults too 
 Album rips from start to finish.  Less directionless tunes than Vs.  Drums are always intense and interesting as in the opener "2wice."  MOB is the Cream of art-punk, losing some of the textured shredery for a fresh live dynamic.  MOB also tactfully rediscovers previously charted relevance in a neo-Regean American social landscape.  Say "The Obliterati" whenever you find yourself in a discussion of old rock hacks reuniting ie Blondie and The New Cars.  
 Murderball isn't just a sports film- its a film about people, and it is a great film about people.  It is at times incredibly saddening, at other times inspiring, and again at others hillariously funny.  Some people may pass this movie by, thinking that is not pertinent to their lives.  Don't let that be you!  This movie will teach every person something they didn't know and it will change the way they think in some way.  My husband & I both give this movie five stars!  Watch it today 
 Cartridge is easy to install and works great! Transaction went smoothly....... 
 I bought this book a couple of weeks ago. I love it. Jeffrey describes it sooo beautiful and give you soo many information. About the people, language, history.... It is beautifully written 
 I really enjoy this camera;  mine has the Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens.  It works grewat- be sure to use the Memory Stick PRO media.  A great reasonable priced camera 
 I happened to pick this book up in a store because I had read one novel of Berger's, Pig Earth, which I thought was very good.  I knew he was an art critic, but I never had any particular urge to read art criticism; I didn't think visual art needed a lot of explaining.  Just reading the three page essay on Jackson Pollock convinced me that, at least regarding the type of criticism that Berger writes, I was wrong.  In a few sentences, he seems to capture the essence of what an artist has accomplished (or is trying to accomplish) in his or her work, and makes the work more vivid and meaningful than it was before.  Here is clear proof that finding words for one's experience of a work of art doesn't devalue it but makes it richer.  One of the things that makes these essays so gripping is that Berger is interested in something that seems to have fallen out of fashion in criticism: using art to identify the predicament of a culture. I remember, even before I picked up Pig Earth, being worried by the fact that Berger is a lifelong Marxist.  But there is nothing doctrinaire or repetitive about his explanations of phenomenon; he is a free intellect, and I would argue that just because Marx's solutions have been widely discounted does not necessarily mean that his diagnoses are also invalid.  In any case, Berger's priorities are always first exploring his subject, not imposing an orthodox framework on them.  The book, also, is not just about art.  Berger is a real man of letters; his essays range over every art form and subject, and in the space of a few pages he can marshall support for his points from a novelist, painter, poet, photographer, and historian.  He is never pretentious, because his primary objective is always communicating his argument with urgency.  I bought this essay on the strength of the Pollock essay alone, and I've discovered so many more that I could read again and again; this is really one of my treasured books (a good measure of which is the frequency with which it comes into the bathroom with me).  The tight construction of Berger's essays makes it hard to quote a section and have it make sense as an argument, but here are a few samples: "Nobody who has not painted himself can fully appreciate what lies behind Matisse's mastery of colour.  it is comparitively easy to achieve a certain unity in a picture either by allowing one colour to dominate or by muting all the colours.  Matisse did neither.  He clashed his colours together like cymbals and the effect was like a lullaby."  Or, in the essay on our changing relationship with animals: "Public zoos came into existence at the beginning of the period which was the see the disappearance of animals from daily life.  The zoo to which people go to meet animals, to observe them, to see them, is, in fact, a monument to the impossibility of such encounters.  Modern zoos are an epitaph to a relationship which was as old as man."  The essay on animals had a passage on nearly every page which made me want to put the book down and think for a few minutes, and I hope I'm not doing it a disservice by quoting a fragment.  Buy the book and read it all; there are few other collections that contain such a breadth of knowledge and insight.  Seriously, this is value for money 
 I'm really impressed with this book.  I found it to be well written, thought provoking, and easy to understand.  Actually it's exactly the type of reading I find most interesting of all.  I derived a kind of energy from the words because they took me to a place I somehow knew existed and felt, but never really understood ... I hope I didn't confuse anyone with that.  Anyway, I really do consider this book to be one of my most prized possessions.  I know it will be enjoyed by all who read it. 
 This cable does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I previously had a Boston Acoustic PV1000 sub hooked up with a cheap cable but always had problems with the bass sounding "boomy".  I just replaced the cable w/ this one from monster and regret that I didn't do it earlier.  My sub finally sounds the way it should.  I actually had the floor rattling until my wife came down from upstairs because she couldn't hear the tv up there.  If you have a decent home theatre system spend $30 for this cable, you won't be disappointed 
 I bought this book for my 14 year old daughter at her request. She says she really enjoyed the story and recommended it to her friends 
 This movie is my all time favorite movie.  The cast is awesome, you really feel the pain and anguish in Amalia (played by Lee Grant) as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son's life.  This movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved.  I love the way that Randal Kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless.  The movie at times feels a little forced but I can't think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours.  
 The Border Trilogy continues with THE CROSSING.  In the book's early going, sixteen-year-old Billy Parham visits an eccentric old Mexican man who is rumored to be a brujo.  Billy seeks this man's advise regarding the ways of wolves as Billy has been stymied in his attempts to trap a wolf who has wandered into New Mexico from Mexico.  As Billy is helping the old man rise up from his bed, McCarthy writes "The boy almost put his hat on the bed but he caught himself."  Now what is that supposed to mean, you may ask.  Perhaps some western readers of McCarthy may know the reference here, but for rest of you, here goes.    Hats on a bed are back luck - not only bad luck, but specifically the kind of bad luck that this Mexican man may be particularly susceptible to.  Here is what Texas Bix Bender writes in HATS AND THE COWBOYS WHO WEAR THEM, 1994, Gibbs-Smith:  "Seems the expression comes from way back when people believed in evil spirits - other than the ones you drink.  These evil spirits lived in the hair.  This probably came from static electricity in the air crackling and popping when you came in and took off your hat.  So, the idea was, don't lay your hat where you're gonna lay your head `cause evil spirits are spilling outta the hat.  It doesn't make any sense.  But then, superstitions seldom do."  So there you have it - why Billy caught himself before putting his hat on the bed.  
 This formulaic thriller tells the story of Muslim terrorists sneaking a nuke into the US with intentions to detonate it during Memorial Day ceremonies in DC. Returning hero, Mitch Rapp, the top counterterrorist expert and former field agent/killer, must race against time to foil the plot. While a bit jingoistic in its patriotism (there is no question who the good guys and bad guys are), this is Flynn's best book to date. It is fast paced and action-packed. It helps that Rapp's whinny, insecure wife Anna doesn't appear in this novel. Rapp is still a bit too arrogant, pushy, hot-headed, and condescending; makes it somewhat difficult for the reader to totally like the hero of the book. I don't think this was the intention of the author, just a result of bad writing. However, it was very entertaining.  
 If you enjoy the atmosphere and imagination of Philip Pullman, Garth Nix or Philip Reeve, then you're sure to like Chris Wooding; one of the handful of fantasy-authors who (by some miracle) does not feel the need to fill their fantasy worlds with elves, dwarfs, wizards, dragons and every other fantasy cliché that's been done to death since Tolkien published "The Lord of the Rings". As a lover of fantasy myself, I find the sheer lack of originality of many fantasy-authors and the resignation of readers to go on reading these books anyway a constant source of depression. The flimsy excuse of both authors and readers seems to be: "all fantasy is like that."  Reader, it is not.   Some authors are willing to explore new territory, and Wooding is one of these. "The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray' is set in an indefinable time-period of London: it appears to be mid-19th century, but events are occurring that bear no resemblance whatsoever to our historical knowledge of the period. The city is haunted by creatures known as `wych-kin', a variety of monstrous and grotesque creatures that prey on the city's inhabitants. The only defence against such mysterious and deadly beings are the `wych-hunters', such as Thaniel Fox and his mentor Cathaline Bennett. They live turbulent, dangerous and (more often than not) *short* lives as they hunt down and destroy the wyches, driven by a desire to rid their city of the supernatural infection that is slowly eradicating the world.  Thaniel is a seventeen year old wych-hunter, partnered to Cathaline since his father's death (who was also a hunter). Together the two scout London, finding new methods to destroy the wych-kin and keep the citizens safe, whilst remaining on the outskirts of society. It is on one such patrol of the city that Thaniel discovers an incoherent and dishevelled girl wandering about in her nightgown. Feverish and with no memory of how she came to be wandering the night-time streets, Thaniel takes her home in order to untangle the mystery. Who is this mysterious girl? What does the tattoo on her back signify? And does she have anything to do with the influx of wych-kin roaming the city? The intrigue and action doesn't let up for a single page as Wooding unravels the mystery, sustaining interest and excitement till the very last page.   His best effort is in the creation of a detailed and intoxicating atmosphere, a fully-realised world filled with asylums, secret cults, upperclass neighbourhoods, beggar's communities, prostitutes, churches and parliament houses. London isn't just haunted by wych-kin, there are wolves that stalk the back-streets and the enigmatic psychopath Stitch-face who is yet to be captured by the authorities. The dark and dense atmosphere of the story will remain long after the book is finished. As dangerous and unwelcoming as it is, you can't help but be sucked into it. This alternative-London is just as much a character as Thaniel and Alaizabel themselves, and Chapter Twenty in particular is a remarkable example of how strong Wooding's creation is: for this one chapter the main protagonists are completely absent, and instead Wooding centres on the inhabitants of London and their terrifying ordeals against the wych-kin. It's creepy, imaginative and (most importantly) *original* stuff.   Thaniel, Cathaline and Alaizabel are all likeable characters, though we never really get inside their heads. Though sympathetic, they are more like action-figures than three-dimension characters. However, if Wooding is short on characterisation, he more than makes up for it in action and ideas; setting, plot, pacing and atmosphere - it's all wonderfully *new* as opposed to another fantasy-rehash. Though not for the faint of heart (as it can get a little gruesome at times) "The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray" is a great read. 
 Fern's relationship with her mother Nora has always been strained, ever since the messy divorce due to Nora's affairs with women. Nora has eventually settled down with Jeanne, but the tension between mother and daughter remains. Fern's best friend drops her baby into Fern's lap and slowly drifts from the picture, and Fern's most stable relationship is with her dog Lucky, but with the dog's health waning, this seems to be ending as well. And when Nora begins another affair, Fern is first to figure it out and leaps at the chance to judge her mother, but as events progress, she begins to realize her mother is human after all. And with Lucky dying, both mother and daughter come to better understandings about themselves and their relationship with each other. "Lucky in the Corner" is full of glorious complexities about us humans, and Anshaw has written this tale in a tidal mosaic, where episodes from the past and present interweave, blessing the reader with all aspects of these fascinating characters and leaving us with a sense of what family (especially those extended families of non-blood relatives) means 
 itz tru this izn't az scary az tha original texas chainsaw massacre, but i've allways found this movie very entertaining. Matthew McConaughey was brilliant in this. dude waz straight up psycho. this is horror/dark comedy. if your looking for something az scary az tha original then dont get this, but if ur lookin 4 somethin entertaining and fun to watch i highly reccomend this 
 Best book on lean that I have seen yet!  The book is just what I needed 
 I have read True Spirituality and found that it truly challenged me in my faith and how I live my life.  This is not light reading, but reading to change one's soul and how you live a Christian life.  It does not contain quick easy help steps, but rather your understanding of theology, who we are in Christ and what Christ has done for you.  This is a book I believe anyone who takes his/her relationship with Christ seriously should own and read. 
 Kudos to Doris Kearns Goodwin - this is an extensive book that really puts you inside the innner workings of Lincoln's cabinet.  Did the 'team of rivals' really work to help Lincoln?  Perhaps - but it seems more likely Lincoln kept the Republican party together by his appointments and then relied heavily on certain advisors and not others.    I am sure this is nothing new and will not change as time goes by.  Lincoln was a political genius.  This book only cements that legacy.  The book is quite a read - I give it a high rating and my full endorsement.    JV 
 I found this book quite interesting.  It provided alot of good information for someone who was interested in learning about other religions 
 Get Shorty is a fun fast read about Chili Palmer, a sort-of mob guy from Miami that goes to LA to get money from someone who is running.  He is really a loan-sharks right hand man, even though he doesn't want to be.  The characters are so well developed that you love them each in turn for the brilliance they give to the story.  Exceptionally written and more fun than the movie. A must read 
 I swear by the Betty Crocker Cookbook. I got mine before I got married (over five years ago), and I am always referring to it for tips, techniques and everyday recipes that you can't find in ordinary books/magazines. I kinda want a new one now 'cause it's even more detailed (I have the 9th Edition). Highly recommend it 
 the book is pretty good and thorough too.  this is a good version to get 
 I have always loved Paul Gallico as a writer, and this short story is one of my favorites of his work. It is a beautiful story that children may like, but adults will love. The story is about a lonely artist, Philip Rhyader, who retreats from society due to a hunchback and deformed hand. He lives in a lighthouse where he creates his works of art and tends to injured animals.  One day a young girl named Frith brings him a snow goose that has been injured. (I loved the book so much that I named my oldest daughter Fritha.) Although she is at first scared of Rhyader, a friendship develops between them as they tend the goose. After the goose is healed, it flies away but returns every year to stay with Rhyader for the season. The girl, Frith, returns each year when the snow goose returns. Rhyader falls in love with her but she does not realize it.  The book ends with the battle of Dunkirk when the British troops are trapped on the beach. Rhyader, who was unable to fight in the war because of his deformities, takes his small sailboat and crosses the channel several times, delivering the British soldiers to safety. On each trip he is accompanied by the beautiful snow goose.  I'll give you fair warning, the ending of the book is one of the saddest you will ever read. However, the message of love and friendship and hope conveyed in the book will make you want to return and read it over and over again. 
 This is a wonderful source of information on methods for analyzing spatial data. It is still reasonably current for this rapidly developing area in statistics. You won't find some of the latest research on the joint modeling of space and time. But I expect that Cressie is working on a book that will cover it. It is an encyclopedia of references. The author covers the gamut of techniques. This explains why the book is so lengthy. I think that if he plans a revision he will be more selective and only cover those methods that have proved to be the most promising. Here you can finally learn what kriging is and even see how the bootstrap can be applied to spatial data 
 This book is a classic of prosodic exposition.  (And understand, when I call a book a classic, I am not just lapsing into a cliche; it really IS a classic.)  Fussell shows us the relations between form and content, between rhyme and rhythm on the one hand and the function of these formal devices to illuminate meaning on the other.  The book also devotes a chapter to empirical observations on the properties of free verse, and it includes a concise bibliography of other works on prosody.  Highly recommended 
 Being a Steeler Fan, I have read both Terry Bradshaw's and Rocky Bleir's books, and while I found them interesting, I didn't get quite the feel for the individual as well as the game from their books as I did from Andy Russell's.  I am not just a fan of the sport of football, but a fan of the  players. As a fan of the individuals, I like to know as much about them as  possible.  Everything from their childhood and family life, through high  school and college, because all of that has an effect on their football  career and what they bring to the game.  Andy's stories about his life  after football give us a perspective on the good effects that the  commraderie and competitiveness of football can have on the rest of your  life.  I particularly enjoyed the chapter which tells of his visits to  combat areas in Vietnam. The American soldiers in the various hospitals had  the same reaction to American football players.  I totally understand that  reaction - meeting A Pittsburgh Steeler so far away from home helped the  soldier forget the harshness of war for just a few moments and go back to  all that is good in the world - good old American Football 
 Yes! It's another Bad Boy anthology which once again offers the reader a fun sexy romp in three short stories by some of today's hottest romance authors.  In Lori Foster's "Playing Doctor" Dr. Axle Dean is shocked and surprised when he spots sexy Libby Preston at a party. Not exchanging names they enjoy a sizzling kiss and a little more in the garden.  When he finds out Libby's secret...he hightails it out of there...only to be haunted by the memory of the time they shared.  Imagine his surprise when he walks into his treatment room and finds her sitting there.  Life has just gotten a little more complicated.  Will these two find a happy ending?  In Erin McCarthy's "The Lady of the Lake" Kindergarten teacher Violet Caruthers thinks she's found the perfect man to be the father of the baby she's always wanted.  Well, this is until she falls off of his boat...while dressed in a bikini, and left behind. Things look like they are only going to get worse...until she is rescued by baseball hottie Dylan Diaz. These two people are about to find out that things are not always as they appear and there is fun in finding red hot attraction where you least expect to find it.  In HelenKay Dimon's "Hardhats and Silk Stockings" Whit Thomas has the unfortunate luck of tangling with Hannah Bridges...one of the most frustrating women ever created. Too bad he also suffers from a twisted burning attraction for her. Imagine his surprise when opportunity hands Hannah over to him for one night of no hold bar pleasure. Will they walk away from what they find...or will they grab and hold it with both hands?  All three stories are sexy fun reads with entertaining characters. This is a perfect "vacation" read that offers some really "Bad Boys" who finally meet their match! Falling in love should be so much fun! 
 I love Entertainment Weekly.  This is a magazine that has everything current...outline of plot, reviews for movies, music, tv, dvds, books.  It keeps you current.  It is the one magazine that I go through from cover to cover 
 I originally got dragged to this movie and expected a Grisham-esque ripoff. However, I found this movie to be an outstanding study of the different roads people decide to go down in life - Duvall's cynical and heartless character shows us the dark and lonely one - and Travolta's character the bright, but still lonely road.  I bought the DVD so I can watch it every once in awhile and remind myself why it's best to be good and do the right thing - even if it means going broke in the process. John Travolta's revealing smile in the end is priceless.  
 Besides the original Miss Julia book, this is the best!  It has the humour and the Southern charm that the original captured. Some of the other Miss Julia books are a litte strident and formulaic, but, in this one, Miss Julia shows her Southern etiquette and her spunk to the reader's delight. The description of the race is very funny and her thoughts are clearly those of a woman trying to move with the times in spite of her better judgment. I thoroughly enjoyed it 
 I am new to learing the piano, but I got to the point where I felt that I wanted to understand the music I am practicing.  This book is excellent for explaining music syntax.  It also has a CD so you can hear what is being explained.  I have found that I enjoy practicing the piano more because now I see so much more on the music sheet.  I am understanding what is happening in the music and why it is written the way it is.  Don't let the title "Idiot's Guide to" put you off, it is an excellent and easily comprehensible book 
 Two things mar this otherwise fine tale of Alexandre Dumas' sword-wielding Musketeers - taking license with the book, and making it in two parts. True, the book has 67 chapters and covers a lot of 'ground' in telling the story. However, taking some of the events out of sequence with the book is something I have always disliked about going from novel to film. And purposely making the story go into an obvious sequel to tell the second half of the book...  The film does have an excellent cast, though, so one can overlook the problems mentioned above. And, there are some fine comedic episodes along with the dramatic sword fights.. 
 This volume is a great antidote to the "great man" school of history. It serves to remind us who the real movers and shakers are 
 The download process worked as advertised.  I have a 3 megabit/s DSL connection, but the download still took more than an hour for a 25 minute episode.  I was able to watch the movie on a Windows XP machine.  Unfortunately, I mostly use Linux machines, and it does not seem possible to view these files under Linux.  For this I subtract a star from the rating.  Regarding the story, it is a fun story which is better than the usual Nickelodeon fare 
 Popeye was created by E.C. Segar for his 'Thimble Theatre' and was actually an accident, never meant to be a hit. But his Popeye character took off and today is a standard well-known icon around the world. Here to celebrate his evolution is Popeye: "I Yam What I Yam!": an oversized, eye-catching catalog of strips in full color, the first of six projected volumes, showing his evolution from a background prop to a main character. A biographical article by historian Bill Blackbeard and a foreword by cartoonist Jules Feiffer completes an outstanding evolutionary survey recommended both for art libraries and general-interest public holdings - the latter may find the oversized volume a shelving challenge but no matter - it lends particularly well to display.

 I'm a big fan of 4 strings other albums and was happy to hear that they've kept their edge over the years. As the reviewers above have stated, this album is definitely worth checking out for anyone who has a taste for electronic music. great album all around, and was stoked to find it has a variety of different sounds in it 
 I received this book as a gift from someone who new I enjoyed the television show Dallas, and I can really say it was a treat.  I must say that Mr. Hagman had a very interesting life that goes way beyond what we know him best for: playing the merciless J.R. Ewing on Dallas and his other hit I Dream of Jennie.  From the get go, Larry speaks about his youth, being the son to Broadway star Mary Martin (famous for being Peter Pan), his father and tenuous relationship with his step-father Richard.  The book reads in a chronological order from boyhood, through his stint in the military (where he met his one and only wife Maj), to his first movie roles, through his television career and wraps up with his last series 'Orleans' and his liver transplant.   He has many stories which are entertaining and fun reads.  So fun in fact I wanted more and was disapointed only in the fact they weren't long enough or more of them.  Mr. Hagman had some fascinating quips and stories regarding such people at Burgess Meredith, Carol O'Conner, and other tv and silver screen legends.    But not everything was picture perfect....There were times of poverty, illicit drug use, and confronts his drinking issues which led to his liver transplant head on.  I was amazed at what a world traveler he was, even before his most memorable character of playing oil tycoon J.R. Ewing.  He had seen more of the world before his 20th birthday than most people do their whole lives, and many times early in his youth, he did it with no job or no money, but always had a positive outlook on life.  A very inspirational autobiography where Larry does show you the silver lining on all dark clouds.  Again, for me the trouble with this book was it just seemed to short....I would have loved to read many more of his 'tall, but true' tales, many of them with a martini or bottle of champagne in his hand. 
  One would think that after writing five completely charming novels about the despair of three orphans, Lemony Snicket would have trouble writing another novel that lives up to the creativeness, randomness, and humor of it's predecessors.  One would be wrong.  Snicket's writing is strong and hilarious as always-- it's the plot that makes this one sometimes drag.  While the story is mostly interesting, hearing about the Baudelaires climbing an endless flight of steps gets old after a while.  This is a small flaw in the story, and the rest of the novel is very strong.  It can be said that a writer who creates a character then readers hate and want to physically shake is a good writer, and this is what Snicket does when he creates the character of Esme, a new guardian of our favorite orphans, who only cares about things that are "in."  This story has many literally strong points that the previous novels in this series do not, such as 1. a red herring (a literal AND a figurative) 2. a huge element of surprise 3. heightened suspense 4. this book gives you a lot of information on certain things, but also leaves you with more questions.  This technique is often done by J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, and is a big reason for the series' success.  Readers will surely want to come back to have their questions answered, and with "The Ersatz Elevator," Mr. Snicket had undoubtedly secured a returning audience.  If all of the above doesn't convince you to read this sixth volume in A Series of Unfortunate Events, know this: reading Snicket's fun and informative narration will improve your vocabulary!  7/10 
 I've read this book a while back and am strongly considering reading it again. It is that good and it has pictures of the modern day stigmatists (when I say modern I mean 20th century). Some of these pictures were very eye popping. It makes you really understand how much Jesus loved humanity to go through the pain and suffering he went through. The book is very informative and well researched. I even saw the author on a television special where they were speaking about the stigmata and they spoke about his book there. Some people wonder if stigmata is real or if it is self inflicted. I think this book shows the difference between the real mystical stigmata and wounds that are self inflicted. I also found out while reading this book that people can be deceived b/c the devil can also plant the marks on people. Research is always done to every case before the stigmata is considered authentic. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn more about the stigmata. Like I said before, the book is very well written and researched. I only wish there were more books on this subject available 
 I am very picky with movies, especially thrillers and recently I have had a hard time finding a decent thriller. Once I heard about this movie and had a chance to view it I immediatly fell in love with it. This is very smart and fast-paced thriller that entertains the hell out of a viewer. Highly recommended 
 This book is a must read for all proposal and capture professionals:  1.  It is now in its 4th edition - lots of tuning, process updates, lessons learned, and continuous industry syncronization.  The first edition was great, each new edition builds on that success while continuing to add more value.  2.  The book is based on extensive first-hand experience with what works, what does not, and why.  Bob makes effective use of collaboration with other industry leaders and introduces processes that have withstood the test of winning.  3.  Although aimed at small businesses, the information is equally valid for businesses of all sizes.  4.  The focus is on winning, winning, winning 
 I am on the lookout for books that do not tell you what to do to improve, but rather concentrate on changing who you are.  The behaviors to change are easy if they come from a changed definition of who you are.  Personal Coaching for Results is a book that fits into that category...  It deals more with who we are rather than what we do.  It is obvious why Lou Tice has been successful with the message contained in this book - it touches peoples lives in a way that most books do not.  I would give it a "must read" recommendation 
 This is an excellent book. Michael Jackson resolves a number of major problems by drawing a distinction between the description of the problem domain and the description of the solution domain. This is needed because current object-oriented techniques (based on UML, for example) tend to be solution-oriented in the early stages of the software development lifecycle. This mindset can lead to maintainability problems later. Another 'gem' is that Jackson develops a scheme for decomposing a problem into simpler subproblems. This 'divide and conquer' approach has been known to mathematicians for hundreds of years. Structured analysis methods use similar techniques but they have seemingly been forgotten (or never learned?) by the OO community where the objects are there 'just for the picking' (to quote Bertrand Meyer). This reviewer now realises that life is not so simple. I have benefited from Jackson's problem frames and have applied them as a 'front-end' to UML in order to structure medium and large systems. In particular, viewing a specific application (such as a home heating system, ATM ...) as an instance of a more general category is very useful as it allows us to gain insights into the current problem. I have specialised the frames to discover domain categories for process control, manufacture, MIS, access control and tracking. This book could trigger a number of developments. For example, discovering and documenting structural and behavioural patterns in this phase of the software development lifecycle could would be a good idea. In particular, looking at requirements as goals instead of jumping directly into the over-hyped use cases seems like a good idea as well. To this end, it might be worth looking at a number of methods that are mentioned in the book, for example KAOS 
 This book clearly presents solid medical advice about stress, blood pressure and weight.  No miracle diets, no junk science, no fads - just time tested information presented in a persuasive way. Topics range from adjusting your attitude to improving your exercise and diet.  This book is a great reference that has helped me control my weight and blood pressure without drugs 
 Mmm, Cookies is a wonderful book!In our class we did an author study.It was a web page, and we put a lot of work into it.The way the story was put was just amazing! The order he put the story. Other books he wrote are very excellent. The boy in the story finds play clay and actually makes cookies out of it. He gives it to his mom! Can you believ that? He actually gave his mom that looks like play dough. My reading buddie especially liked the book. Robert Munsch is a really talented guy along with his illistrator. I recommend this for kids 3-8. a little more desription in the end would have made this book much better 
 It has been said that the best story Jack London ever conceived is the one he lived.  You need look no further than THE CRUISE OF THE SNARK to confirm that.  In this book, all of London's passions come together: action, experience, sailing, foreign travel, writing and reading.  It is a "real adventure" tale, a travelogue and above all a well-crafted book full of London's personal voice and vibrant outlook on life.  One may say it is also full of his ego, but he earns the self-satisfaction by putting action and hard work behind his beliefs and words.  He is fearless.  He is the first to get the irony in a situation and the first to laugh, especially at himself.   In 1908, London and six others, including his wife Charmian, sailed out of the San Francisco Bay into the open waters of the Pacific on what was to be a lengthy circumnavigation of the world.  They were leaving over a year later than originally planned due to hold-ups in the construction of London's "perfect" boat, "The Snark," which ate $30,000 dollars before they left harbor.   It isn't long before leaks, sea-sickness and other banana peels come their way, and it takes 27 days to make Hawaii.  In due course, London learns to surf, they visit the top of a volcano, hang out at a leper colony, and then head further south to the land of Melville's "Typee" and the scary Solomon Islands.  The various captains hired for the trip all seem to lack the navigation gene, so London teaches himself and gets it down to a science.  London, first by necessity and then overtaken by the intoxication of success, becomes a self-taught dentist, and thus his crew's savior and worst nightmare.  He and the crew suffer a nasty list of maladies, as well.  It is a testimony of the man's indefatigable spirit, that even when his own health puts an end to the "round the world" scheme, that he never characterizes the voyage and anything that did not go as planned as a crushing failure or disappointment.  He just heads straight to Plan B.  London's voice is wholly engaging, his profiles of crewmates and people encountered are delightful.  One only wishes that some of his perceptions of other cultures were more enlightened, though they were liberal for their time.  The Penguin Classics critical edition is an excellent balance of original text, a non-spoiling critical introduction, and a selection of 4 other short pieces, including accounts of the voyage by crewmate Martin Johnson and wife Charmian, and two unrelated  maritime essays by London that enrich the overall experience of the book. 
 I bought this book for my 1.5 year old daughter on a lark after she put a pea up her nose.  I figured it would be good for a chuckle, and I was right - it definitely finds humor in nose holes.  The strange part is, it has  become my daughter's top #1 favorite.  I have no idea why - it doesn't have  a plot or any characters, but she just adores it.  Go figure.  I give this  book a strong recommendation not just because it cracks me up, but because  she loves it.  Also, I don't know if it's a coincidence, but she hasn't put  any peas in her nose since 
 This well done book is partly an introduction to teaching/practicing Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)and partly an act of evangelism.  The authors are concerned not only with describing the basic methods of EBM but also with convincing readers that this is the appropriate way to practice and teach clinical medicine.  EBM and its precursor movements are based on the correct realization that physicians tend not to be very critical about clinical practice, much of which is learned by emulation.  This book builds on an existing movement and the presence of widely available online resources to tap into appropriate critical evaluations of clinical practice.  In doing so, the authors attempt to educate physicians about how to use these resources, relatively simple statistical tools that can be incorporated into application of good clinical literature to practice, and how to teach these methods.  Because the authors are academics who wish to influence medical education, there is a good deal of emphasis on educational methods.  While this may be an apparent short coming for readers who are not academics, it is actually worthwhile for all physicians because self-education is a constant part of our job. This book is very well done with some nice features.  It is small and has a durable plastic cover, designed to carried in pockets or in a medical bag, there is a small CD with good examples, and a set of plasticized flash cards on major key points.  Drawbacks are relatively minor.  More information on how to analyze clinical trials and studies would be useful but in a concise book, something has to give way.  Used  carefully, the information in this book may change your practice and teaching methods 
 I loved the book you made. I think Shiloh is an awesome book. Keep writing and I'll keep reading. I love the drama and how marty tries to save shiloh. I cried alittle when Shiloh got hurt by the huge German Sheperd.I think its an emotional terrific book. Shilohs the number 1 book made 
 If you like your films with grit and non-sentimentality, then this film is for you.    The ensemble cast is as good as any group Scorcese or Tarantino have put together.  Only, these actors are from the mean streets of Essex, England.  The highly underrated (by American audiences) Sean Bean (Boromir, Agent 006 and countless other memorable film characters) brings a realism to his psychotic character worthy of DeNiro and Pesci.  (As an aside, Bean also starred alongside DeNiro in an international thriller, Ronin, and more than held his own with the New York City icon).  Alex Kingston (of E.R. fame) brings multiple dimensions to her character as the woman who is controlled by the men in her life and eventually needs to wrest the control for herself.   Tom Wilkinson (of The Full Monty, The Governess and In the Bedroom) adds a touch of crude elegance to his role as a high caliber drug pin.  If you have a hard time with the accents (which can get thick at times) then put on the English subtitles and sit back and enjoy.  There is violence, but not more than most American crime films.  This films has lots of action, but mostly it has good actors working from a good script, which isn't always the case in these kinds of films. 
 If you are interested in this period in history, you should read this book. Shirer offers a day-by-day history of life in Germany during the rise of Nazism and beginning of the war. That alone would be enough for a great book, but there is much more. Shirer covers many aspects of the war; he writes eloquently and accurately about the naivety of pre-war British diplomacy, strategy on both sides, and the Nazi clique. He provides an early glimpse at horrors of Nazi genocide. And his personal story is fascinating, as he travels across Europe, worries about his family, and matches wits with his censors to get as much of the story out as he can. Berlin Diary is very well written and hard to put down. Gems of description abound; for example, he describes a visit to a Lisbon casino: "Tonight, Ed [Murrow] and I did the casino. The gaming rooms were full of a weird assortment of human beings, German and British spies, male and female, wealthy refuges who had mysteriously managed to get a lot of money out and were throwing it about freely, other refugees who were broke and were trying to win their passage money with a few desperate gambles with the fickle roulette wheel..." Highly recommended. 
 This retelling of the SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was actually based on a script that Billy Wilder wrote before immigrating to the United States from Germany, but it was only after the success of the Disney version that a demand was created for it.  The enormously versatile Howard Hawks (quite literally the most versatile director in film history, the only director to have mastered and/or created five or six genres) took the script and turned it into one of the last great pre-WW II comedies.  The story is simple:  a group of monkish scholars living together in New York City are writing an encyclopedia.  One of them is writing about slang, but being unfamiliar with contemporary argot begins research his topic by talking to people outside his normal range of acquaintance.  He runs into gangster moll Sugarpuss O'Shea, who takes advantage of the scholars to move in with them in order to escape the police, who want to talk to her to implicate her guy Joe Lilac.  While hardly Snow White, she certainly managed to stir up their lives.  The film is made wonderful by a number of things:  Wilder's clever script, Hawks typically deft direction, a solid performance by Gary Cooper, but most of all by a scintillating job by the overwhelmingly alluring Barbara Stanwyck and a stellar collection of veteran character actors playing the seven dwarves.  All the latter are great, but special mention has to be made of Richard Haydn (who excells even beside the others, with his extraordinary overpronounciation of everyday words), Oskar Homolka, and S.Z. Sakall.  There are few more delightful collections of character actors in any Hollywood comedy.  I personally prefer Barbara Stanwyck to any other actress in Hollywood history.  She possessed an emotional immediacy that no other actress could approximate, and while her skills were perhaps a tad below those of someone like Katherine Hepburn, the latter never managed to match her fire and passion.  And she is so sexy!  I grew up watching Stanwyck on THE BIG VALLEY, so when I first started seeing her great roles from the thirties, forties, and fifties, I was absolutely stunned at how sexy she could be.  She was attractive, yes, but sexier than she was attractive.  And she was never sexier than she was here, with the exception of her role the same year in THE LADY EVE.  Another reason to see this film is the appearance of Gene Krupa in the early nightclub sequence.  Krupa had, of course, been with Benny Goodman throughout the thirties, so this was very early in his career as leader of his own band.  
 This book does not go into deep details of Cocoa or Xcode but it does what it promises and that is to teach you enough to start building Cocoa programs. And it does that with great quality and makes sure that you understand the concepts that it is teaching. It does not go deep into Objective-C so I highly recomend for those with little C experience to grab a copy of "Programming in Objective-C" by Stephen Kochan. Those 2 books together are easily the most valuable books a programmer beginning Mac OS X programming can own.  The only thing I wished it had more of is to give a little bit more info on how to use various features of Xcode. look to "Beginning Xcode" for that info 
 I bought this DVD because I never get tired of watching Jackie Chan's stunts. He is truly amazing! Paired with Owen, this movie is the perfect comedy! Though the story-line really isn't anything unique, the special stunts and funny dialogue make it special. You can tell these two also had great fun making this movie, and Jackie's performance is always one hundred percent. This viewer truly appreciates all the hard work that goes into the stunt action.

 A reissue of RCA's "This Is..." double-LP from the 1970s, this is perhaps the best-rounded Tommy Dorsey collection yet issued, with equal representation given to Sinatra sides, other featured vocalists, full band numbers, and a few sides by the Clambake Seven. Volume 2 has been reissued as well, and one hopes that RCA will see to the reissue of the rest of the series (Goodman, Shaw, Ellington, Waller, Miller, et al.) 
 ... nevertheless, Kazuo Ishiguro's "Never Let Me Go" was an intriguing read, reeling me in ever so gradually, nearly losing me, never fully snagging me, but throwing me bait of disconcerting revelation just frequently enough to keep me turning pages. By end, I had to admit I had enjoyed reading the book more than, well, than I had realized while reading it.   Which is the kind of odd quality, odd hold, this novel has over the reader. Ishiguro writes in unassuming language. His story seems quite ordinary, initially nothing much more than a coming of age tale, and it runs over 80 pages before I got my first real jolt. Even that,  more of a tug than a jolt. The reader begins to notice something strange going on, little weirdnesses tucked between the everyday routines. Once the reader realizes the scene unfolding is not quite as ordinary as first thought, interest grows.   This is a dark tale of human beings being treated as less than human beings, of human clones grown and nurtured for the sole purpose of harvesting their organs, and their less than humane treatment, even though in appearances humane, based on various societal biases or perhaps only less than clear thinking, or faulty value systems. Indeed, this is Ishiguro's mastery. He has given something very dark, some might say evil, a face so bland it goes almost unnoticed. And, isn't this how evil pervades society every day? Monsters are rarely big and green and warty. Strangers are often your favorite uncle, or the boy next door. The taking down of civilization is not done with a big bang, but with nibbles and bites, a gradual desensitization. Ishiguro's evil is seemingly meek and submissive, as if done for the wellbeing of the masses, and that may arguably be the tactic used most successfully. In novels as well as in life 
 Geoffrey Parker is probably the best military historian active today.  In this book he deploys an astounding amount of research and a brilliant intellect in grappling with a very big historical question: how did the  West, between 1500 and 1800, come to achieve military superiority over  other cultures, even before the invention of steam power, cartridge rifles,  malaria vaccines, etc. etc.   	The first edition of this book won  "best book" prizes from both military history and technological  history societies.  The second edition, which adds a rebuttal to his  critics (for whom see my _The Military Revolution Debate_), is even more  useful 
 Hieromonk Damascene's work unsettles me for several reasons: 1 I'm not sure the "Taoism" it presents matches any form of Taoism, living or extinct. 2 I'm not sure its Christ actually transcends the Western/Orthodox categories which have long impeded the authentic inculturation of Christian thought in a Chinese context. 3 I'm not sure the synthesis presented here really *synthesizes*, really presents the Good News in a Taoist grammar.   That being said, I would still highly commend this book as a thought experiment. Though I stronly question the strengths of it implicit homology--Jewish Scriptures : Gospels :: Tao Te Ching : this project--I do believe it is a vital first step in a journey to restating a Christian message outside of/apart from Western / Orthodox foundational categories. Even though the author has recast traditional Christianity into a quasi-Taoist vocabulary, there are striking moments in the text. These flashes in the pan come often enough to warrant attentive reading. Few have done better explaining Jesus' regard for the lowly as reflecting something intrinsic God's mission to the world. Even fewer have spoken clearly of the absolute necessity of the interior life to living a genuine Christian life.   I would say: Read this book. Enjoy it. Don't think this is a true Taoist Christianity, but allow the Hieromonk's quirky ideas enter the conversation with Martin Palmer's The Jesus Sutras & Chad Hansen's A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought and you may come up with something truly synthetic 
 I had never read financial thriller.  I really enjoyed this book.  It helped that I had an accountant friend explain what was real and fantasy.  The fantasy was just to keep the story going and I understand why authors need this.  The real taught me things that I didn't realize that people could or would do for money.  To me it was a facinating and interesting book 
 I highly recommend this book to gain greater insights in the Music business or any business. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit 
 Amon Tobin is simply a genius. I've said it before, and I will say it again: he is a genius. Right before he left the planet to create alien symphonies from the Virgo Complex, he left us this final album that sounds like it came from the Earth's soil after having been buried by an alien race who visited us millions of years ago with vastly superior technology to what we'll ever have. If that doesn't give you an indication of what this album sounds like, only listening to it ever will. The only misstep is possibly "Precursor" featuring the fire-breathing mouth percussion of Quadriceptor. Aside from that, this album is just out of the world. Trust me, once you hear it, music will never sound the same for you. Ever. Glorious 
    Here's the thing--I have been in high-end straight commission selling for a long time. I have seen sales people come and go in my industry. Those sales people who survive end up figuring out and using the Sandler strategies intuitively, even if they never heard of Sandler. These salespeople figure out that they better find out pretty quick if they've got a viable prospect or not, instead of being a walking brochure and giving presentations and dog and pony shows to anybody who will listen.    Sandler was a genius sales trainer because he told it the way it is for the day-to-day salesperson. Case in point--before I ever heard of Sandler, I had already made enought sales to realize that the best prosepct was a prospect with "pain."  My first sales manager years ago used to ask me, "Where's the pain" when I told him I had a hot prospect. "Find the pain, find the pain," he used to say.     I often wondered why the traditional sales/motivational gurus(you know, the giants at NightingaleConant company) never talked about "pain." Oh, sure. They talked about a prospects "need". But they never took it further than that.These gurus never talked about getting the prospects nitty-gritty "pain".    (Alot of sales gurus tout "Spin Selling." Like that is some new revelation in selling. Give me a break.Salespeople in my industry call "Spin Selling"--"Sandler lite" because that's what it is. "Spin selling" is taking Sandler and making it agreeable to the mass of sales people out there.)     Anyway, I think I've said enough. Except that learning the Sandler Selling System will change your sales life. You'll be happier, have more self-esteem, have more control of the sales call, and most importantly, you'll go to the bank more often!!      
 I'm a preaching pastor who tries to work from the Greek text. I've read and marked up most of my Stott copy on Romans.  It is in my top five commentaries on Romans and I use it a lot.  However, I have to disagree with the other two reviews on this book.   Some positives on this book include:   Instead of giving the typical break at 1:15 & 1:16, like most commentators, Stott explains it like this:  Vs 14    I am bound Vs 15    I am eager Vs 16    I am not ashamed  (1:16 & 17 state the theme of Romans, but Stott splits 16 off and matches it to the end of the previous paragraph.  This fresh view makes one think.  I believe that is one of Stott's great assets). So he is unique and has some really good things to say. It's worth reading. It is great for preaching ideas.  However, many times he gives a view that flows from one perspective of theology on a verse, with no hint or cue that there are other views that may differ from him. Sometimes his perspective is not really taken seriously by contemporary scholars-yet Stott fails to even mention there are opposing views.  So he can have a bit of eisegetical theology mixed into his exegesis.  For this reason, I totally disagree with the reviewer who said something like if you could only own one commentary on Romans that this was the one to get.  It probably should be number three or four in a list of priorities-not number one, at least for exegetical work.  Specifics:  At one point he brings Calvinistic terminology into a simple use of the term law, attempting to suggest an exegetically exotic view.  More careful commentaries, like Moo on Romans reject his approach as difficult to support.  Another example is his effort on Romans 6 to say that the power of sin is not included in what Paul is talking about.  Stott insists that it is the guilt of sin only that Paul is covering in 6:1-14.  There is no contextual factor to warrant that conclusion.  Again, more thorough and careful evangelical works on that section do not agree with his assessment.  (Stott is this way in his Ephesians commentary as well).  So how I use Stott is for a fresh look at the text and great phrases that preach well.  As far as exegetical accuracy, I would lean towards Moo and Edwards on Romans.  So I recommend Stott on Romans, but not for every paragraph-and not as the main commentary one owns for serious work in the Greek text.  For that, one cannot be without the NICNT by Moo-which is far more complete and careful in its analysis.  So if you can afford to get Stott, add him to your collection and compare what he says to other guys like Edwards Moo, Kasemann, etc....He's got a great way of phrasing things and I've used his phrasing in sermon outlines more than once 
 What a wonderful view of the southern world. Told with insight and compassion, this a a story book clubs would enjoy 
 I think An Unfinished Life is one of the few movies that both Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman have made that came on in the theaters one weekend and then disappeared two weeks later.  Though a predictable movie, An Unfinished Life is still a very good film with excellent performances by Redford, Freeman, Jennifer Lopez, Josh Lucas, and Becca Gardiner.    The story starts out with Lopez and her teenage daughter, Gardiner, leaving an abusive relationship with hardly any money and a broken-down car.  When the car finally reaches its last leg, Lopez has no choice but to head to Wyoming and a father-in-law (played by Redford) who blames her for the death of his only son.  When Lopez reaches Redford's ranch, it turns out the neither he, nor her daughter, knew of each other.  The fact that he's suddenly a grandfather, however, doesn't stop Redford from telling his daughter-in-law that he doesn't want her there and to leave.  Of course, there wouldn't be much of a story if that happened.  Later, when Redford sees Lopez and Gardiner in town, he has a change of heart and tells them that they're welcome to stay at his place if they want.  The two females move in with Redford and his long-time ranch hand and close friend (played by Freeman).  Freeman's character was mauled by a grizzly bear and is now somewhat of a cripple.  He stays in the small house adjacent to the main quarters.  As it turns out, Freeman is also Redford's conscious.  He doesn't hesitate to tell Redford that he's wrong about blaming Lopez for his son's death in a car accident and that he needs to get to know his granddaughter.  Through trials and tribulations, Redford and the two females slowly start to become close to each other.  As this is happening, Lopez develops a relationship with the town's sheriff (played by Josh Lucas).  At first Redford feels that Lopez is being unfaithful to the memory of his son, but gradually relents due to the good nature of the sheriff.  Then, during the last third of the movie, Lopez' abusive boyfriend tracks her down and is intent on having her leave with him.  That's when all hell breaks lose and we find out just how tough Redford's character really is.   What makes An Unfinished Life truly shine is the interaction between Redford's character and Freeman's.  These two men have a strong friendship that knows no bounds.  This is displayed most effectively in how Redford takes care of his crippled friend by helping him to get around, making his meals, playing cards with him, and eventually following his advice about everything.  I don't think Redford and Freeman have ever been better than they are in this film.  I have to say, however, that Redford really looks his age.  Though this movie won't win any awards, it's still a pure pleasure to watch.  It's also nice having Jennifer Lopez back after a long absence.  She handles her character perfectly as someone who's filled with guilt and tortures herself for it day in and day out.  The theme of this film is certainly one about our need for forgiveness and to feel whole again.  That's an important message for everyone.  The extras on the DVD have a director's commentary and a making-of featurette and a look at the training of Bart the Bear, who plays a large role in the movie.  
 I've used this book teaching 10 classes in Multicultural Education for California State University at Hayward.  It covers some "hot spots" like gender, special education, race, and social class.  I've  never had a student who expressed dislike for the book.  It provokes  dissent, emotions, and great discussions but maintains a well researched  and professional style.  I would recommend it to any professor of  multicultural education and I eagerly await the 4th edition, coming this  July 
 I've had the Clarisonic brush for one year now and I love it.  My skin feels really clean and looks very smooth.  Because of the price tag I haven't given any as gifts, but I recommend it to everyone.  Customer service has been great the two times I contacted them.  First because my skin broke out the first week I used it.  They offered to take it back, but I persevered and have not had a break out since.  I also thought the brush had stopped holding a charge, and customer service gave me a number to call, but I was mistaken so I never did make the call. I highly recommend this brush 
 I've been exclusively wet shaving for several months, using a Merkur Trac II style razor.  Having decided to take the plunge to a DE safety razor, I ordered the Merkur Futur Adjustable.  For my initial shave I set it on "1" (least aggressive), and got an absolutely wonderful shave, with no nicks, razor burn, or any discomfort at all.  Even around my jaw line and the point of my chin (notoriously touchy areas) there were no problems whatsoever.  At fifty cents a blade this is a wonderfully economical way to shave after the initial investment in the razor, which barring earthquake, fire, or apocalypse should last a lifetime

 Perhaps it's political intrigue which interests; if so, Vince Flynn's CONSENT TO KILL is now in paperback and provides a thriller based on modern headlines and terrorist concerns. Mitch becomes the target of an international conspiracy for his struggles to preserve freedom: CONSENT TO KILL shows his evolution from hunter to prey as he's stalked by dangerous, unseen forces for his past 'crimes'. An outstanding and engrossing leisure choice 
 TRACK OF THE CAT is an outstanding Western that focuses on fear of the unknown and the psychological effects of fear.  "Wild Bill" Wellman once again comes through with another classic that has gone unrecognized. TRACK OF THE CAT's highly stylistic visual cinematography including stunning location photography and claustrophobic indoor photography that juxtaposes feelings of security and insecurity suggesting that man must find a balance to his environment in order to survive in it.  Both Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter give uncharacteristic performances. This is probably one of Tab Hunter's best performances in a motion picture.  
 The first thing this book strikes me so much is how frank and to certain extent self-criticising the author is on his life from a doctoral student in the Physics Department of Columbia Univ., to a post-doc scholar, to Bell Labs, then to the Wall Street.  Among a good number of books allegedly about lives on the Street, this one with its plain-speaking, matter-of-fact narration definitely offers me a refreshing sensation.  For example, the author states flat on how he rode down continuously descending expectations in career from an enthusiastic Ph.D. student who had dreams of groundbreaking discoveries in theoretical physics down to a junior professor in a public college running between jobs to an unremarkable researcher at Bell Labs.  The author lays out lucid descriptions about the works with financial models he had done.  Yet unlike most others on similar topics, he goes on to explain to the readers what inadequacies/weaknesses those models have.  A few personal friends of mine came through their doctoral degrees in physics around the same era before quants became ubiquitous on the Street.  To a good sense I can relate how all their lives shared the similar paths of seeing their zests of a career in science being depressed by the harsh reality of seeking a stable teaching/research job after the migrant post-doc years.  The author presents to us his own path in a most poetic way 
 After one hour my teeth were much whiter with no sensitivity. After hour two I had a swollen upper lip that lasted 24 hours approx. and it was a little sour. It was kinda like a hive, so I give this 5 stars because I loved it. I am impatient and wanted results fast. However next time I use it, which I will. . . I am going to do the first one, one day and the second hour the next day. :)Very white teeth. Very happy now my lip is normal, and that took about 24 hours. lol. 
 This is just as solid as his first and then them.B-legit is showing the world that the Clicks sucsess was no fluke and how bright the future for him and the sickwitit family really is...From E-40 and the Click to the  Mossie this is the team thats been here since 92 and I don't see that  changin any time soon....(I was at Philly Blunts studio in Vallejo back in  September of 98 and a heard a new B-legit song that was recorded for his  new album and it was off the hook..I hope it makes the album.....)Watch 4  the new album cuz he keeps gettin better....

 There are very few books on specific artist methods and materials that I would call extraordinary, and fewer still I would consider definitive. This book is both. The photographic illustrations, including some amazing close-ups, are fantastic, and the text, though at times quite technical, is engrossing. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date reference on Rembrandt's painting materials and techniques you're likely to find for a long time to come. If you only own one book on Rembrandt, it should be this one 
 Finally a book that dispenses with all the fabricated and wildly unproven Templar theories. This book is mainly, however, about the early Sinclair/Zeno trip(s) to America before Columbus. They did have Templar connections. One of the highlights of this book is the discussion on the Newport Tower in Rhode Island. There can be no doubt this predates Columbus. It's time for serious archaeological study of this structure. The only place that the authors get off topic is in chapter 12 where they try to be philosophical and make you feel bad about the America Indians. Sorry, but the population drop of the Indians wasn't "primarily due to genocide." The majority had died from disease between the initial European contacts and large scale colonization. I'm not saying they weren't persecuted, but they weren't as peace loving as the authors trying to make them out either. But the authors do make a good point about the natives not forgetting and ignoring nature around them. In any case, this book is a solid look at early American explorations 
 A very quick reading book , but by far one of the funniest I read. It's a book for all grandmothers everywhere and when the grandmothers are finished pass on to your daughters who will also enjoy the read. It hit home in so many ways, with truths that moms and daughters everywhere share as they grow up together. Just an enjoyable hour well spent reading why I love being a grandmother (well really a grandjoy) I knew before I read this book what my role as a grandmother was but this little book proved it 
 Jamie Lee Curtis and Peter Gallagher are excellent in this forgotten thriller about a divorced mother and father who fight over the right to see their two boys.  Jamie Lee Curtis plays the mother who comes back into the boys lives after three yrs away and tries to get them back and destroy her exhusbands new life with his girlfriend.  Jamie Lee is pretty good at being crazy in this flick and it is surely one of her best acting roles.  The movie has numerous chilling momments that are brillantly filmed.  Crystal clear picture makes for an enjoyable movie for all B movie thriller fans.  Get this movie ASAP!  It probably is not available to rent anymore so pick up a cheap used one like I did--you will not regret it!  Enjoy!!!! 
 Having formally studied Spanish, French, and German before undertaking a self-study of Japanese, I know what I like in a language text, and this is it.  The author presents concepts in a logical manner with good explanations.  He also transitions the student from romaji to the kana (and kanji) at a reasonable pace.  I've been cramming this book at the somewhat harried rate of one chapter per week in preparation for a trip to Japan.  Each chapter requires about 10-12 hours of study.  I'd recommend ten days to two weeks per chapter to allow time for side-study of conversation (eg. with CDs such as Pimsleur) and writing (kana and kanji).  At this pace, you could complete the book in about a year.  My only complaint (other than the oft-mentioned lack of audio tapes) is that the author introduces vocabulary in a questionalbe order.  Many words of limited use are introduced before more common words.  Additionally, the author often will use a word in an example before or without introducing it, but thankfully it's always in the short dictionary at the end of the book.  Hopefully, as I form a better foundation of vocabulary, these issues will cease to matter. 
 This is a wonderful book.  It is unclear from the title, but the content of the book came as retreats for University students in Poland given by John Paul II when he was bishop (and cardinal) in Cracow.  The talks are so down to earth and personal.  I love theology also, but the simple message to everyday students really touches the heart more profoundly.   A particular strong point is the two short chapters given to female, then male students.  The way John Paul II upholds the dignity of women is amazing.  The way he tells young men from scripture that our problems are summed up as: "male arrogance, scant willingness to give, and the spirit of conquest," shows how he hits home in a concrete way.  He also addresses abortion and the man's role in abortion with no compromise.  The whole book is hard hitting and direct 
 In reading this book, I've found simple to use, clearly explained examples of how to bring clients tremendous value in a short period of time.  The material is presented in a manner that is easily absorbed and readily implemented, even by those new to coaching.  It gave me the reinforcement I was looking for when I was struggling with dealing with difficult clients.  I periodically refer back to the book when I have a client in an industry that I'm not familar with and it brings me back to the basics 
 The whistle of this tea kettle brings the herd to the kitchen in a hurry - The delightful design brightens up the kitchen, great capacity and pours without spilling. The delivery service was very fast.  
 Sue Grafton has created the best female detective--bar none!  Kinsey's cases are realistic, and she is so real that you find yourself looking for her on the street.  There is no higher praise for an author.   
 I thought this novel was great - I had previously read Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon," which was amazing, so I had high expectations. They were, for the most part, met.  However, I found the "Librarian" to be somewhat of a trope - it seemed as if Stephenson had difficulty linking the diverse strands of his plot (Metaverse, "reality," and Sumerian myth) together and had to employ a long-winded virtual program as somewhat of a stand-in to tie some of the more esoteric Sumerian threads into the entire plot. Forgiveable in a first novel, but set in relation to the whole (and the standard set by his later work) I was a little disappointed.  Regardless, still highly recommended 
 I bought this CD for my niece and her husband on the arrival of their new baby girl in February. As a smooth jazz fan myself, I knew the artists playing on Golden Slumbers were fantastic and their lullabies would help soothe the most fractious of babies! I was right... apparently, it worked a treat!

 Mark Jarman's new book is a brilliant continuation of the themes for which he is so admired. Is there a poet writing today with a more keenly developed, complex spirituality? These are poems our culture needs, perhaps now more than ever. They are so readable, so thought provoking, so memorable. Treat yourself and your friends to this volume 
 i think this book is one of the best art books available on the market. Every section is divided by the artist and it's explained in a very complete way and very simple to understand at the same time...a real dilight to your mind and a strong pleasure to the eye!! 
 Even for a non-Yogi...or someone who has never taken Yoga before, this film is very informative and goes into the history of where Yoga comes from...And India is beautiful, so are the people there...I was very impressed and it's not even really my genre, but now I want to see more.. 
 I know the kids in the youth group at my church raved about this album probably as much as our parents raved about "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" in the Summer of Love in 1967. It was a good follow-up to "Jesus Freak", but I could sense that something was amiss in this album. I feel that alot of it had to be with the fact that all the band members were in their 30's, and probably yearning something more from God than what was the blessings they were recieving already. I feel that was I got out of it; I was into my 30's, and soon enough I'll be in my 40's. I found that this was the end of Contemporary Christian music as I knew it; I started seeing the writing on the wall when the Insyderz released the album "Skallellujah" that same year of 1998, and began everyone on the wagon of doing nothing but praise and worship songs for albums. I do have a couple of favorites like "Since I Met You", and "Consume Me", but then there were some like "Godsend", and "Into Jesus" that left me very melancholy. I know part of why "Into Jesus" left me that way was the fact that "What Have We Become" got considerable airplay around the time "Into Jesus" was released as the first single. I know that the group broke up on good terms, and that's wonderful, and I pray that their spiritual lives are for the better, but it's taken me 7 years to finally say that this album was like a goodbye to me as well. I know that the music scene isn't as fertile as it was almost 10 years ago, but I have to remember that it's all about Jesus, and not a music style, or music trend, and remember to not knock a certain genre because it sounds old and tired, but appreciate any good songs mixed in. 
   For those who come to Heinlein's epic Starship Troopers after having seen the movie of the late 1990's, expect to find a novel as rich in thoughtfulness as the film is filled with mindlessness.  Starship Troopers is an exploration of societal values and the role of the free-willed individual within society.  I find the science fiction aspect is largely incidental to the crux of the story.  The fact that there is a war on with the Arachnids provides some action sequences and a sense of urgency for the plot; however, what really matters in this story is what Heinlein's characters say about the society in which they live and what they say about human behavior.  Some have argued that this story is anti-democratic or even pro-authoritarian.  In the world of Starship Troopers, the right to vote belongs only to citizens.  Few of the people of this world are citizens, however.  Only those who serve in the military become citizens and thus gain the right to vote.  Thus political power only belongs to those who are willing to serve their society and place themselves in harm's way for it.  Heinlein's argument thus is that the brightest humans are not the ones who are the most fit to make decisions for humanity.  Only those who are willing to fight for a society should run it.  Heinlein goes further and outlines the failure of democracy.  His characters discuss the difference between the natural rights of democracy and the earned rights of the citizens of Starship Troopers.  The people of democracy learned to obsess over their rights and ignored their responsibilities.  Heinlein's political construct forces those with rights to acknowledge their responsibilities by granting key rights (the right to vote) only to those who have placed their lives on the line for the society.  Whether one agrees or not, Heinlein makes a very good argument for the virtue of this kind of arrangement.  Heinlein also illustrates infantry training in a military that wants to wash people out instead of getting as many as possible through the system.  As an infantryman recently returned from war (which is where I read Starship Troopers), I can say that I would not care to go through the course of training Heinlein shows the reader.  However, I'd prefer to see something more like what Heinlein shows us that the system we have today.  A higher attrition rate in basic training would ensure a better product for the Army of the real world.  The characters are smart.  They are thinkers.  This is one of the aspects I like most about the story because it's how I'd like to see the military.  The military shouldn't be masses of ill-cultured, unreflective knuckleheads, which is so often the case in line units of the Army.  Soldiers should be smart and tough.  The leaders should be even more so.  Heinlein shows us the advantage of a small, all-volunteer force made up of people who are truly devoted to service to their society by making the characters who lead the protagonist into perceptive, capable individuals.    A few aspects of Heinlein's infantry are rather silly.  For instance, there are no dedicated staffers.  All staff officers do their staff job and fight.  There are no separate maintenance people in the unit.  While this does mean the infantry unit is completely composed of "trigger-pullers", it means that someone who is not part of the unit has to do the maintenance on the equipment, provide service support, and so on.  There's no conceivable alternative if all the infantry are training and fighting.  There are other unrealistic ideas like this one; but overall these aspects detract little from an otherwise splendid treatise on how the infantry should be run.  As a work of science fiction, Heinlein's Starship Troopers is excellent specifically because the story is fantastic without the science fiction setting.  The story is about politics and human nature.  Whether one agrees with Heinlein's position or not, his propositions are well worth reading.     
 A perfect Bob Marley collection, such an awesome CD to listen to on these nice summer days. There aren't too many songs I can think of that were forgotten, this is a much better CD than Legends or any other Bob Marley collection. This is the one you want 
 funny how a group who doesn't get much love sure has played a major part on the landscape of songs.many of there songs have been remade by everybody from madonna to mary j bliege. and sampled like crazy.harmonys,the funky  grooves,and pop hooks are all here.the name did them justice cuz they are a  class act period 
 The six stories collected in "The Piazza Tales" range vastly in theme and subject, from the allegorical travelogue of "The Encantadas" to the haunting psychodrama of "Bartleby, the Scrivener." With the exception of the title story (which was original to the collection), they each were published in "Putnam's Magazine," where they were well received and widely read. Although the book (like all of Meville's later work) was a commercial flop, the stories are highly regarded--and rarely read--today.  Opening the volume is "The Piazza," a charming (bordering on precious) pastoral sketch that frames the collection in much the same way that Hawthorne and Irving framed their collections with a stroll around the Manse or a view of Bracebridge Hall. It provides an almost romantic and (for Melville) rare excursion into "fairy-land" in the daylight of the countryside surrounding his home, but at the close of the story the author warns us that "truth comes in darkness."  The best of the five remaining pieces is, surely, "Bartleby, the Scrivener" (possibly my favorite story written in English); it is the most Kafkaesque story not written by Kafka. The narrator, a Wall Street lawyer whose office resembles a claustrophobic dungeon, hires Bartleby, a supremely competent copyist who subverts the safe order and hierarchy of the firm when he replies "I would prefer not to" when requested to execute tasks he'd rather not perform. From the first act of rebellion to the end of the story, the atmosphere resembles Poe as much as it anticipates Kafka; its bleak views of the market, of madness, and of municipal estrangement are unsettling.  The other stories vary in quality. The wickedly subversive satire of "Benito Cerenno" is based on a true incident in which a transport of slaves overtook their captors; Melville revises the original narrative to condemn the covert racism of the narrator, a "Massachusetts man" who captains the ship that encounters the mutineers and whose liberal, patronizing opinion of the Africans is so unnuanced that he is unable to recognize that a rebellion has occurred. To modern readers, it all seems ridiculously unbelievable and, while remarkably ahead of its time, Melville's version of the episode sometimes suffers from attitudes and stereotypes which have themselves become unfashionable and uncomfortable.  Interesting and clever, "The Lightning-Rod Man" and "The Bell Tower," are ultimately unmemorable, but the only tale that doesn't work for me at all is "The Encantadas," a series of ten travel sketches based on Melville's trip to the Galapagos Islands. Rather than presenting a literary version of Darwin's earlier travels, Melville emulates Dante, presenting an allegorical vision of purgatory on earth, of "cut-throats" and "tyrants" and "cannibals" amidst the dichotomy of the landscape's unforgiving harshness and overwhelming beauty. Of the pieces in the collection, these ten sketches received the most critical attention during Melville's lifetime, and they are still considered masterpieces by academics. There are inarguably brilliant passages and poetic descriptions, but the allegory seems labored and the "tale" as a whole pales in comparison to either Darwin or Dante 
 As a single guy in a medium sized city I was able to learn a lot of different tips and tricks about how to trade up and down for the present and the future. I also learned a lot about how habits I already have are influenced by the Treasure Hunt. [...] It made a great conversation piece with friends about how they unknowingly trade up or down in different aspects of their lives. I recommend it to anyone interested in marketing or business management both as a professional tool or a leisure reading experience 
 I think this author has an amazing ability to weave a complicated and multi-layered story together in the most interesting way...he keeps you guessing to the very end.  I think Blood Memory is one of my all-time favorite books, and The Quiet Game is a superb follow-up 
 This is by far the best reference book in print for Catholics.  This book explains Catholic Doctrine according to Scripture and is easy to understand.  Jacki 
 My husband loves these shoes, and they look great!  They do run about a half size small, so I'd recommend trying some on before ordering 
 This is one of the most important book you will ever have as an occupational therapist. It's the only book you would need to get through the OTR(Occupational Therapy Registration) exam 
 I am writing this review on oct 9 1998 exactly one year since Michael  Krasnow died of anorexia nervosa.  This book was excellent because it took  all of the "glamour" out of eating disorders.  So many people  think that it is a "cool"  disease.  This book adequately shows  what hell an eating disorder is and just how very difficult it is to beat  an eating disorder. This book is also excellent because it is one of the  few books deling with males and eating disorders.I would recommend this  book to everyone 
 This is party music, pure and simple. Buster Poindexter's laughing,  growling baritone gets the joint jumping with "Hot, Hot, Hot,"  "Cannibal," and other songs that'll wake up the crowd.  First  time I heard this album, I was impressed with Buster's choice of  repertoire. He puts a new and refreshing spin on older tunes: the  blues-belting "Bad Boy," the restrained "Oh Me Oh My,"  and the impassioned "House of the Rising Sun" and "Heart of  Gold." There's also some comedy-novelty material, and Buster really  sells it: "Good Morning Judge," a big-band blast with loudmouth  Buster in hot water with the law; "Screwy Music," which is just  what the title implies; and "Whadaya Want," a call-and-response  tune with Buster and chorus. Everyone's having a good time here, and the  fun is contagious 
 My wife wanted me to become more active and knowing my desire to buy another electronic gadget, she suggested we look at geocaching. I had never heard of this activity before but since it meant getting a GPS unit, I figured "what the heck". Before making my purchase, I needed to know what to look for so i needed more information on the sport of geocaching. This book was the most informative book I found and was easy to read and hard to put down. I found the information extremely useful. And, yes, we have gone geocaching and have found our first 3 caches. Without the knowledge gained from reading this tome, I would still be out in the woods looking for my way home 
 This is an excellent book to read to a baby. My son has loved this book so much we read it to him at least twice a day. One thing I love about this book is that it's so simple and caughts the baby's attention. 
 I have given this book a 4 star rating as a geek friend who helped me set up my business server read it and said it was pretty good. I am an experienced applications programmer with substantial knowledge of networks and the practicalities of server services. I incorrectly thought this book would almost be like a step-by-step for setting up your own server. The description is correct, each chapter does explain in brief detail what that feature is and then goes into detail of how to set it up. HOWEVER at no point does it explain why you would need the feature or what the acronyms used mean or what is achieved after you add that feature. Personally if you already know about servers, understand the terminology and acronyms and have set up many servers before then my geek friend advises this is a great book. If you are a geek but know little about server terminology and are looking for a step by step book on how to set up a server starting with Server 2003 forget it. If you are not a geek you will be unable to read this book at all, it lost me after only a few paragraphs on every chapter. I gave this book away to my friend 
 I read this book for a book review I had to do for a history of Islam course. Altogether, it was a great book, though probably not for the "average" reader. Esposito is a scholar, thus he writes like one. Anyone who hasn't already gotten a few academic books under their belt might find a few of his more complex concepts a bit difficult to follow. He goes into great detail, but also assumes a lot of knowledge on the part of the reader. Nevertheless, the points presented in the book are important for everyone to understand. As Esposito says, if you TRULY want to understand Islam and modern Muslims, you MUST be willing to delve into the complexities of history. It may be hard work, but if you want to know the truth behind the stereotypes, you have to be willing to learn a lot 
 This series is the epitome of smooth, elegant, sexy deep house. Should be listened to with the lights down low and the volume up high 
 Sidney Poitier is one of my favorite actors and he links up nicely with Abby Lincoln. A very cute love story 
 I have to start my review by saying it's written on the premise that this is a fictional tale.  This is real history mixed in with fictional history (Berry gives an explanation at the end between the fact and fiction used in the book).  I also loved the DaVinci Code, which is also some fact/some fiction, and when reading it in that context, it too was fabulous, just like this book.  This was a great read and a great story.  I am a fan of the classics and I just found the whole idea of actually having the texts of the Library of Alexandria still around fascinating.  I think Berry did a great job of laying out how the scrolls would be kept and the importance they would have to the rest of the world.    Berry write exciting, fast-paced and fun-to-read books and I would definitely recommend this one!  Read it in the spirit of the book it is - a great adventure with espionage and mystery mixed in 
 This is a fine compilation of Mark's hits from 1990-1996. His biggest hits are here, although a few  are left off. What is here is some of the best music played on mainstream country radio during the early 1990s. What sets Mark's music apart from that of his contemporaries is his excellent voice and his willingness to keep the music a bit more "country" and a bit less pop than most of his peers.    I can't give this CD 5 stars, though, because it is missing too many of Mark's hits. Chesnutt had 20 top ten hits throughout his career. This CD has only 12 tracks. So -- what is here is excellent, but this CD is missing a good bit. 
 Bought it unheard when recommended by the dude at the bookstore and really really have enjoyed it.  Yeah, it's pretty much pop, but with a smart twist.  
 "Neither of the Grimes sisters would have a happy life ..."  With that opening sentence, Yates sums up the entire story and then spends the rest of the novel showing us why the Grimes sisters were unhappy, and also spares the reader any false hopes of a "happily ever after" tale.   The story of two sisters and their diverging paths in life is not an idea that was unique to Yates;  fairy tales, Victorian novels, and twentieth-century soap operas (most notably "Love of Life" and the soap opera parody, "Soap") utilize this device.  Often one sister would be the "good" one (virtuous, dedicated, mother) and the other would be the "bad" one (promiscuous, single, needy) but Yates is too smart to go for the conventional.  "Easter Parade" inverts this cliche and shows how the "good" and "bad" lives are not always as they seem.  Sure, Sarah gets married and has children, but at what cost?  Emily is a single woman on her own in the big city at the wrong time, but does the reader really think her life is as hopeless as Sarah's? I sure didn't.    "Easter Parade" truly belongs to Emily.  We see flashes of a feminist consciousness in the essays she writes I spent the entire novel thinking had Emily been around a few decades later, she may have appreciated her unfettered existence much more and landed not in this novel but in Marilyn French's "The Women's Room".    This novel is a good, and very fast read, and while I didn't enjoy it quite as much as "Revolutionary Road", it made me ponder its message much more than I did over "Road". I'd give "Road" an A+ and "Parade" an A-. 
 I find Professor Gilmore's book a top-flight exposition of a "not so easy" subject.  As a mathematician, I am very comfortable with the degree of mathematical rigor.  It is not sloppy.  I hope physicists won't be put off by the fact that this book is written in "mathematics."  We are in a time when the distinction between pure mathematics and theoretical physics is rapidly blurring, if not already extinct.  The physicist must become accustomed to the protocal of pure mathematics, as the mathematician must understand the needs of theoretical physics and be motivated by them.  Many will disagree.  As a Ph.D candidate in mathematics a "few" years ago, on creating a proof (hopefully elegant), I used to joke with my major professor about what a disaster it would be if the physicists at our university found some way to put our reselt to practical use. Imagine the horror of our lemma on ideal theory in a C* Algebra being so desecrated.  Oh, the shame!  Now I say "a pox on such elitism and snobbery."  The work under discussion is very well motivated (the preface is an excellent historical summary of how this mathematics became so necessary for progress in physics, and how theoretical physics has motivated mathematical research.  The copious "no frills" illustrations are particularly valuable to the reader, particularly if she is not accustomed to just accepting chains of head-to-tail syllogisms as sufficient.    Two thumbs up!  
 I was totally engulfed in "INQUISITION".  The brilliant command of the English language, vivid descriptions, in-depth character development, attention to the minutest detail, and the geographical scope, are overwhelming. It spans the rich industrial life of the Lehigh Valley, and the sophisticated political manueverings of Washington DC, during a profoundly  complicated era. Only someone who has conquered these areas could present this revealing insight into the soul of Congressman Zachary Taylor Harris. I thoroughly enjoyed it; was devoured by it. "INQUISITION" is the kind of book you won't want to put down 
 This was one of my favorite books as a child and my mother has fond memories of reading it to me. I recently rediscovered it as a book to read my own toddler and I have learned that most people have not heard of it. That's a shame. The illustrations are wonderful and the story is great fun. A little boy is invited to various meals by a doting king and queen and, contrary to all rules of etiquette, asks if he can bring a guest, who always turns out to be some more or less untidy zoo animal. The combination of royalty and wild animals makes this a perfect storm for my child. The text has wonderful rhymes, with lots of clever enjambment, and it reads quite musically. I hope more people discover this lost classic 
 I have not read the entire book, but have read several pages throughout the book.  It is not exactly what I was told by a friend that it would be, however, it is a very interesting, educational book 
 This was the research tool I needed. It was suggested by Chuck Missler as necessary reading for anyone looking to do serious Prophetic Bible study 
 Works pefectly well. Computer text, windows, etc. will always be flickering and/or blured on normal TV set 
 All you have to do to count yourself as John Mcdermott's kindred spirit is love your family, friends, nation, and timeless stories.  John sings few "new" songs; he's far too busy making us cry with "The Old Man," "Crazy Mary," "Danny Boy," and the War Medley. We also get to go traveling with him to Skye ("The Skye Boat Song"), Cape Breton ("Song of the Mira") and meet new friends like Alison Girvan, whose lovely voice is featured with John's in "Here You Are." The "Battle Hymn of the Republic" could not be more effectively sung than it is performed here, perhaps because John acknowledged that he was thinking of heroes as he sang it.  None of John's fans have to be encouraged to buy this cd; we wait for each one to arrive so we can immediately purchase copies for ourselves, our families, and friends.  If you're not a fan, just listen.  You'll learn to love him and his music, too 
   I bought this book for my nieces, but as with everything, read it first. On the surface the basic story is a good fantasy tale. Below the surface is an intricate and subtlly layered story that leaves you thinking about the characters long after the book is closed. And in my opinion THIS is what makes a good tale. I want to give a growing mind food for thought and I think this book is it 
 In Greenwich, Connecticut, Melanie Travis is a special needs tutor at the posh private Howard Academy.  She enjoys her work there, but her passion is showing and breeding French Poodles.  Her son Davy enthusiastically helps her with the canines when he can.  When she takes her son to the school bus, Melanie is surprised that Henry the long time driver has been replaced by Annie.  She visits Henry to see if he is okay only to learn that he recently died from a heart attack.  Melanie sees Golden Retrievers inside of Henry's home so feeling compassion and not wanting the dogs to mourn alone, she takes them to her Aunt Peg, a professional breeder and canine lover.  The two female relatives learn through the grapevine that Henry was poisoned.  His two daughters arrive planning to sell their father's animal companions on E-bay.  They also refuse to leave town until their father's killer is caught.  Peg wants these coldhearted adult children be gone so she investigates the homicide to expedite their departure, not realizing the danger her decision poses to her and her niece.  JINGLE BELL BARK is a delightful tale that amateur sleuth fans will enjoy especially the canine caper crowd.  Laurien Berenson enables readers to glimpse inside the world of dogs through the loving way aunt and niece nurture their beloved barking family members.  The audience, like Peg, will find it impossible to determine who the killer is because suspects abound with motives and opportunities.  This leads to a surprising climax as Peg and Melanie try to take a bite out of crime before they are nipped permanently.  Harriet Klausner 
 I missed the chance to read this in college, but enjoyed it greatly now (in middle age). Eliot is so intelligent and insightful about how adults make choices with unintended consequences. Everyone considering marriage should read this book. The setting may be out of date but her understanding of the human heart is timeless 
 Kindergarten Anniversary Edition is everything the original was and more! Fulghum knows how to look at life from a different perspective with a touch of hope and a delightful keen eye. I loved every minute of it! 
 Wonderful help and encouragement to an empty broken heart. Just knowing others feel the same who have experienced such loss 
 This is a terific album, very typical of Mulligan's work at the time. It also features great playing by Art Farmer, making his recent death even more sad. Both confirmed Mulligan fans and beginners will enjoy this 
 I pull this book out every time I start a new project.  It offers great blocks with 5 different size options.  That was the sell for me, math is not my thing!  I've owned this book for years and I still love it.  I have all of my quilting ladies buying it, because they love what I come up with. 
      The Pelican Brief is a trilling novel by John Grisham.  It follows a suspenseful chase after an attractive female law student. She is hunted for knowing just a little too much then the government can handle. I was not her fault that she was seeking the truth about the resent murders of the chief justices. But, it was her fault that her lover, who was also her professor was killed in a hot wired car bomb accident that was actually intended for her as well. The book follows her insane escape out of the country to escape death that she was well overdue for.       I do not major in law nor am I a fan of lawyers. However, I found this book interesting because of its continues changing plot that keeps the reader under a slight suspense.  The chase after the female law student had more twists and close encounters then the affair of Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton.       The book is recommended both individuals with or without legal background as well. And anyone that is interested in a different perspective on the United States Government and their ultimate domination of power over people 
 I actually like this version more than the American version...prehaps because I saw it years ago.  I thought all the characters were a delight and the over all message of the story will have your heart singing...and you contemplating dance lessons 
 A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him.  It's a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as "Maximum Bob" and "Stick" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick). I thought this was his best since "Striptease." The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.  Incidentally, isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no?  
 I originally read this book when it came out as a Macmillan hardback some years ago. The new Carrol Graf edition has some fascinating new insights by the author as of 2001. Undoubtedly this re-issue was timed to coincide with Edwin Black's other major book, IBM and the Holocaust. Although I have read both books, I am still gripped by the power and drama of Transfer Agreement--must reading for those who to understand the State of Israel, Zionism and its intersection with the Nazis. Powerful reading, this is history written as no one else can 
  This fiery red-headed tomboy has many adventures during her eleven-year-old life. She is afraid of nothing and plays all day with her brothers Tom and Warren. Caddie is always being pestered by her mother to become and lady. Caddie loves being able to run free and wild but she discovers a little longing to be like her sisters, who sew and cook all day. Her father just encourages and loves her being a tomboy. This story is set in Wisconsin in 1864 where many things happen. The little steamer comes in with the news, the circuit rider comes about once a year, cousin Annabelle visits, and a letter with a foreign letter comes for Caddie's father.    My favorite part in this book is when cousin Annabelle comes to visit and they play many tricks on her, but every time  Annabelle just picks herself right back up like a lady. Only one time did Annabelle get bent out of shape was when something "squishy" was put down her dress.    I think the theme of this book is to just be yourself and don't let others try to influence you. Caddie is a tomboy and she will always be one no matter how hard people try to change her.   I think this book was very good. It was well written and had a good vocabulary. Caddie Woodlawn intrigued you and kept you reading because you want to know what happens. This book is all about Caddie Woodlawn and her adventures and they sure are interesting.   I recommend this book to young to middle age teenage girls. They will enjoy this book because it is about a girl. But, it is also about a young girl being who she wants to be. It is a very fun book to read 
 I picked up this book over the summer based on the rave reviews of my amazon colleagues.  I'll admit to being surprised at first, for the cover (which looked modern) distracted me from the fact that this book is over half a century old.    I'm a contemporary sci-fi fan, I think authors can use modern-day technological topography to look "so far out".  That's just my thing.  Well, I'm glad I gave this book a chance, because while it's more fantasy than sci-fi, technology took a back seat to the philosophical and sociological impacts of tech.  In this case, a major human evolutionary leap.  Sturgeon describes the origination of a new breed of man.  A man that's not one man, but a combination of parts, each serving a distinct and specialized function.  Most of the book is dedicated to the gestation and organization of this species.  I think I'd be more interested in More Than Human 2...I'd love to see the social, technological, and moral impacts to a world filled with "Homo-Gestalts" as the author calls them.  That aside, this book is a worthwhile read.  The writing was "Hemmingway-like" in it's elegant simplicity, yet the environments were vivid, and the characters well-developed.  Enjoy,  Christian Hunter Santa Barbara, Californi 
 I read this book because I had nothing better to do at the time, and I believe there is nothing better I could have done with my time. This book changed the way I view money, work, time, and life.  This book will not make you rich. It will not give you all the answers. It will start you asking the right questions. This book does for wealth creation what "7 Habits" did for personal development.  There are a lot of titles on offer from Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad" empire, many of which you can take or leave. "Cashflow Quadrant" and "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" are non-negotiable.  If you have any desire at all to be in control of your finances, you must buy this book, read it, re-read it, and then read it again.  Then get out there and do something 
 Ill preface my review by saying that im quite an audiophile, and music is more than my passion; its my living. I have loved pretty much every form of metal ive heard and this is no exception. What Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" is to classical, Meshugga's "Catch Thirty-Three" is to metal.  This is indeed my first Meshugga album ive purchased (but believe me, not the last!) and from start to finish, I never once felt the urge to track surf. It begins and continues with a bombastic repetativeness that not only becomes hypnotic in a Pink Floyd-esque style, but flows and ebbs in movement-type feelings through a wide range of face melting metal to ambient and removed soundscapes; the entirety of the album I was glued in front of my speakers.  I almost gave this CD a 4 though on the premise that in its entirety it builds through and through to an epic proportion only to finish with a very non-climactic ending; something (as I said all through listening to the CD) I didnt expect.  Everything meshes and flows together nicely so that its not just an album with a collection of songs, like pretty much everyone elses albums, but a work. A single piece of finely crafted workmanship. This album, simply put, is a metal masterpiece 
 While I did have some trouble getting into this book, I decided that it was because I was reading it in ten or twenty page segments. It is much better read in several long sittings. That aside, I can honestly say that I was quickly drawn into the mysteries of Avoca.  Dallas captures the language, the customs, the dress, everything about the depression era 30's with the understanding of a person who had lived then. So clearly, she has done her homework.  I loved Aunt Polly. She is a woman filled with wisdom and many talents.  I believe that she had a fondness for Nora that she was not to willing to show too quickly.  She probably knew more about Nora, than Nora knew about herself, just by her instincts.  The situation between Nora and her husband and how that all ended came as no surprise. Reading between the lines, it was all rather predictable.  Still and all it was tragic.  By the time Nora has been accepted by the main players as a member of "old Natchez" and the mystery has been solved, the book ends on a very upbeat note, in a room as bright and white as Avoca was dark and dreary in the beginning 
 Victorian America is a breezy yet intelligent overview of American life, especially middle class life, from 1876-1915.  At times it reads as almost a laundry list of innovations and changes, but that's not a bad approach.  This time period in American history is fascinating but extremely complex.  The author manages to explain why the changes in technology affected the social life of today's Americans without being boring.  This book serves as a great introduction to a pivotal turning point 
 I first read this book when I was a student in TV back in the mid '70's. The stories behind the birth of modern media remain fascinating. I literally could not put the book down and went on to read the other two in Barnouw's trilogy. It was an incredible insight into the sometimes crazy world I was about to enter and I have never forgotten how riveted I was to every word 
 The DVD single "Can I Go Now" is an absolute treat.  It features the music videos for "Can I Go Now" and "Barenaked," both directed by Liz Friedlander.  A photo gallery is also included, which features 9 great snapshots.  The picture and sound quality is superb.  This is a must-have for all Jennifer Love Hewitt fans 
 This is the best comic book I've read in years! If you like romance, mangas, video games, musicals and kung fu movies, this comic is made for you!  The drawings are also uber cute! Kudos to the author! 
 Even though I knew that Disney movie and the various other adaptions out there were more sugar-coated than the original, this turned out to be a rather darker and more sinister book than I expected. Funny and charming and all that, too...but a little creepy in the way seemingly innocuous dreams sometimes are, when everything goes a little sideways and suddenly you aren't so sure everything is fine any more. Peter himself seems far less benevolent a soul than he is usually made out to be. In even the less flattering renditions of the story, he is usually only portrayed as childish, proud and a little selfish, but a stand-up sort of fellow nonetheless. The way I'm reading the book, he's practically a hedonist. The only thing that saves him is the fact that he has brief moments of chivalry and a memory like a goldfish. He and Dorian Gray should get together. Or maybe, on second thought, they shouldn't. Since that could lead to disturbing slashfic.  Seriously, this book made me sadder than I could ever have anticipated. Peter really is mercilessly heartless in his laughing, self-centered innocence. It really hurt my heart to think of Wendy and all her female descendants all giving their hearts' first love to Peter, one after another; the older, wiser women unable to save the girls from breaking their hearts over him in their turn.  Fantastic book, though, and a real treat for those who like to pick a book apart from a psychologist's point of view 
 I am a big fan of Greg Isles.  If you enjoy thrillers, I strongly suggest that you try reading his work.  It's not very often when a book keeps me up past midnight, but this book managed to do it.  I found THE QUIET GAME enormously enjoyable, if not particularly believable.  Unfortunately, this book stumbles when it comes to the story.  Things just get more and more unbelievable, especially if you know anything about the law or politics.  You have to believe that a major, multimillion dollar trial would be held one week after a lawsuit was filed, which is a virtual impossibility.  I'm a lawyer, and I didn't find much of the trial (which took less than a day) to be believable.  You also have to swallow an Oliver Stone-like storyline (vast right wing conspiracy in the FBI).  If this plot happened in real life, it would be the news story of the decade, but Isles treats it as primarily a local story in Mississippi!  This is one of those books here you have to set aside your disbelief in order to make it work.  In my case, though, I did. I love the quality of Isles' writing, and he just knows how to write suspense.  In the end, THE QUIET GAME did what it was supposed to do: it kept me turning the pages, wondering what was going to happen next.  Strongly recommended 
 This is one of those classics that belong beside Fred Brooks "The Mythical Man-Month" in your library.  (And your mind)     The examples are in Java and C++ (ick--I am a .Net programmer), but the generic nature of the material in the book has made it useful to me in the .Net camp.  In some ways, reading it from a .Net background has helped since it forces thought.  This book is packed with great tips--most of which apply in any language.  I highly recommend this to any software developer regardless of technology leanings. I recently recommended it in our area .Net User's Group meeting--which for a book that contains Java is HIGHLY unusual 
 first, anything with daniel day lewis is a must-see. though his work is sporadic, he is one of the best actors of his generation. throw in emma thompson, director jim sheridan, a great supporting cast and an inspiring true story and you have a great movie 
 I really enjoyed this book. You can feel the pain of the loss of her son in this book, which makes it so real. 
 Just got this CD off a mate - its great! I am listening to it at work at the moment - the sun is shining, my ipod is cranking and its put me in a really good mood! Some of the obligatory big mainstream tracks (call on me, the big track, love on my mind) but also some less mainstream (well previously they were) -nice bass lines!  Luvn it 
 The Tears of Eros is a fitting culmination of Bataille's search for value through excess.  Although Bataille addresses many of the themes touched on here in greater detail in earlier works (Eroticism, The Accursed Share),  The Tears of Eros is notable for the significant amount of artwork included  to illustrate the connection Bataille develops between sex, death,  expenditure, and sovereign value.  This is a "must-read" for any  serious student of contemporary philosophy and--for that matter--any who  would insist that value resides elsewhere than in a petty, bourgeois  individualism 
 You can really feel the emotion in these songs, especially "Tangled Up in Blue" and "If You See Her, Say Hello." But for me the song that really sums up the way Bob Dylan was feeling when he put out this album is "Buckets of Rain," because this album is certainly full of buckets of tears. Bob Dylan's voice is in pure form on this album and the two bands that back him on the songs really seemed tuned into what Dylan is singing about. These songs of love and pain are certainly some of Bob Dylan's best work 
 Kevin Leman has done it again - written a great book with excellent examples and practical applications.  We have really enjoyed this book.  It has helped us understand each other and open up our communication 
 I got Halo 2 a few weeks ago and this is my favorite game of the year. I have to admit that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the PlayStation 2 is a very good game but I am a fan of Xbox more.

 The  " Queen of Technicolor " Maureen O' Hara co - stars with Tyrone Power ( as Jamie Waring ) in this swashbuckler Directed by the now neglected Henry King. ( The Gunfighter ) Also featured are Thomas Mitchell ( It's a Wonderful Life ), Laird Cregar ( I Wake Up Screaming ) as a flamboyant Sir Henry Morgan, and George Sanders ( in a red beard) first as a friend then opponent of " Jamie boy ", as he is called by Maureen. The techicolor is great, but I wish that the action was done at a swifter pace, for that reason this film doesn't rate 5 stars with me.  An added plus is the commentary provided by Maureen O' Hara 
 I'm completey caught off guard by the most recent review I just read dated 6/5/06 and given 1 star.  Without reading the rest of my review, understand I am essentially the counterpoint to everything the reviewer said.    It took me a few pages (maybe 20 or so) to get hooked on this book.  At first the details are hazy and it's hard to be sure you're understanding the plot and how the characters themselves are linked.  Soon however the haze begins to dissipate and I actually think the reader subconsciously takes pride in this which draws them to read further.  By the end of the first story I was completely immersed and went back to re-read parts that I'd bookmarked because I found the prose so moving.  The book is in 3 parts which are separate stories if you will, but center around a similar theme.    I even feel his writing changes with each story as you might expect.  The first story can be as difficult to follow at times as perhaps other literary greats of the 1800's, yet leaves you tingly.  The prose is flawless.  The second story could easily be a paperback thriller, though far away deeper.  The prose is to the point and very easy.  In this story you're more drawn to the plot than the prose.  The prize of the third story is making connections and seeing things come together.  Seeing the characters you've grown to understand come together once more, again in very different ways.  I love this book and I think it ranks up there with Cunningham's other works.  I was very happy with this book 
 Those who have a closed mind will hate it because it clearly with use of time line graphs clearly show how inefective most of governemt's programs are.  In fact, the only way you can debate the book is just to say "it's nuts" or "don't confuse me with facts" or some other "argument" like that.  It's lucid, well-written and I'd even go as far as calling it revolutionary in its approach to analysing statistical data.  It shows you, for example, how when you look at what happened AFTER a goverment program was put in place has not changed at all the pace of changes which were already taking place.  In other words, the graphs slope hasn't changed.  A super exapmple of logical thinking so much needed in today's society.  
 It all started with British guitarist/vocalist Robert Huxley,a member of a British beat group "The Saxons"(where he used the name Robbie Gale)."The Saxons" were enlisted by legendary record producer Joe Meek to become "The New Tornados".Then Joe Meek died tragically.While touring the middle east with The New Tornados,Huxley met some Israeli musicians and formed the psychedelic band "Churchills",who cut one Israeli album in 1967.All but the lead singer relocated to England,where they became "Jericho Jones"(cutting the album "Monkeys,Junkies & Donkeys"),then shortening their name to "Jericho" for their self-titled second album.Both albums were originally taped for "Red Bus Productions",who licensed them to A&M.But,when he group refused to play gigs that "Red Bus" had booked in South Africa,"Red Bus" terminated the recording deal,blocking the group from recording directly for A&M.The group disbanded.The four Israelis went back to Israel,and Rob Huxley moved to Florida,where he lives happily to this day,and occasionally makes music 
 Billy Joel enjoyed a run of mega hit albums in the late 70's, that capped off with 1980's release Glass Houses (see my review). Songs from these albums; The Stranger, 52nd Street, and the aforementioned Glass Houses became concert staples, yet Billy always included a number of his earlier songs in concert, and as the liner notes state, these songs always enjoyed a great reception.  At this point in his career, Billy was also adament that he was not ready to release a greatest hits album.  The solution?, a live disk that would showcase his songs, PRE Stranger album, and he selected songs appropriate for a live reading. As Billy also stated in this albums liner notes he did not inlcude songs that would not "translate" well in a live setting. This is why Piano Man is not featured here, yet Captain Jack is.  The arena impact of Miami 2017, Say Goodbye To Hollywood, and The Ballad of Billy The Kid, balance the intimate environs set for Summer Highland Falls, She's Got A Way, and Your My Home.   An added treat from this album was hearing 2 of the songs from the Cold Spring Harbor album (She's Got A Way, and Everybody Loves You Now), since at the point that this disk was released,  those of us lucky to have had a vinyl copy of Cold Spring Harbor had to "imagine" what these tracks sounded like for real since the pressings of Cold Spring Harbor were recorded too fast and thus Billy sounded in spots like one of the Chipmuncks.  The final track is my favorite, and I Loved These Days, seemed to be foreshadowing on Billy's part, that his musical career would take new directions with is next studio album (which it did).         
 I thought I was the only one with a child like this.  Thanks to this book, my daughter learned to cope with life and I learned to enjoy her company.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you 
 I bought a pair for each of my twin girls.  The younger one likes them and loves to squeak(who isn't walking yet).  My old twin took them off.  We will have to see what happens.  The girls are 14 months 
 The three chapters in this book talk about everything from where the raw fiber comes from and how it's processed to how to knit with it and how to buy the best quality yarns. The pictures in each chapter are incredible, like a National Geographic. And each chapter has patterns for that particular type of fiber, designed with each fibers' characteristics in mind. The cashmere cape with mink trim is stunning, and the baby items are so cute.  This book is more than just a pattern book because of all the information in each chapter. I think it's a must-have for any serious knitter, and a beautiful book to flip through even if you don't knit 
 I really love this cd! the songs are good and great to dance to! 
 This should be considered a classic.  I agree it makes a great baby gift; I have tucked it in with newborn outfits.  I started reading it to my girls at 6 months old.  They both love it. There are sooo many animal books out there, but this one is worth looking at.   
 This book is well written and the recipes are very easy to follow.  The recipes created by Tess and Mark are so close to the store bought beers you would be hard pressed to tell the difference.  I have been home brewing for many years and have won several competitions using the recipes from this book. The Pilsner Urquell and the Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout are exceptional (just to mention a couple)!!   Follow the recipes, be patient while the beer carbonates, and enjoy 
 I bought this album about three years ago and to this day whip-smart is still my favorite album. Liz Phair is a genius. Her song-writing is incredible, her voice a relentless pitbull, and her image, a true reniassance. All the songs I love, especially Nashville, Go West, and the album closer, May Queen. A lot of people think she sold out with her later albums but hey a girl's gotta get paid. Exile in Guyville is considered her masterpiece, and i think it's a great album but for me, whip-smart is her masterpiece. Totally under-rated, this album has smart lyrics and great guitar playing. You can decide for yourself but Whip-smart is one cd that will never be used as a coaster 
 I really loved this next book and now can't wait for the third book in this Restoration series.  In this book, services and functions improve a bit (using pre-computer technology) and the people become very practical.  Concerns of left-behind children, etc. come into the picture.    Excellent series and kind of comforting to know we can survive a crisis of this type 
 I READ THE EXTINCT ALPHABET BOOK.  THE MOST INTERESTING ANIMAL WAS THE HALLUCIGENIA.  IT'S LEGS LOOK LIKE TOOTHPICKS. THEY HAD EIGHT ON EACH SIDE.  IT IS THE BEST ALPHABET BOOK EVER 
  I never heard this movie, But my friend got this one day and we watched it together..ohh man, this is really thrilling suspense ,nail biting, heart pounding ,got me in edge of my seat the whole time!! Cant believe never heard or saw this movie much earlier years and I am VERY glad finally this over looked thriller got my eyes and attention, don't miss this masterpiece of JAMIE LEE CURTIES..She done a great job in this crazy, hard pounding thriller'!!!  I bought this movie next day for my DVD collection, but don't miss it!!!  A+   
 First off this is a fun accessory for my A95 and A80. At about 26mm lens you can shoot some very nice wide angle landscapes to close-ups for under $100. The lens is sharp and is a nice piece of coated class. Once mounted you zoom lens works inside the adapter so you probably have a 26mm to 40mm (total guess)zoom lens. Yes it does have barrel distortion, yes it does stick out and block the flash, yes it is black and it does look a bit dorky on the camera. So either go buy a digital rebel and a 19-35 zoom for over $1000 or correct the barrel distortion in your image editing program, use a slaved flash for indoor shooting (manual mode only) and paint it silver. Bottom line...if you like the look of wide angle, don't mind or even like a very very mild barrel distortion (ever so slight fisheye look), and are good with silver paint, then for the price of a cheap hotel room or a nice meal for two, you can have a lot of fun with this accessory. Highly recommended!! 
 Just now catching up on a lot of the good music/groups I didn't appreciate in my younger life. Pink Floyd is definitely one I've been missing out on. Good music, crisp, clear sound. Only overshadowed, slightly, by Dark Side of the Moon 
 Our cats used to wake us up early in the morning when they wanted to be fed. Now they jump out of bed when they hear the cat crackers released at the same time every morning. They no longer run over us to wake us up to feed them. Also they are fed at the same time every afternoon - whether we are working or not. A great product !! 
 It's a credit to Thomas Keightley's "World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves & Other Little People" that it's still a relevant mythologic source today, over a hundred years after it was first published. The stories, explanations and legends are still as informative as they were in 1880, although they are rather restricted.  Okay, "World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People" sounds like a cutesy title for a Brian Froud-illustrated book. And it's a rather lightweight title for a book with genuine merit -- especially the "little people" part of it, since the elves, fey and gnomes in here are anything but dainty Victorian fairies.  Instead, Keightley focuses on traditional goblins, dwarves and elves -- Scandinavian trolls and beautiful alfar, Germanic Zwerge and kobolds, British fairies, Celtic spirits and seal-men, and the epic sagas that greatly influenced early fantasy authors like J.R.R. Tolkien and George MacDonald. Take a look at the chapter on the "Eddas and Sagas," and it's hard not to think of Middle Earth.  Its one flaw is that it's restricted mostly to Europe -- there's a brief chapter on African superstitions, and one for Judaistic ones. Other than that, nothing that originates outside Europe. While it's understandable, considering the time that Keightley lived in, it's hard not to wonder if he couldn't have found out at least a few other cultural legends.  However, this is a rich source for European myths and legends, especially since Keightley obviously did his research. He includes snippets of untranslated poetry, ballads, and footnotes detailing migratory myths and differing versions.  He also summarizes some of the denser material like the two Eddas, which are extremely long and sometimes difficult.  Though Thomas Keightley wrote this a hundred and twenty-five years ago, "The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People" is still a valuable and informative resource for anyone interested in European myths and legends. So ignore the title 
 Independence Day is a solid, easy read, even though it is light on action and heavy on internal monologue. This is the third Ford book I've read in the last month and a half, along with "A Multitude of Sins" and "...Day's" pre-quel, "The Sportswriter." I don't know how many more books I need to read by Ford because his narrative style is essentially the same in all I've read. Ford writes convincingly, and with lush, genius, award-winning detail, about hapless, resigned middle to upper middle class men. Frank Bascombe is the Holden Caulfield for the Volvo set or anyone dealing with their own "existence period."  In " Independence Day" I found myself wishing Bascombe would get all passionate and out-of-control like he did at the end of "The Sportswriter." But this novel does not end like its prequel did, with a crazy cross country journey and eventual expatriation to France. "Independence Day," appropriate to its title, ends with Bascombe alone, after chatting with a superficial friend and neighbor, taking in the quiet, sedate, suburban scenes of holiday Haddam, NJ.  Okay, I lied. I'll read at least one more Ford book. "Rock Springs" next 
 I desparately wanted to like this book as a child, but even with my advanced reading level, I never enjoyed it.  In my late teens I tried again, and was finally able to appreciate Anne of Green Gables for what it is-- a fun and timeless classic.  Over the years I have read and re-read the entire series, always delighted, engaged, and sad to see it end 
 Mother Jones is informing us about Trade Agreements and how we can save our jobs in the USA.  When unions try to fight the corporations in order to get health benefits for their employees and not have to take cuts in their paychecks the company threatens to leave.  Saying: "Like it or you won't have any jobs at all."  This isn't Fair Trade, it is going for the "cheap labor" overseas.  This magazine is getting the message out and I love it. They are exposing the truth about NAFTA and CAFTA. We all need more information like this so we can save the economic future of our country.  If we do not, we the consumer, will not earn enough to pay for the items we buy.  This means goods sit in warehouses, the company stock goes down and the stock market crashes like in 1929.  We need to fix it now.  Read this magazine. 
 if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd 
 Sorry, if you're looking for Jodeci or Keith Sweat or freaking ugly a** John Legend, don't even try to act disappointed because you knew before you bought or listened the CD that these guys wouldn't compare. They have a style of their own...  Anyways, I give the CD 5 stars just because I don't have to skip not one song on the CD. It it great music to ride around to or have in the background when I am cleaning or studying. It was given to me as a gift because I was afraid to spend my own money on it, but now that I have it I find myself wanting to give it as gifts to all my homegirls. And when they come out with that hot sophmore release, your girl will be buying 2 copies...I do not feel that Pretty Ricky are degrading women, I feel that they're saying some freaky stuff I wish my man would say to me sometimes, not matter how juvenile or freaky the content might be.   For the people that thing Pretty Ricky sing about underage or younger girls, read & listen to their lyrics carefully. They're talking about hooking older women...Hence, "Ima show you how Stella Got Her Groove Back". Stella is an older women who got back in swing with a younger man...Duh...  It is entertainment and that needs to be considered. I do not think that Pretty Ricky were aiming for a Grammy. It's just fun, freaky music for us young folks (not to young-content explicit) to groove to...  And about the Jodeci thing...Let us not forget that Jodeci had some nasty hits too *cough*"Freekin You"*cough 
 This book on the seldom addressed quindecile aspect clearly explains the psychological implications inherent in quindeciles.  Many chart examples of well-known figures are used, making this book accessible to astrologers of all levels of experience.  Knowing about quindeciles illuminates often overlooked dimensions of the birthchart.  Highly recommended 
 "Fortune's Formula" tells the story of the Kelly Criterion -through the experiments, ideas, wins, and losses of those who have espoused it and who have derided it, at race tracks, black jack tables, sports books, and, finally, on Wall Street. The Kelly Criterion is a risk management formula published in 1956 by Bell Labs information theorist John Kelly, Jr. that dictates how much of your bankroll you should bet based on your edge divided by the odds so that you will have zero risk of ruin no matter how bad your luck is, while increasing wealth faster than any other betting system. It does not address what bets you should make, which is another matter entirely. Instead of writing a simple analysis of the Kelly Criterion, author William Poundstone brings this story alive by relating the histories of key figures who have used, promoted, or criticized the Kelly Criterion: information theorists, economists, traders, gamblers, and gangsters. Some readers may find this approach unfocused and unnecessary. But I think the personalities lend "Fortune's Formula" an epic quality and place the Kelly Criterion firmly in the context of real life, with real consequences, as opposed to the realm of abstruse theories that never leave the halls of academe.  The men whom "Fortune's Formula" casts as protagonists are Claude Shannon, the MIT scholar who invented information science and who amassed a small fortune as a buy-and-hold investor, typically making 28% per year on a small portfolio, and Ed Thorpe, author of 1962's gambling classic "Beat the Dealer", 1967's "Beat the Market", co-founder of Princeton-Newport Partners fund (1969-1988) and founder of Ridgeline Partners (1994-2002) quant fund. Ed Thorpe's transformation from MIT egghead to black jack sharp to Wall Street wizard in an ongoing theme, as Thorpe is an immensely successful advocate of the Kelly Criterion -and he is still alive. There is unfortunately little information on John Kelly, because he died in 1965 at the age of 41. The key Kelly challenger is 1970 Nobel Laureate economist Paul Samuelson, who probably overstates his case in calling the Kelly Criterion a "complete swindle" when the point of disagreement seems to be the concept of "utility" in long-tern outcome. Whatever one thinks of Samuelson's outspoken arrogance, he is certainly entertaining. Mobster Manny Kimmel makes an appearance, as do traders Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, and John Meriwether, as well as numerous information theorists.  William Poundstone obviously has a point of view. He is an advocate of the Kelly Criterion, believing that it produces better results than any other betting system over the long haul while withstanding even the most unlikely confluences of catastrophe that have a way of manifesting themselves periodically. He doesn't support efficient market hypothesis. He thinks people can, and have, made money consistently on the stock market. -But that you need a darned good method of managing risk to do it, a better method than Value at Risk reports. "Fortune's Formula"'s fascination is not only in its history of the Kelly Criterion, but in the realization that a risk management formula has so many seemingly disparate applications. As Poundstone says, "The idea pops up in the strangest places. 
 I got this book at Easter and have made several of the recipes.  All have been good, a few outstanding. (The "good" ones were tasty but identifiable as a low-fat product.  The outstanding ones were as good as a full-fat counterpart.)  However, I can't give this book 5 stars because the nutrition information given is lacking a key aspect:  no carbohydrate information is provided.  Fat, calories, protein, etc., are all listed, but no carbohydrate.  That makes figuring American Diabetic Association or American Dietetic Association exchanges hard to do accurately.  One can make a guess of the starch exchanges from the calories, but carbohydrate information would allow one to figure exchanges much more precisely.  Since this IS a book of baked goods, not giving the carbohydrate information is like reviewing a new brand of gasoline and detailing all the ingredients EXCEPT the octane.  Hard to believe, given that the author is a nutritionist, and makes you wonder if they are trying to downplay how much sugar and complex carbs are in the recipes.  Since many "low-fat" products are unhealthy precisely because they use great amounts of sugars and starches to taste good despite the lack of fat, you have to wonder about these recipes, too 
 This book is about a little bear that goes outside and plays in the snow.  He also goes to the moon and meets a moon mother. On his birthday he makes birthday soup for his friends because he thinks his mom forgot it was his birthday.  He has trouble going to sleep so he makes wishes and one of them come true.  Then they talk about all of the events that already happened in the story.  The lesson this book teaches is that you should have fun and listen to your parents.  	THE AGE LEVEL IS UNDER  
 If you're looking for a true balls to the wall speed/hardcore metal assault, well you've come to the right place with The Haunted's One Kill Wonder. Of their 4 releases including 2004's Revolver (with original vocalist Peter Dolving), this album is their most vicious and heaviest to date. The album starts off with the instrumental intro Privitation of Faith Inc., then kicking into hyperdrive with the ultra vicious God Puppet which will just leave you flat. Other great songs such as Downward Spiral, Sh*thead, Shadow World, D.O.A., Bloodletting, and the title track keep the relentless brutality coming. Marco Aro screams and growls like a monster possessed. Guitarists Jensen and Anders Bjorler's relentless twin riffing resemble that of thrash legends Slayer, and the solos are just killer as well.  Per Moller Jensen's double bass drums will keep rumbling in your head for days. So if you're looking for a metal album to scream your head off and slam to whenever you're pissed, One Kill Wonder is an excellent choice. All hail The Haunted, thrash metal is alive and well. STAY METAL 
 BG Upton Failed, MAJ Vandergriff will not!  Great book!11 The pending war, excepting, for Army to take the lead promote Vandergriff-MacGregor (COL-Braeking The Phalanx-at Ndu in D.C.,) now! With their views the army can take over as the premeir fighting force in 21st century-with decisive victories 
 Let me list you some names of actors I spotted in this-Peter Chan(plays like the same exact charcter in Prodigal Son, The Legend, and Deadful Melody), Lee Hoi San(36th Chamber, Goose Boxer), Simon Yuen(Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, Drunken Master), Dai Sai-aan(rightly nicknamed "little big eye", he's in everything and has amazing Chinese opera skills), Ho Pak-kwong(great character actor from Killer Wears White-aka Shadow Ninja), Fan Mei sheng(one of the best character actors ever, fay guy from Jackie chan's the Young Master), Cheung Yan Yuen(guy who plays a taoist master in ALL of Woo ping's movies but doesn't in this one), and then the vampire like guy with the hunchback you will also recognze from all of Woo Ping's stuff.  And then just like the great film Dance of the Drunken Mantis, Shun-Yi Yuen(Chief Fox in Iron Monkey) plays the hero.    I have to say that the kung fu in this flick is absolutely dazzling.  Even with Chief Fox as the hero, he is able to perform pretty well. The final fight I would call anythign but spectacular but since it is from the great Woo Ping, expect a ton of acrobatics and just beautifal choreography in general.  The story is entertaining and the end left me dissatisfied but the amazing footwork and hand to hand gives it the 4/5 stars.    This dvd from Tai Seng has an English, Mandarin, and a Chinese soundtrack, BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUBTITLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Shame on you tai seng, you also did this with the movie "The Victim".    Picture quality could have been better as it is very washed out and has a white bar on the left side of the screen for about the first 20 minutes. But it is nicely widescreened and I genereally don't ask for more than that.  
 This book explains why so many of us have had a vague feeling of distrust for the cultural diversity and affirmative action crowd. They always seemed a bit slimy while promoting very worthwhile goals. If Steele is right, it is because of the unstated and underlying superiority that the left elites exude.  This could also explain why every big government program designed to "help" the poor and downtrodden ends up having the opposite effect.  I hope that this book heralds the beginning of a new phase in civil rights. The first phase was the struggle against institutional discrimination that MLK was a part of. The second phase has been this long protracted period of highly dysfunctional black anger and white guilt. Perhaps we are now moving into a new period of black/white partnership of real progress. We can hope so.  This book is a definite worthwhile read. It is short and concise and the author pulls no punches. He makes his case directly. My only complaint is that the book could have used a little better editing. There are times when it is repetitive and not quite as tight as it could be. Still it is an excellent book, and very culturally relevant 
 One of the funniest books i have ever read!  when i first started reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series i couldn't believe i had gone through my life without knowing his books were out there.  i am an ultimate film fan and i cracked up at all the references.  this was to movie fans what Soul Music was to music lovers.  Discworld is for everyone who loves mystery, adventure, and above all, a good laugh 
 Much like 3 Days of the Condor (1976), No Way Out was a well done political thriller with some steamy sex scenes that were easily on par with some of the sex scenes around.  It features everything you'd want from a good thriller, a good cast, incl. Kevin Costner & Gene Hackman, some good music, & some good acting moments that keep it an "on the edge of your seat" movie. It starts out with Tom Farrell (Costner) explaining to some Russian moles what happened to him at the Pentagon.  He says that he knew his mission was just to get some info, but the love affair with Susan Atwell (Young) was just a fling, roughly.  Atwell & Farrell meet a military banquet honoring the top brass.  They leave the party, get into a limo, & have some steamy sex that's beautifully done & expert camerawork as well. David Brice (Hackman) & his right hand man Scott Pritchard (Patton) are discussing Farrell's feats in the Navy & decide to give him a cushy job in the Pentagon.  After a late night get-together & a weekend trip Brice shows up, but Farrell leaves before Brice can see who it is, but Brice was standing in a streetlight.  Brice suspects Susan of cheating & accidently kills her by slapping her so hard she falls through a coffee table. Pritchard then after being told the details decides to come up with a mole called Yuri who killed her & knew about her.  They send all of the available info on Susan's life prior to the murder down to a lab at the Pentagon to find out who it was.  What they really find is a negative from a Polaroid that proves to be a vital clue for them.  Slowly but assuredly Farrell finds out that all of the clues are pointing back to him so he has to wrap up his work there soon.  He knows that the hotel's bellhop knows him, as well as the guy who lent him a boat, the picture she took of him, & phone calls she placed/received. Farrell does a masterful job of evading the spotlight of suspicion all the time by doing things to avoid being in the same area as the search party.  At the end, he suspects Pritchard of being the mole, he kills himself after an argument between Farrell & Brice.  Brice doesn't know it but a jewel box could be what very well leads to his being nabbed as the killer of Susan Atwell.  Farrell meets his Russian spies & decides to flee Washington, DC just as the movie winds up. The story is really well done & shines in the movie.  The camerawork is really good, as is the music, special effects, & the pacing, but the pacing is uneven at spots but generally well done. 
 You know that saying, "That's what dreams are made of?" That's what this book does for friendships. If every teenager, woman, or child of God had this book, there wouldn't be any lonely girls, women, or mothers in the world. It's a wonderful tribute to growing lasting relationships that stand the test of time and even distance 
 What a wonderful book! Photographs are beautifully done, and a great selection of authentic recipes too. Would highly recommend this 
 Great movie and extremely powerful and motivational. I am a 42 year old African American male military war veteran (single parent)with a BA in Social Science and a ThM in Theology. I have coached, taught and ministered to my people; African Americans. Only to become discouraged in the fight and caught in the same traps; sex, drugs, anger, remorse, unforgiveness, hate, regret, shame, mental pain etc. I fought so hard for others of my race not to placate to; even to the point of using drugs. But GLORY has come! This movie has given me new strenght to continue to advocate, fight and defend (help) my enslaved (physical or mental)people. I am also ordering extra copies for all individuals I am lead to help by the anointing, gifts and Spirit in me. Thank you God for this anointed message and gift; SLAM (1998). "What an encouragement. 
 This is the second time I've purchased this same themometer. There was nothing wrong with the first. I purchased the second one as a gift for a friend who was always bugging me to give her my original themometer.  Temp is accurate and the color code scale makes reading very simple. The long probe also keeps hands well away from the fire. No batteries to replace when you need to check the temp of a nice roast and no reading the instructions on how to operate digital units. Simply insert the probe into a thick area of the meat away from the bone and match the appropriate color to your desire of doneness 
 i placed two orders from this same seller for the same dvd and both came in very quickly in excellent condition there were no problems with making my payment or anything else thank you very much will be looking forward to ordering from you agan. i got two of the same video cuz my daughter wanted her own copy and needed one for the house als 
 I loved this book and could not put it down!  I'm so disappointed to be finished with it.  I look forward to my next Geraldine Brooks novel 
 The book by Dr.C.Rajagopalachari , gives a glimpse of the life and times of Lord Rama , and it's refined and stylistic presentation  has a wonderful relevance in the present day context of life at large and Spirituality in  specific. A great book, enjoyable and cherishable by one and all 
 Art restorer and occasional Israeli spy Gabriel Allon is back. He was introduced in The Kill Artist and it is one of the most interesting characters in recent literature.  The English Assassin brings him back in a new; better story and we continue to discover new layers in this complex character. Also, many of the secondaries introduced in Kill Artist are back. The book can be read on it's own, but be advised that it is the beginning of a trilogy dealing with Nazis and the Holocaust. The other two books of the trilogy are "The Confessor" and "A Death in Vienna". It is advisable; but not necessary to read them in order for better enjoyment and the sake of continuity.   If you are looking for a thriller, not too heavy in the action scenes and with a better character development and plot than the average this should be your choice. You will be back to visit with Gabriel Allon. 
 Dalbey writes the best book on parkway development ever. He is a modern day E. Howard. He put's the "green" in green-belts. I recommend this book to everyone interested in regional planning and parkway development 
 An experimental biography teeming with life. Up there with Andrei Rublev.  Also, the transfer to DVD looks great 
 Right after "Alone Together", blue Thumb issued a single called 'Satin Red & Black Velvet Woman", which is nice as anything on the LP, and it wasn't included on the very patchy "Headkeeper".  It's become a lost track, even tho it actually charted a week or two!  What a dang shame that BGO didn't bother to fit it on this CD...which is the only reason why I haven't bought it, yet.  I'm disappointed that it isn't included.  Since "Headkeeper" is a such a patchy LP, I would've issued "Alone Together" with something close to the original nifty packaging and splatter CD, and included three lost Mason tracks:  "Just for You" and "Little Woman", issued as a solo single for UK Island and both sides features Family as the accompanying musicians.  "Just For You" was subsequently included on "Last Exit", but it wasn't a Traffic track.  "Satin Red & Black Velvet Woman"  Then, they could've coupled "Headkeeper" with the also patchy "Dave Mason & Cass Elliot" blue Thumb LP!  
 Jamie Lee Curtis plays a college co-ed who and her friends throw a party on a train, and a killer is amoung them....   A good slasher movie of the 80's, David Cooperfield plays a sexy magician, who forms his wonderful magic, almost putting a spell on those ladies around him....  Just remember jokes could kill you........ 
 THE ESSENTIAL BLUE OYSTER CULT is yet another great Blue Oyster Cult anthology, with several songs not on either SUPER HITS or THE BEST OF BLUE OYSTER CULT: DON'T FEAR THE REAPER. However, despite the five-star rating I've given it, it is not absolutely the equal of the others because some songs are a little bit TOO weird for a person of my health-conscious lifestyle, and several great cuts available on the others have been cut in favor of these. Nevertheless, if you only have space for three Blue Oyster Cult albums in your collection, get this one, THE BEST OF, and SUPER HITS 
 EXCELLENT: ========= This is an amazing book with many sections that are gems! Shannon's theorem is explained so beautifully in such detail that I have never seen anything like it. The chapters on Optimum signal detection and error correction codes are so beautifully written and easy to follow that I want to congratulate the author. The section on how to calculate the power spectral density of different line codes like bipolar, split phase, and polar was the easiest to read yet very detailed.    BAD: ======== However the book is scattered. The same material sometimes is covered in multiple chapters in bits and pieces. Partially this is because the author wants to first introduce some of the concepts without discussing probability and later covers them again after studying probability. But, this still can't explain why things are so scattered.  The new chapters added in the third edition covering some of the new applications are not written well. The contribution by a guest author to one of the chapters was horrible!    What will make this book excellent is to get rid of the guest author and some of the new material, clean up the presentation of the fundamentals and present in a more unified matter.  This book is a good relief from reading Proakis. I have read many advanced books which were easy to read. The reason Proakis was hard to read wasn't because the subject was advanced but simply it wasn't written well.  p.s. My second edition was read so often that the glued pages started falling out. I bought the third edition and once again the glued pages fell out! I don't know if it is because this is one of the books I most frequently use or just the binding should be improved. 
 This is no light read. If you like to read books that address topics like abortion, lesbian relationships, incest,and violence then this is the book for you. The characters are very well done. All of the characters are interesting and you can't help but care what happens to each of them. The graphic medical details I could have done without but like another reviewer said, this book will stay with you. It will also make you think 
 As a long time dog owner (and ownee) I really enjoyed this movie. It is family oriented, very warm and has a wonderful ending.  In between I loved how the personalities of the various dogs were portrayed.  I happen to be partial to poodles but I liked the boxer best.  Would definitely recommend for light viewing.   
 Another of my King favorites...kind of ties in with Delores Clairborne 
 After having no fun with Lang's text "Algebraic Number Theory" I began seking out something more complete and which was full of quality exposition.  As a result of Amazon's approach to marketing towards members, I was recommended this book and decided quickly that I must have it.  This book is marvelously well written, examples are kept to an un-overwhelming minimum, the problems are not trivial (at least to me) and in fact I feel this is the kind of book on par with, say, Paulo Ribenboim's "Classical Theory of Algebraic Numbers" since these are both the type of book you would want to take with you on a long trip or as Paulo says, "while stranded on a desert island".  This book is by no means intended for those who are not fluent in both Number Theory as well as Algebra, both at the graduate level and obviously for those who are Mahematically gifted.  I highly recommend this book to graduate students interested in Algebraic number theory as well as those needing a splendid reference 
 I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY BROTHERS ROOM AS IT GETS COLD ON THOSE WINTER NIGHTS AND I DIDNT WANT HIM TO FREEZE GOT THIS HOPING IT WOULD AT LEAST MAKE IT MANAGABLE FOR HIM. BUT WE SOON FOUND OUT THIS HEAT KEEPS HIS ROOM SO WARM THAT YOU DONT EVEN NEED BLANKETS TO KEEP YOU WARM! HES VERY SATIFIED! HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL 
 The Flat LCD has bright color, decent sound, and many input options. I was dissapointed in the DVI input - I plugged my macbook pro in and found the image quite grainy.  I was also dissapointed with the composite in - I pluged my video ipod in and the resulting image wasn't great either.  All aside however, my xbox 360 going through the component looks fantastic. Even with games that have fast moving action, there is very little ghosting - the TV really keeps up.  The graphics look very sharp.  I played a DVD through the xbox and it looked very good as well. When I stopped thinking of this TV as a monitor I came to terms that the TV part is great, but it isn't a monitor.  The DVI port is a bit missleading.  There really should just be an HDMI port.  Overall though - great TV for little money 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this is a really great book, easy reading.   Written in plain English, not clinical or overly scientific.  Taught me  alot of things I wasn't aware of before and will use in caring for my  kitty.  I now look at my kitty differently and watch his body language with  new insight. I would recommend it for all cat owners especially first time  owners 
 This book easily complements my Win2K manuals. Most notable chapters are 28-29, i.e. Penetration Testing: Hack Your Own System and Writing Secure Code. Highly recommended for anyone trying to secure their Win2K environment. Pity it's not available in PDF 
 As someone who has always appreciated and been intrigued by the different religions of the world and the similarities between them, I love how this book makes them all relevant to my life & how I live it.  One thing that most impresses me about this book is the author's thoroughness and conviction.  In The Power of Now, Tolle basically describes the essence of Being - what it is to be in the now, and what it isn't.  He successfully does this by addressing the major life forces that affect our ability to be present - the mind, the body, death, time, space, etc. - without straying from the heart of the book.  His knowledge, appreciation and respect for so many of the ancient spiritual teachings, from Jesus, the Bible, Zen, Buddhism, Taoism, and more, is enlightening in itself and supports his message very effectively.  Although I didn't agree with every concept in the book, I appreciate the thoughtfulness and compassion with which each is presented.  Tolle is a true spiritual teacher who has much to offer in the practice of self-discovery.  I discovered The Power of Now via another excellent and enlightening book called How to Create a Magical Relationship, by Ariel & Shya Kane.  The Kanes have a similar approach to Tolle's regarding the value of living in the present with non-judgmental awareness, yet their style and delivery is different: their approach is more practical, with examples/illustrations from real people, rather than spiritual teachings. Tolle touches briefly on "Enlightened Relationships" in his book; for anyone interested in exploring the dynamics of magical or enlightened relationships, the Kanes' book is a wonderful companion. 
 If you are a collector of old school kung fu then you MUST have this in your collection! One of the best to come out during the golden era of the Shaw Bros. Also make sure you pick up the 1st DVD release as the picture is more acurate to what was released at the time it came out. And the dubbing is more what you came to expect of a great action packed old school flick. The new DVD release is a little too slick and polished for my taste and the dubbing is way off as one reviewer stated here 
 i love this one because they haev to go to school and count o. is the gym teacher adn makes them run for a VERY  lond time and is a great boo 
 I agree that every compiler writer (not engineer: programming is a cruelly difficult writing *sui generis*, not engineering) needs this book but its market is or should be much wider.  There is NO way to learn programming except at the intersection between compiler writing and applications programming, and it is a MISTAKE to teach programming as either a context-free application programmer's worship of machines and authority, or as the acquaintance with one programming language, its mistakes of design and implementation included, as Eleusinian mysteries demanding reverence.  Dijkstra, famously, described programming as applied mathematics. The concept of "applied" introduces an ineradicable tension between one discipline and another where the key ability is the ability to shuttle between layers of representation.  Crude language speaks airily of the needs of the user, where the user is hypostatized, singular, male, and imaged as wealthy and lacking taste. The actuality is that the relationship goes in computing all the way down, one user is also a worker for another, and only a programmer who has mastered his trade understands the need to transcend, in the course of understanding, the relationship.   Thus this book is useful not only to the compiler writer but also to the application programmer, because (for example), the application programmer has to understand at least in general terms how the For or Do construct of his language is evaluated.  He's importuned instead to meditate upon business needs with the result that something like 80% of large systems fail.  A programmer who, in Visual Basic, does not understand that For intIndex1 = 1 To intLimit - 1 is not "inefficient" because the expression is evaluated by value, doesn't know his trade. A programmer who, in C, doesn't know that while ( intIndex1 = 0; intIndex <= intLimit - 1; intIndex++ ) IS inefficient insofar as the expression is repeatedly evaluated doesn't know his trade, and the book is full of useful information about these important semantic issues.  Many programmers use the totally inappropriate automobile metaphor to describe the computer and in so doing they declare that no more than they would look under the hood of their car, they should be freed of important issues of semantics and if possible coherent and readable syntax in their mindless coding.  The metaphor confuses a force and energy determined system with an information engine. It also encapsulates a narrow understanding, restricted to America and other energy-wasteful societies, of what it means to relate, even to cars, for the atypical but thrifty American, who buys manual transmission used cars, or the Havana teen, who starts his car by rolling it down the hill, both are familiar, of necessity, with what goes on "under the hood"...or else.  A person with claims to professional writing skills would of course be familiar with semantics as well as syntax. But in programming, semantics is confused with "being a compiler developer or something".  Unlike natural language semantics, which bleeds out in history and sociology, programming language semantics is coeval with the "way the compiler works" in the sense of its specification, captured NOT in Programming Languages for Dummies BUT INSTEAD in the specifications document for the language.  [In France titles in the For Dummies series are "pour les nuls", which is *tres amusant*. I don't mean to slam this series which is well written and useful, but its title needs rethinking, for it at once asserts class pride and solidarity while disempowering in the very act of doing so.]   Good program design is based on knowing how the compiler "works" in the sense of understanding the language contract, which in C forces while evaluation by reference but in Visual Basic forces it by value.  The advanced material in this book on the implementation of Prolog and logic languages is important because it shows how far these languages are from being complete in the sense of first-order logic with quantification, which explains the survival of procedural languages.  My First Computer Book, special-ordered from the Roosevelt University Bookstore in 1971, was Peter Wegner's Information Structures, Programming Languages, and Machine Organization, a book in the Algol tradition which taught how to think at the Edge City, where the user's problem meets the circuits. This book, like Wegner, teaches the same lessons. About its only flaw is that like many titles from Morgan Kaufmann, which seems to have an incestuous relationship with MIPS and the RISC kiddies, it overemphasizes clever optimization and completely downplays the importance of the stack model of computation, a RISCy tradition. 
 Since I've changed my eating habits, I've been doing a lot of experimenting and exploring food-wise, and a friend suggested that I try Fran Costigan's book "More great good dairy-free desserts naturally". Well, I did, and I even went to a local book-signing at which the author (she's really nice, by the way) had dutifully served samples of recipes from her book - nearly all in chocolate. I just as dutifully sampled same, more out of a desire to be polite than anything else, as I was fully expecting a totally bland, maybe even fiber-board, taste experience. To my great surprise, and pleasure, I was blown away by how absolutely great her various concoctions were - chocolate chip cookies, little frosted chocolate cakes, truffles and even chocolate pudding. For the first time in my life I constructed an all-chocolate meal for myself from the samples: appetizer, entree and dessert. Take it from a former, and reformed, Mallomar junkie, her stuff is fabulous and totally taste-competitive with, and in some cases even better than, the chocolate desserts that I had been used to 
 This book should be a must read before someone starts planning a company and then again right before they implement the plan. Many of the mistakes outlined apply to businesses of all sizes, but these mistakes could easily kill a small business. I have seen many of these topics in other books, but this is the most comprehensive. I have introduced this book to a friend who recently had to close his business and he wishes he had this before he ever started.  A MUST REA 
 I really enjoyed the book.  Some of the ideas of the "cavemen mommies" were a little far stretched for me, but overall I really thought it offered some useful advice.  I can't wait for my baby to arrive so I can try the techniques on him 
 The Spanish Bride is the fictionalized history of two very real individuals, Brigade-Major Harry Smith and 14 year old Juana who he rescued and married after the Siege of Badajos. Love at first sight for both of them, the story reads like a novel. It follows them through Wellington's campaigne through Portugal, Spain and southern France. It ends with their reunion on the battlefield after Waterloo.   One of two books dealing with the Napoleonic Wars in which battles are described so accurately they have been used by the English Public School System, Georgette Heyer proved beyond doubt her mastery of historic detail. 
 This is one movie that has aged, and not that well. It was great when it came out (I remember seeing it just after the premiere at the Ziegfield in NYC), but looking at it some 30 years later, it just doesn't stand up to the test of time.   The October 74 run was great, and Deadheads thought it was the last. The film was meant to immortalize the band, and did so. However, Jerry's editing, which puts too much focus on the scene to the detriment of the music, turns the movie into a documentary, rather than a concert film.  But, disc 2 is the real saver. With about 90 minutes of great tunes - and only music - including The Other One, Dark Star, China/Rider, and a great Sugaree, this may be one of the best filmed records of the Dead. Get it for disc 2 
 THIS BOOK IS A "MUST HAVE" FOR ALL EXPECTING MOTHERS (NOT JUST FIRST TIME MOTHERS). IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND ANSWERS MANY QUESTIONS TO EVERYDAY OCCURANCES WITH YOUR BABY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EXPECTING MOTHERS 
 This King James Study Bible is excellent. There is a lot of history about who wrote each book, an outline at the beginning of each book to help find scripture and a breakdown of scripture when necessary.  I have come back to the Lord and this Bible has helped me greatly in my daily Bible study.  It is my opinion that the KJV bible is the true words of the Lord.  I highly recommend this Bible to others seeking the Word of God 
 Sue Hitzmann leads this 30 minute video that keeps you moving from beginning to end.  She is joined by women and men all in great shape, including Faith who shows some beginner modifications.  You start with a fun, simple warmup, one of my favorite parts of the workout, then you head right into boot camp training. You start with squats, then overhead presses for shoulders, then you combine both moves.  You squat down first, then press up, then return to stand.  This was hard!  I was using 8 lb weights and quickly had to drop down to 5's, much harder than it looks.  Then you will do some bent over rows, later adding bicep curls and deadlifts before combining all three moves.  Then it's time for the first set of pushups, you will do 12 traditional pushups before moving on to some ab work.  You start with traditional crunches before adding a foot lift, then you will progress into lifting the entire leg up.  Then you will stand up for some jumping jacks, later adding plyos squats which really ups the heartrate.  Then you will do some forward lunges, these are done with a 3 count pulse, alternating legs, then you will jump switch to the other leg, making it tougher.  This didn't feel comfortable for me so I followed Faith for this part.  More upper body work is next, you will combine hammer curls and angled curls for biceps.  Then you will do one arm angled curls, later adding a plie squat.  You will do one side at a time, then alternate sides.  More pushups follow, you start on the knees, then you lift up and go on to your toes, lower to your knees and repeat, later adding alternating glute lifts. Quite challenging.   Then you stand for some standing ab work, knee smashes are the best way to describe them, you will do one side first, then the other before alternating sides.  I liked this move a lot.  The next segment is calf raises/rear lunges.  You will start with calf raises, then add rear lunges alternating legs.  Then you will do more alternating rear lunges, then one side at a time while adding a knee lift, leg extension and a tricep press.  Then you will work the triceps more with a set of double arm kickbacks, then repeat the rear lunge sequence on the other leg.  More tricep kickbacks and french presses complete this segment.    The next segment starts with a move called "Tap & Touch".  You shift all your weight on one leg, while the other leg taps front and back.  Then you will do the "Skate & Slide", which is self explanatory, later you will add a knee lift, before moving into hops with your knees up high, you will start slowly then go into double time before jogging it out.  Next you will do more shoulder work, starting with rear delt raises and high rows, then you will repeat the Tap/Touch and Skate/Slide sequence on the other side.  More shoulder work follows, starting with a T cross which is a front raise, extension to the side and lowering the arms down, then you will finish with side lateral raises.  You finish out with one more set of pushups, these really target the triceps as your hands are placed more narrow.  Here you combine a 2-2 and single count for a few sets.  Then you will finish with more ab work, this time reverse crunches later adding some arms that actually help execute the move better, then you will move into double crunches before finishing with a brief set of leg pulleys.  Then it's time to stretch.  This workout packs a lot into 30 minutes, and I really felt liked I worked.  Great for days you don't have a lot of time but want a decent workout.  Sue is the perfect instructor for this video, she is friendly and encouraging but to the point. I liked her.  Overall this is one of the better Crunch sculpting workouts I have tried, I felt it was thorough in hitting all the muscle groups, plus there was a lot of variety.  Recommended

 Like her former partner Robert A. Johnson, Helen Luke is a master of rendering the psychological meanings in great literature understandable and relevant to all people wishing to gain a deeper level of understanding about the growtn of the human soul.  Having plumbed the depths of her own psycho-spiritual aging process(Such Stuff As Dreams are Made On), Ms. Luke has created a work fusing literary scholarship and personal experience into a guide for all of us to follow towards the inevitable. When the time comes for me to plant my oar (read her interpretation of The Odyssey)and turn towards the life of prayer, song and storytelling I will be eternally grateful to have had this wonderful Wise Woman as my guide.

 I had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up...but after a little tweaking, it works beautifully.  Previously owned regular CRT...what an improvement!  Superb clarity and brightness.  For the money you just can't go wrong with this one 
 Firestarter will make you very angry. Firestarter will make you very sad. It's a clinic in shameful government abuses and a lesson in parental devotion. It's a glimpse at the hidden powers of the mind, and a treatise on the atrocities committed by men who hunger for power. Stephen King should not be able to jam so much inside a story and still make it keep a reader up until dawn. But Stephen King is Stephen King and that's what he does. In Firestarter, as with The Dead Zone, he empowers his characters with powerful abilities and then exploits those abilities from every angle. A little girl who can ignite infernos through simple thought should not be restrained in a fictional work. King does not restrain her. Young Charlie runs amok and as a reader, you'll be very glad she did. For every house that burns, every car that blows up and every evil G-man that runs shrieking in flames, our little protagonists has amble motivation. Her father can manipulate another person's thoughts just by thinking real hard. A man such as this should not be hidden in a back room to do mere parlor tricks. King does not whittle away Daddy's powers. Daddy uses them much as you would if someone locked you up and tried to steal your daughter. Firestarter is an outright grabber from start to finish. King has created some vividly evil entities through the years, but few so detestable as the men and women who make up The Shop. It is a sublevel government agency aimed at mowing down children and families in the ultimate race for world supremacy. Though he doesn't flout his research skills, King no doubt studied up on the CIA's experiments with mind control and chemical manipulations as he prepared to write this thriller. It's another fantastic tale that may be closer to fact than we want to believe 
 To me, this book was the most entertaining and best written of the first three books of the Aubrey/Maturin series.  The book covers a journey to and from India, with an exciting battle sequence and a primer on early 19th century Bombay in the middle.  The book is not an action thriller, but it has thrilling action.  It is not a romance novel, but there are definitely romantic moments.  And it is not a travel book, but you certainly do enjoy being taken along for the ride.      While the battle sequence is the most exciting part of the book, what I appreciated the most was the description of sea life on the long and tedious journey to India.  O'Brian's writing on the sailors daily lives and of the challenges of a long journey at the time is so authentic and well written that you really do feel like you're along for the ride with the characters.  I definitely found myself more "lost" within the book while reading H.M.S. Surprise than I did while reading the first two installments of the series.  A warning, though, that while H.M.S. Surprise would probably hold up well if read as a stand alone book, it is clearly intended to be part of a larger series and should be read that way.  I cannot imagine enjoying the story nearly as much if I had not read Master and Commander and Post Captain first.  
 I'm way over the age of 13, but I just loved this book.  Interesting story and characters that I enjoyed spending time with 
 I had to read City People for my history class in college this year. I have never been much of a history buff (the only reason the course was taken was because it was required), but I have to say I was fairly impressed with this book. It's full of information, which is all organized quite nicely and very easy to find with just the chapter titles, and though it goes into almost too much details now and again, keeps the language easy to understand without making it feel Barth is "talking down" to you. I'd definately reccomend this book, whether you're a "history-oriented" person or not 
 The book does a fair analysis of all elements of the NT.  He either states conflicting views in the body of the text or in the footnotes and/or bibliography before he states his opinion.  After reading this book one would be well prepared to take on the interpretive commentary on the New Testament by an authoritative source since no attempt is made in this work to provide religious education - merely the best historical analyses possible with information available to date 
 I've read this book countless times now. It is w/o a doubt my favorite read. I own 2 hardcopies and I've just ordered more paperbacks to give out as gifts. At $4.99 it is a steal. 
 I found this a long time ago in a bargain bin for $2.  I *love* this book--it's one of my all-time favorite books.  Although I haven't put up a tree in years, it's now a tradition to read this book every year.  It puts me in the Christmas spirit--and adds realism, proof and perspective to the Christmas mission.  Buy it and make your own family tradition.  
 As far as my opinion goes this is my favorite Pink Floyd album. I am a huge fan and like all their music but this one is just amazing. It also seems unfair how under appreciated this album is. It may not have that one huge hit as some of the other albums had, but this one is classic Floyd. Must have for any fan of classic rock music 
 This is my second Hiaasen novel after reading the sensational novel Sick Puppy and this was just as enjoyable.  Hiaasen has a knack for novels where the stupid an immoral get their comeuppance and the reader gets lots of laughs and satisfaction along the way.  I'm going straight to the bookstore and getting another Hiaasen novel as soon as I've finished this review, he's that good!  JoLayne Lucks works as a vet in a small Florida town called Grange.  Grange's town folk are a bit eccentric and not opposed to conning passing travellers to stop by and see their Madonna statue weep, the oil stain Jesus or marvel at the electric drilled hand and foot holes that are supposed to be a mark of the crucifixion.  JoLayne couldn't be more opposite, she turned down a higher paying career in hospitals to help out animals and recently rescued 45 turtles from land which was going to be turned into a shopping mall. One day she wins the lottery, unfortunately so do a couple of redneck low IQ'd  racists who can not see any reason why they should have to split their winnings, so after a violent assault take JoLayne's ticket as well.  Accompanied by a disillusioned journalist JoLayne is determined to get the ticket back before it is cashed in.  What follows is a fast paced adventure through the state of Florida where you'll laugh and smile as various con artists, corrupt officials and others get what they so richly deserve. 
 Once again, Sesame Workshop (or Children's Television Workshop as I like to still think of it) and Shout Factory came up with the goods for another winning DVD box set of The Electric Company.  Heads-up warning: If you are expecting to see a PBS logo at the end of the 1975 documentary shot entirely on film showing teachers' employment of the show in the classroom, there isn't one.  Strange, and I was told this was a prime-time special for PBS.  The PBS I.D. logo was added to the master tapes of just about everything they distributed to their member stations.  But it still appears at the end of the episodes, just like on the previous DVD box set.  Judy Graubart's (Jennifer Of The Jungle) hair has colored considerably since the series' final show in 1977.  Jim Boyd (J. Arthur Crank, Paul The Gorilla, voice of Lorelei The Chicken) doesn't appear to have aged too much, even with sporting eyeglasses now.  Skip Hinnant (Fargo North, Decoder) has gray hair at 66, but his voice still sounds like it did during the series' run.  He had about the same hair color I do when he was my current age of 35.  There are 40 episodes officially released on DVD now, another 740 to go until the whole series is covered.  I really do hope this DVD box set does as well as the first one did to warrant a third volume DVD box set, and many others after that.  That next set should include interviews with Lee Chamberlin, Bill Cosby, Morgan Freeman, Melanie Henderson (Kathy of The Short Circus), Stephen Gustafson (Buddy of The Short Circus).  A side note to the New Jersey educator that reviewed the first DVD box set; I did find the PBS logo bumper with its Moog synthesizer theme a bit scary when I was a kid.  Looking at it in my maturity, it's still a bit scary to me but also exciting at the same time.  Signed, David (B. Gill's son 
 To put it as simple as possible, Tender is the Night is the story of a man and woman in a codependent relationship. She needs him for stability and he needs her to feel useful. A relationship like this is unhealthy, therefore, it can't last. But the two involved are the last to know.  The story starts off with the actress Rosemary, not the principle characters Dick and Nicole. This is done for a reason. Fitzgerald wants us as the reader to be introduced to the couple the way the world would. We're supposed to see Dick and Nicole as the glamorous, sophisticated couple who are rich and happy--hence, from the outside. Only as time goes by do we see them for the flawed individuals and disturbing couple they are. Dick loses himself in his attempt to be the rock to his emotionally and mentally disturbed wife. I'm still not sure how medically accurate it is for a woman to become a schizophrenic due to incest. But I digress.  Tender is the Night isn't as breezy as The Great Gatsby: it is more complex and longer; yet, it's not as good. Some of the characters here remind me of the empty, vacuous characters of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises: the so called "lost generation" who spend their time traveling and cavorting across Europe drinking and licking their emotional wounds while enjoying their expatriate status in the more "sophisticated" countries. Only, Tender is the Night is much meatier and more thoroughly enjoyable than Hemingway's drudgery.  Bottom Line: A thinly veiled autobiography of Fitzgerald that fails to be a masterpiece, but is still a worthy piece of work that I wouldn't be opposed to reading again 
 This book is about two men who share a prison cell.  One is a gay man in for 'corruption of youth' and the other is a political activist.  Most of the book is the conversations between these two and one of the men telling the other the plots to movies, as a way to pass the time.  About midway through, the author begins to place pages-long footnotes on various subjects and these perplexed me a bit. I felt a bit like this book would make english teachers drool at the mouth because of the subtle undertones of emotion in the prisoners and also the strange footnotes 
 Although Cassandra Wilson has been doin' her thing for decades, somehow she still never seemed to get the popularity as other great female jazz vocalists have gotten. Still, Cassandra came back and made her latest album Thunderbird a disc of mostly covers. And she did it very well.  Like another legendary soulful songstress, Etta James, did on her latest (cover) album Let's Roll, Cassandra also chose not to necessarily do all soul songs, but rock songs with soul updates. This is especially shown on Jakob Dylan's "Closer to You". But Ms. Wilson also does well on traditional pieces, like "Red River Valley" and "Easy Rider". Original songs like "Tarot" and "Poet" further impress.  There isn't anything bad to say about this album, except that maybe people will probably wish there was more, considering it's a mere ten tracks in length. Then again, it's short and sweet, which makes it all the more entertaining. Cop it.  Anthony Ruper 
 Overall, I liked this book. The chapters were short and easy to read.  I liked the fact that it contained a lot of cases.  However, I wish the author had included some analysis to get the reader started 
 You'll find this to be an excellent treatise on VaR that appeals to the risk professional as well as the academic.  Concepts are clearly explained as well as how best to apply VaR techniques.  It comes in handy when you need to explain VaR nuances to your boss or the head of the trading desk.  
 I must say that this album impressed me very well. Truly, how I heard of them before, was when a concert was on and me and my sister were just chillin' and we flipped through channels while she folded our laundry and we came across vh1 and noticed 'The Corrs Concert'. I don't quite remember where they were performing, but it was remarkable. We heard 'Breathless' and it touched us. I don't know why, I don't know how, but I loved it! Shortly me and my sister had an arugement over who was going to get all of their CDs, and all of a sudden, the short obsession ended. No news whatsoever in this house about them for like, what? 2 years, maybe? Anyways, I was at Media Play the other day with my fam, dad, and both bros. I was flippin' through CDs and I came across the Corrs, I was in awe and I flipped through the CDs. In happiness I gradully decided The Corrs over Michelle Branch. Thanks to that, I'm happy, now! I bought it and it is fantastic! I thought 'Breathless' would be the only song I liked, but I was wrong. 'Say', 'Give Me A Reason', and 'Radio' are excellent! 'All The Love In The World' sort of sounds like a cheesy show cartoon but it actually turns out really well. The album is great, I suggest buying it immdietly 
 I have been using Cindy Crawfords tapes since 1993. I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever.  My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.You cannot help but like her.  New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results. New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time. Please enjoy !!!!!! 
 This is one of Christie's best later works and it shows she can still weave intricate plots and characters together with effective ease. Great atmosphere and story, with Poirot popping up almost toward the end. You'll never see any of the final threads coming. Perhaps her most entertaining book of the 1950's 
 I read this book as an assignment, and I read it before anybody else in my grade. I fell in love with the book, it's a real page turner! It makes you want to keep reading. And since I read it before anyone else, I read it again; and again in my classroom!  In other words,Highly Recommended 
 To date, I think I own about four different copies of Whitman's grand opus "Leaves of Grass". One is a deathbed edition, printed in 1922, that is hardcover yet pocket sized and great for a backpack. The second is an 1855 reprint of a "first edition" sold by a major bookstore chain. The third is another 1855 reprint in paperback. And now the fourth, which is this one, and without a doubt, the best of the bunch!  Walt Whitman, throughout his years, wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass many times, for each subsequent reprint. Much of the later editions of the book become watered down and less potent, according to editor Gary Schmidgall, of which I heartily agree. The final "deathbed" edition of Leaves of Grass, released around the time of Whit's death, varies tremendously from the rich dance of the first edition, in fact, the first three editions.   After reading Schmidgall's amazing book, "Walt Whitman: A Gay Life", you come quickly appreciate Whitman's 1860 edition of the book, the third, released just before the Civil War. Upon searching for a copy of this book, it's virtually hard to find, and I ended up downloading some of the poetry off the Whitman archives website. But Schmidgall painstakingly has recreated that edition, rebuilding such moving sections of the book like Calamus.   It's in Schmidgall's edition that the true genius of Whitman comes alive. He becomes more real, more in depth, and shows more pain than in any other edition I've read. It's too bad that Whit decided to censor his writings as he aged, for he tends to weed out the roses with the dandelions. Schmidgall replants Whitman's glorious garden, and we, as readers, get to reap the visual brilliance of it all 
 This DVD collection includes the classic 30-minute story, plus two stories from the Chipmunks TV series.  The 25th Anniversay set also includes an audio CD with the most popular Chipmunks Christmas songs.  It's great to own a classic I can share with generations to come.  
 I am hopeful that Katie Holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a Stepford wife for her couch-jumping husband-to-be. It's not that she strikes me as all that brilliant, but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as April Burns, a rebellious twenty-something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family's upstate home to a tenement in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Encouraged by her new boyfriend Bobby (who happens to be black), she invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment. There is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst-driven mother is dying of breast cancer, and this may be their last meal together  Directed and written by Peter Hedges (who wrote the equally eccentric "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"), the story bounces back and forth between April's hazard-ridden preparation of the meal and the Burns family's chaotic journey to the city. While the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year's "Little Miss Sunshine", April's adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors, all strangers at first, to borrow a working stove for her turkey. Among others, she runs into a friendly black couple, an obsessive vegan and an elderly Chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday. On top of this is an odd, racially-driven storyline involving Bobby's need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters.  Shot in digital video by Tami Reiker and running only eighty minutes, the 2003 movie works toward an inevitable conclusion, but Hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be. Among the supporting cast, Patricia Clarkson stands out as April's mother Joy, bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface. Oliver Platt is terrific as her put-upon husband Jim, as are Derek Luke as Bobby and Allison Pill as April's "perfect" little sister Beth. In little more than cameos which could have been excised, Sean Hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog, while Dru Hill's Sisqo plays Bobby's friend Latrell. Hedges provides a nice commentary track on the 2004 DVD, which also includes a fifteen-minute making-of featurette 
 If you shy away from Victorian novels because you had to read A TALE OF TWO CITIES in high school, it is time to give these treasures another try.  Admit it, you are a bit older now.  So are these books by Dickens, Disraeli, Thackary, Austen, the Bronte sisters, and, yes, my personal favorite, the great man himself, Anthony Trollope.    Why read something that was written a century and a half ago?  Because Trollope knew more about the human psyche than Freud and Jung put together, and wrote about it not with a clinician's jaundiced eye, but with incredible tenderness and love.  And entertainingly, to boot!  If you have been reading the Jan Karon novels about life in a small North Carolina highlands town, as it revolves around an Episcopal priest named Father Tim and his colorful parishioners, well!--this is where it all began.  A book version of finding the source of the Nile.    Trollope began what Karon has revised and restyled so engagingly.  Trollope invented the "church and town" novel, with what have become known as his Bartchester Series of novels, all centering around the doings of a fictitious cathedral town and its outlying countryside.  Not the first in the series, (it is the fourth but perhaps the best), FRAMLEY PARSONAGE traces the faith, home and political lives of a number of intertwining families.  Here you will find love, ambition, political maneuvering, gambling debts, pretension, humility, envy, forgiveness, hate, romance.  If it sounds like a slice of modern life-it is.  We and the Victorians are so much alike; the human condition does not change.  In this delightful mix of clerical, political and romantic intrigue, you will meet everyone from the alarmingly meddlesome bishop's wife, Mrs. Proudie, to the original dizzy blond, Griselda Grantly.  All set in the green countryside and the bustling streets of London.  The story centers around the bright, popular pastor, Mark Robarts and his charming wife, but it is his sister, Lucy, who will capture your heart as perhaps the loveliest of heroines in any novel.  I hope you are intrigued enough to be convinced that there is more to Nineteenth Century British Literature than SILAS MARNER.  Moreover, I hope you will read this and the other Trollope works.  You may recall that in addition to being one of the most successful and acclaimed novelist of all times, Trollope was also a successful and acclaimed civil servant-his "day job" was with the British postal system-he invented the corner mailbox.  His more than 40 novels and outstanding autobiography were written in his very disciplined "spare time" in which he produced a specific number of pages every morning before departing punctually for his office.  Not only a genius of time management, Trollope was and is a guardian of the human heart.    What?  You say you would rather start at the beginning of the Bartchester series?  By all means!  But if you do not, try FRAMLY PARSONAGE first.  Dip your toe in there-for you cannot dip your toe into any of his books without emerging the better, having done so.  If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction. 
 While in Sephora planning to buy Fantasy By Britney Spears I came across the Armani Code. It was kinda hard to miss since there was this GIGANTIC Poster advertising it. So I thought there's no harm testing it right?? I sprayed a little bit on a test strip and fell IN LOVE with it. It smells amazing!!!! It mainly smells like Lavendar to me which is one of my favorite scent. It lasts for about maybe 4 hours so if you go to school or work you might need 1 or 2 refreshes. I spray about 2 squirts each. Also on the days that you want to try something different I recommand the Pink Sugar by Aquolina and Miracle Intense by Lancome 
 This book is very influential. When i first read the book i figured out that as i read it the message of the story was thereare no limits to learning and when you do the power of reading and knowledge will be so strong that it will seem as if you had superpowers. I learned that there is no limit to learning and no matter how hard i seems to real your goals go for it. The style of the book is diction. As Mathilda is a little girl growing up she finds out she has a major interest for books wile her family spends their time watching T.V. She has a powerful mind and finds out she can move things telepathically. I dont need to tell you the ending because you can read it yourself 
 I'm not giving anything away here.  Just wanted to say that this book was still enchanting the second time around.  I read it the first time when I was a teenager, and now in my 30s I have re-read it and have fallen in love again.  Well written, endearing, truly a classic 
 Writer Donald Ritchie, an expert on Japanese film and a keen observer of that interesting country, has distilled nearly sixty years of life as an expatriate into these fascinating journals.  Ritchie emerges as a deep thinker and lover of high culture who derives equal satisfaction from indulging his "taste for the mud" (it sounds much more poetic in French), which takes him to sex clubs, prostitutes, and other similarly disreputable places for which he holds a healthy admiration.  His endless curiosity about matters and people both high and low is a strong point of this book, providing a well-rounded portrait of both a society and a man's life.  I enjoyed seeing Japan through Ritchie's eyes from his first days in the country during the American occupation up through the years of reconstruction, the boom years of the 80s, and the bursting of the bubble.  He notes the many changes in the people and is quite honest about his own feelings concerning his privileged position as a foreigner, never fully accepted but also not subject to the same severe social strictures to which Japanese hold each other.  Among the many highlights of this fine book are the long train trip across the country that Ritchie takes during the days of the occupation, his friendship with Yukio Mishima as well as many other distinguished people, and his closely observed opinions on the evolution of Japan's stance toward the foreigner.  A fine read, particularly recommended to those with an interest in Japan. 
 One of the best, if not THE best, albums Thelonious Monk recorded during his time with Columbia Records, "Straight No Chaser" found Monk is his long-standing working quartet (tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse, bassist Larry Gales, and drummer Ben Riley) in fine form.   Recorded in three sessions during 1966 and 1967, the album ended up being six tracks, three of which had to be edited down to squeeze it on an LP (and at 51 minutes, it evidentally required some "clever engineering" to do so).  Well one of the nice things about CDs is the capacity to not be limited by twenty-something minute side lengths, and when reissuing this, the decision was made to restore the pieces to their original performances as well as augumenting the session with two tracks recorded during the session but not used (one-- "This is My Story - This is My Song"-- ended up on "Always Know", but the other is wholly unreleased) and an alternate take of one piece from the record.  So what makes "Straight, No Chaser" so good?  It seems as if the band and the leader were highly inspired-- Monk dug out a couple of originals that rarely see the light of day ("Locomotive" and "We See", both not recorded in over a decade) and both receive great readings.  "Locomotive" seems to excel by Monk's brilliant accompaniment below Rouse, but it's Gales and Riley who steal the show, showing just how far this quartet has come in the couple years they'd been playing together.  "We See" receives an extended workout with a chirping, positively ecstatic theme forcing Rouse in the extreme upper register before turning over to an extended solo by him that maintains a pretty much constant dialog with Monk at the keyboard before turning the preceedings over to Monk who takes a brilliant, fractured solo of seemingly endless inventiveness.  The standards performed were also not the usual ones in Monk's catalog-- Ellington's "I Didn't Know About You" receives a remarkably sensitive reading, with Monk and Rouse particularly lyrics while Gales offers delicate counter to Monk's accompaniment of the tenor.  The piece originally titled "Japanese Folk Song" was a Japanese pop song from the '30s called "Kojo No Tsuki" (which the liner notes speculate Monk may have heard on a then-recent tour of Japan) that receives an extended workout-- totally sucked into the Monk idiom, it sounds as if it could be a Monk original with its angular sound and bizarrely lyrical sensibility.  Rouse again solos to great effect, pushed on by the rhythm section-- Monk eventually drops out and lets Gales and Riley show just how tight the interaction of this band was, even without the leader.  And yet it can't be the unusualness of the material that was inspiring-- the band certainly digs in deep on the title track-- one of Monk's best known pieces gets a fierce rendition, with Rouse positively on fire and both Gales and Riley taking brilliant solos.  The bonus material is equally valuable-- standard "This is My Story, This is My Song" is a lovely, brief piano statement of the theme, with minimal improvisation (except in phrasing) that feels like exactly what you need after the hard blowing "We See".  The alternate of "I Didn't Know About You" is curious because it's really quite good, and it's hard to say why Monk rejected it-- nonetheless, it provides a nice second rendition of the piece.  But it's "Green Chimneys" that's probably most interesting.  A never-before recorded composition, it was decided to withold this performance (although Monk must have thought highly of it as he tried again on the next LP he cut for Columbia).  The piece features an arhythmic line phrased first by piano then in harmony with the tenor.  While both Rouse and Monk song a bit tentative on the theme statement, Rouse's soloing is superb and it works to be a nice performance.  One thing deserving note is the liner notes-- Riverside Records producer Orrin Keepnews, who wrote the liner notes for the original album and produced the reissue, includes both his original essay and a set of new notes about the restoration of the album.  The album sounds to have been remastered, but it isn't quite as good sounding as the remasters from 2001 that CBS/Sony did, it'd be nice if this one got the 24-bit remastering treatment at some point.    This album may be a bit of a dense place to start with Monk-- it IS a bit long winded, but his records rarely got better.  Highly recommended 
 It's the most comprehensive, all-inclusive 596-page volume with information on healthy living - nutrition, control of emotions, excercise. There are great chapters on Relaxation, Yoga, Sex, and much more! Great, rejuvenating, life-saving reference material for any man - young or old 
 This book bring us statistics in a simple way, begining with easy exercises and increasing them to hard tasks. I have tried a lot of diferent books, some of them in Portuguese, and this was the only one that is realy  good enough to teach us without a tutor or professor.  It brings the most  important parts of statistics for Business and Economics using exercises  that talk about real cases and real hypothesis testing. It was easer to  learn from this book than to do it in my own language 
 This prequel to Through a Glass Darkly does not disappoint.  If you like Charles II and the period of The Restoration, you'll love this book.  The character of Alice Verney is intelligent, charming, controlling, manipulative and sympathetic.  She is fiercely loyal to those she loves and unforgiving to many.  Through her story the reader learns a great deal about the personal and political history of King Charles - the tragedy, the whimsy and the fascinating people that orbit his sphere.  Great book.  Highly recommended. 
 Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a year or so it had fallen to the back of his preference list. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.. but it did last a year or more.  I would recommend this for young children. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent or inappropriate. The movie is mostly an original concept but there are striking similarities to Antz. Overall a GREAT movie for the whole family 
 As a pharmacy student, I found the Washington Manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options, as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories.  This is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment.  This book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state, but rather focuses on the causes, measurements and treatments.  My only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics, is considered old 
 I'm as low tech as they come. I needed a firewire port so I could upload from my digital video camera. I had no idea what I was doing. I got the specs for the card from my computer manufacturer. I followed the directions that came with the card. It took me all of five minutes to install and I haven't had any problem with it. Yay 
 An excellent ending to the trilogy. Fast-paced without sacrificing characterisation, and a satisfying end to the conundrum of Nathaniel. A great deal has been made of the character of Bartimaeus, the wise-cracking djinn; this volume maintains the level of his characterisation, and adds some affecting glimpses of his past with the eponymous Ptolemy. However, the chilly, complex Nathaniel, and his tentative, developing relationship with Kitty Jones the revolutionary, which tracks and depends on his tentative, developing relationship with his own conscience, is what gives the climax its poignancy. It adds an important dimension to the human protagonists' actions that, as Stroud occasionally reminds us, they are still only adolescents, cast into roles and situations that would tax full-fledged and experienced adults. 
 Saw the final stop of the tour on Maui.  Kenny and Jimmy still have it...boy do they!  This CD delivers.  Great songs...voices...the band was killer.  If you missed this tour you blew it.  But now you can get this CD AND a DVD of Loggins & Messina in Santa Barbara.  Get it....just for Trilogy and Same Old Wine...worth the dough just for those.  I hope the guys keep at it.  They sound way too good to end it now 
 My 16-month old daughter loves this video.  She has already started trying to follow along with the steps.  It's hysterical!  It is wonderfully multi-ethnic, and introduces many different genres of dance.  This is one video that I don't mind my little one insisting on watching several times a day.  I love it too 
 I decided to purchase Da lench Mob's "Planet of the Apes" back in 1992, not because I knew who they were, but when I browsing through the Hip-Hop section, I saw that Ice Cube had produced this CD, and I thought I give it a shot. Not only was that appealing, there were 3 guys on the back of the album cover with full fledge ski mask's on, I and thought, man this album is going to be hard as hell. The album didn't dissapoint. Not only was the album hard as hell (the opening track starts off with a hard beat and some guy talking about execution styles used) but the group showed some real talent on the mic. This would be a short lived project, as Da Lench Mob only stuck around for another album, yet this is one that Hip-Hop fans shouldnt let pass by. Even though its been 14yrs since its release, its still classic "Hardcore" Hip-Hop, and I cant reccomend it enough to people that are fans of the genre. ENJO 
 I really wish that there were more Diana Tregarde books.  Since they are being reprinted after so many years, can I possibly hope for more?   Soon?  The setting and tone of this book differs dramatically from that of "Burning Water."  In this book, Di is back on her own turf.  Readers see more of her past, which makes her character even more interesting.  Instead of purposely walking into trouble, trouble finds her. Throw in 3 types of vampires, can you go wrong?  The third book is Jinx High, which is also scheduled to be re-released by Tor.  
 I remember when this film came out in the theater when I was a kid.  I never saw it in the theater but I watched it several times on VHS.  I enjoyed this film greatly.  It is one of my favorites.  Elliot and Ross have great chemistry.  The ending was solid, and left room for a sequel but I have not heard of one, unless it was released on Beta Max like the fabled Sentinel Sequel.  I am a big fan of horror movies from this error where story was more important than gore and dazzle.  I give this movie a solid 4 stars it is one of my favorites.  Almost forgot about this one.  But it may be too slow for everyone 
 A very well organised book in all. A must have for the student and the professional engineer 
 I never realized, when I began reading about the Nag Hammadi scroll discoveries, that there were so many divergent opinions about them, and about their relevance to Christianity as it is practiced today. It appears that even the Biblical "experts" cannot agree on a dating for many of these items, and this author takes the position that much of the dating is based, not upon research, but upon the preconceived religious leanings of the dater. I'm just a layman, and this is all very confusing to me, because I am reading about these things purely from a historical point of view, rather than a religious or political position. There seems to be a chasm between the "liberals" and the "conservatives" in the field, with the former arguing for earlier dates which would put the documents much closer to the time of Jesus, while the latter say they were composed much later, after the Church was already fairly well organized. I don't know which group is correct, but I do enjoy a good debate, and this book certainly provides one. I look forward to reading more works on this most interesting subject 
 I bought 3 tax lien books at a real estate bookshop/workshop and I would rate this tax lien book as #2 out of the three (see my other reviews on what else I bought).  I think this book was a good introduction to tax liens but there's a few things that were in it that I didn't give it 5 full stars.  Good - ** The back reference materials is probably the most helpful out of this book, specifically the directory of states and their laws.    Bad -  ** I don't really like the tell-all stories of the author's auction escapades...I want to read a how-to book, I really don't want to know the person you corrected because what he said was wrong when you overheard him.  I don't really want to see pictures of you and your friends at the auction.  Conclusion ** Overall a 4 out of 5 stars, but please remove some of the autobiography stuff next time 
 This is very much in the WitchWorld Tradition.  It goes very well with the series 
 This is the sixth volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series, and focusses on the War of 1812 - although less than a third of the way through the series, we are now getting quite late in the Napoleonic Wars.  The story continues the same voyage from 'Desolation Island', and the events and characters of that book are significant.  So it's advisable to read that prior to this, even if you don't read all of the five prequels.  Two naval battles and a desperate longboat voyage are featured, but the heart of the story is Aubrey and Maturin as POWs in Boston, where Maturin's past spying activities are coming back to haunt him.  This part of the story is done very well.  The principal complaint is one that applies to all the books in this series, so at least readers will be used to it by now.  The books are loaded with contemporary naval terms and slang which O'Brian never stops to explain, leaving the reader to spend almost as much time at sea as the heroes.  The series is generally strong on historical authenticity, but an earlier revewer complains that this volume is an exception.  I suspect that is so; from my own knowledge of the War of 1812, the close Franco-American alliance which is portrayed in this book, while it would have made political sense, never really existed.  Such errors are unfortunate in an author who normally avoids them, but they didn't spoil the story for me 
 I've always been interested in this subject, but could never find enough information on the evolution of the English language. Thank god for this book, it is full, and has writing samples from different time periods and places, as well as back stories that tell when the language changed 
 This is a great Bible.  I love this translation because it's very readable and it just seems to connect with me better when I'm reading for myself.  I wouldn't reccomend this for hard study, but that's not the reason I gave it four stars.  I understood that this Bible is a paraphrase and is made specifically for readability and not for in depth study.  The reason that I gave it four stars was because it is so small.  Yes, I read that it was a compact Bible, but I didn't read the dimensions of it.  I expected something about the same size as a gift bible, about 12 in. tall and 8 in. wide.  Contrary from what the picture led me to think, is indeed a pocket bible; it fits into my pocket easily.  So, if you have reading problems, this is probably not the Bible for you, but if you're able and just want a small, readable bible to carry around, this one is great 
 Although this isnt Sonic Youths best album, its still cool to see where they started. Its hard to believe that this band would be the same band to release "Daydream Nation" five years later. This album might be a little too weird for some people, but despite what most reviewers have said I enjoyed this on my first listen. Even though the songs have no structure, they are still cool to listen to. The best songs would have to be "Inhuman" and "Confusion is Next". Ive never heard anything quite like this album before. 
 I had to buy this book when my friend Nikki Shearer-Tilford told me that the story she wrote, I am My Sister's Keeper, had been published in this book. I read her story first, which I knew would be insightful and really touch my heart so deeply that I wanted to read more of her stories. I started reading the other stories and I felt good that we as African Americans can share our experiences so that the other cultures will have a better understanding of who we are as a people. We as a people have suppressed our emotions and feelings for so many centuries for fear of retribution by the dominant culture that the stories gave me a sense of joy and love to be able to finally write about our experiences on how we continue to overcome every day. Now we must share these stories with our children to strengthen them and show them the path that God has ordained for all of his children who step out on faith no matter where the road leads. I'm purchasing another book for a young lady I know who is feeling the pain and of others who are suffering and she doesn't know how to help them. I think the stories will encourage her and renew her faith in God 
 The most detailed book on bicycle repair I have ever seen. Even though it is written for professionals, the detailed step-by-stem procedures leave nothing to assumption. All procedures are covered by detailed worksheets  which you are encouraged to photocopy and use as a guide through the  repair. The illustrations are great. Details, worksheets, and illustrations  make this book very user friendly, even though it's target audience appears  to be professionals 
 I've bought this book so many times for my friends.  It's the first book I've read that actually gives simple techniques for changing complicated behavior.  And it addresses those that say they are okay with everything but don't realize how it builds inside.  It also addresses those of us who let everyone have it, but never resolve anything -- now maybe people will really listen.  Whether you're angry or not and whether you're male or female -- this book has techniques that anyone can put to use 
 There are real nuggets of divine wisdom in this classic. My only concern is his very heavy animosity towards the world. His spiritual insights are rewarding, but I am (currently) a strong believer of being *in* the world but not *of* the world viz "Passionately loving the World" by St. Josemaria Escriva. I can still temper or filter his animosity to mine some real spiritual gems 
    When I compared the Table of Contents with that of the 2000 edition, I could not find any changes in section titles of page numbering.     Whereas most Style Guides are written for reference, rather than for reading from cover to cover, this Handbook is an extremely readable tutorial for "new and aspiring copyeditors who will be working on nonfiction books, journal articles ... and corporate publications" -- and it comes complete with exercises and answers. There's also a side-by-side comparison of light, medium and heavy copyediting of a sample text.     In addition to useful practical guidelines for paper-based editing, there are also useful guidelines for using word processor redlining to highlight changes in computer-based edits.     It covers practical, perennial questions like "How can you reliably estimate completion dates, i.e. what's a reasonable workload in terms of pages per hour?"  "When should you query the writer, and how can you write more effective queries?"     I have two main criticisms about this book.  One is that the type is small and rather faint -- maybe it is the poor quality of the paper?  The other is that the title of the book is inappropriate -- this is not just a book for copyeditors;  it is also a "must read" for technical writers and technical translators.  But that is not so much a criticism as a compliment.  
 If you are looking for a book with a twist and humor this is the one.  I have read it many times and it still is fun and new each time...MUST HAVE BOOK 
 James comes through again. A real page turner. Andrew Gross picked a winner to collab with 
 While this is a reprint of an older story of Evanovich it still holds together nicely. A fun, light heart read that is timeless.  It's setting in Williamsburg helps a lot.  Bunnies, babies, a fun guy and a soft heart gal what's not to like. Read it when it was first printed and the reprint was just a good.  Buy it. I did twice 
 This is a remarkable quartet, singing with purity and style, from the haunting to the merry, medieval chant to modern settings of Celtic religious texts.  Where there are arrangements, they are lovely and the instrumental pieces are simple and beautiful.  This is the first time I have heard this group of women, and I am enchanted.  It's a cappella at its very best: look to your laurels, King's Singers and Chanticleer, here come the ladies 
 "The book has so much action you can't flip the pages fast enough to keep up" 
 This is an outstanding compilation of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, however, you could probably piece together another 20 songs or so of Bad Seeds material and create a compilation just as strong if not stronger. Nick Cave is an outstanding songwriter and sings with a great dark and deadpan delivery. My only disappointment with this band is that Blixa Bargeld's influence is minimal which has always made me wonder why he joined the band to begin with other than to probably pick up a steady paycheck.... The Best Of is well worth the price especially if you're new to the band 
 Find out which expensive beauty products are worth their hefty price tag, and which aren't.  This book will help you sort through it all 
 My grandson loves this walker.  He is not yet able to walk but he sits in the seat and loves the music and lights 
 This would have to be one of the best albums I've ever bought. Amon Tobin is a genius with a techno-jazz hybrid sound. I adore the first 4 tracks on this album, as with the first 4 tracks on Bricolage, which has a slightly darker sound than Supermodified. Similarly to Bricolage, Supermodified becomes more abstract the further in you listen, which can be considered either good or bad, depending on your own musical tastes. However, I'm not a huge fan of abstract down-tempo, but I am still able to consider this one of my favourite albums 
 The astonishing double negative of "God Don't Never Change," with its existential contradiction, sums up why this collection should be in the home of every gospel music lover in the world. Johnson's songs encompass the entire spectrum of spiritual experience from despair to hope to acceptance to mystical transcendence. & he leaves no doubt that he's been through all of it. Inspired by God's love, these songs, the singing, the guitar playing, are absolutely revelatory. Of course, Blind Willie Johnson is listened to mostly in the spirit of dispassionate appreciation by blues afficionados. Believers will have that plus the added pleasure of knowing what's really going on here. "Everybody Ought To Treat a Stranger Right" takes sound Gospel advice & makes it a request for spare change. "John the Revelator" kicks like rock & roll. "God moves on the water," indeed 
 This cd is the first from the gothic duo Nox Arcana.  And it tells the story of cursed mansion that brings woe and death to all who dwell within.  The music is sinister, enticing, and darkly inviting.  Almost like a temptress luring the listener to walk through the gates to hell.  Only one statement comes to my mind that describes this haunting cd.  It's from the inscription above the gates to hell in Dantes Divine Comedy,"Abandon all hope ye who enter here".  And if you dare to enter Darklore Manor you may never return.  
 There are many books dealing with Mao's China and Red Azalea would be a fine choice to begin. It is a truthful account of life under an oppressive political system and does much to help one understand what it was like to live and struggle and survive in such a difficult period.    
 The story of a lonely woman caught between love and propriety, self-sacrifice and self-interest, "Two on a Tower" is one of the saddest novels I've read.  I kept hoping for a description of a  blissful-but-brief interlude for Viviette, but it never materialized.   Instead, unhappiness dogged her to the novel's cruel end.  Yes, cruel.  The  final event in the book was an unnecessary stroke.  Also, while I usually  accept a character's actions, I cannot believe that Viviette NEVER  anticipated becoming pregnant.  The possibility certainly haunted ME from  the moment her secret marriage took place.        For all of it's sadness,  however, the story is engaging and provides a criticism of the unforgiving  social conventions of Hardy's time 
 Not much more I can think of to say then what the other reviewers said, except that it contains some strange and amazing information. If you are looking for a gift for a history lover, then this is not a bad choice 
 THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD. IT WAS THE BEST BOOK I EVER REA 
 I read this book through a few times and wrote a proposal loosely based on the guidelines therein (along with doing my own thing when my instincts told me that what was in the book was not going to work for me specifically). I sent it cold to 16 publishers. Two offered freelance work, and one made me an offer and is publishing the book. It's a travel guide--not fiction. In any case, I found the book helpful. It was a good resource to turn to since I didn't know anyone who had personally gone through the process. It kept me company, offered solid advice, and I recommend it 
 If you are in graduate school and decide to do your thesis as a qualitative research project, I would highly recommend this book.  Even though the authors describe what qualitative research is, I would recommend that you read one of the texts they mention for the individual techniques. For example, even though it has a nice overview of case study, one should read Yin's book on case study research 
 In spite of the "Disappointing" and "Don't Recommend To Christians" reviews, I found the personal accounts of out-of-body spirit experiences revealing. Obviously Mr. Jasso is trying to view this book (and probably any other on NDE's) through "where's Jesus?" glasses. The concept of spirits continuing on after one or more body deaths is far far older than Christianity, and is a concept that used to be embraced in the Bible, until it was expunged around the year 530 by the then-Pope and others. And who says spirits have to stick around this planet when they leave a body? It's logical that, a spirit not being subject to things like eating and breathing, they could hang out anywhere. I didn't feel that the author/collector tweeked the accounts at all, they are all from the minds and memories of the spirits (humans) who experienced it themselves. The fact that they rock people's pre-programmed ideas of "heaven", "hell", and other things religious should be an eye-opener, not a cause to retreat into the citadel of fixed ideas. That's how we end up with things like Inquisitions. I think Kevin Williams' evaluations of what the experiences "meant" in relation to Christ, God, or any angle of any religion is beside the point. The people felt and saw what they felt and saw. I am not particularly Christian and found his evaluations of the experiences along a Christian angle a bit distracting. But they work as a reference point to a "bigger spirit", which every religion has embraced. I think we will all get a big surprise when we "pop out". One thing was consistent throughout most of them though (the girl's suicide account was very revealing), and that is that if the person/spirit cannot find it in themselves to generate affinity, love, whatever you want to call it, then they will be trapped with their own miseries. By their accounts it sounds easy to do, when not burdened by Earthly bodies and cares, if they can just embrace the possibility. The other thing consistent was that there is no fire-breathing ogre waiting to punish punish punish. The spirits seem to do a great job of punishing themselves for their harmful acts committed during their lives, which is plenty. FYI the accounts in this book and more can be found online at the author's website 
 I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann 
 Vonnegut tells the reader at the beginning of this book that it is one of his only books for which he knows the moral of the story - you are what you pretend to be.  In Mother Night, Vonnegut tells the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American who lives in Germany prior to WWII and is recruited by the United States to act as a spy in Nazi Germany.  Campbell becomes one of the most valuable Allied spies of the war, but acts as a Nazi radio propagandist during the war, serving the Nazis as well, or maybe even better, than he does the Allies.  The novel covers the fallout in Campbell's life from his decisions.  It is a dark story, but it is told in a manner typical of Vonnegut, using humor and a free-form style to lighten the mood.  You get to witness many characters' judgements of Campbell, but none are decisive.  You are left to decide for yourself what you think of Campbell.  Fantastic.  Highly recommended 
 I just returned from a one-week beach vacation and Robert Hellenga's marvelous book was my companion for the week.  I finished it on the plane coming home, with the tears running down my face.  Like every great novel , it introduced me to memorable characters and it made me think hard about important issues: about terrorism, death, marriage, sex, and most especially about the relationships between parents and children.  As the father of a daughter just about to be launched into the world and an unknowable future, I found it personally relevant 
 I first heard Madeleine Peyroux playing through the speakers in a Starbucks on a trip to Seattle. Her voice was magical and I just had to ask who it was. I love Billie Holiday and her style of singing is very similar.  This cd is a wonderful collection of songs from Patsy Cline's "Walkin' after midnight" to Edith Piaf's "La vie en rose", you'll love every song.  Her other cd "Careless Love" is also a wonderful collection.  You can't go wrong with this cd, it's simply lovely.   
 Heinz Guderian's account of the development of the German armor forces between the wars and the accompanying strategy is one of the major readings in anyone's understanding of armored warfare.   Guderian helped to develop the concept of blitzkrieg, a concept similar to Liddel Hart's of the massing armored forces in conjuction with air power and artillery. Guderian was the prime architect of the invasion of France and after being relieved by Hitler was then called back to service as Inspector of Panzer Forces in 1943.  Guderian's theories are still in effect today in slightly different manifestations and are mainly used by the US Army's Armored Warfare doctrine. As a witness to modern armor tactics in Desert Storm and the 3rd Infantry Divisions drive north into Iraq in 2003- complete with German style 'reconnaissance in force' forays, I'd go so far as to say the the Army's Armored operational doctrine is a direct descendent of both Guderian and Von Manstein.   Guderian's Panzer Leader is without a doubt, a required read for anyone interested in the military history of WWII 
 It is a great book for children to learn about America, its geography, history, and much more.  I don't know why some reviewers even mention their political orientation here.  It has really nothing to with the great book.  It is a perfect educational volume for children, no matter by whom it was written. It reminds me very much of Book 3 from the series "Why Some Cats Are Rascals" it which the readers also learn a lot about American history and geography by following the Oregon Trail with all the cats back in the year 1862...  I think these two books make a perfect package for a Christmas Gift 
 This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something.  But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time.  There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) & writing & imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
 This upper-class New England satire of the post-college lives of 8 women has definitely stood the test of time. I read it maybe 30 years ago and just reread it: it still works, and at my present age, I find myself appreciating McCarthy's superb writing on an entirely new level. Each of the women comes from a different background, has widely different experiences both in Vassar and after graduation, and sees her world after college thru different eyes. Told mostly thru the point of view of one member of the group, McCarthy's classic story lacerates socialism, the Ivy League, the prevalent double standards of the era, men - and psychoanalysis. Is there anything she doesn't excoriate with her talented tongue. Um, no, I don't think she's missed a thing 
 Philip K. Dick's work has to be taken as a body. All of it encompasses what I call his "ironic paranoia." "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" fits right into this.  The problems with Dick's films are two. They are either (1) too philosophical or (2)  action films. Or they are both. What they have not been is ironical. And without irony, you haven't got Dick.  "Minority Report," "Blade Runner," and even "Screamers" were enjoyable films. But they all lacked Dick's wit. Only "Total Recall" came close, with its unexpected twists feeding on paranoia, though the overall result was more burlesque than satire.  Stick with "Androids" and the other novels and short stories, especially the earlier ones (through 1965). Taken as a body of work, they are monumental 
 I've looked at many books on quantum field theory and this is without doubt the best introductory work I have found. The Weinberg book jumps in at the deep end, the Kaku book jumps in at about 6 feet deep but this one allows you to at least climb into the pool. It's a rare intelligence to be aware of how to lead one's reader along the learning curve and these authors display it. Typo errors occur at the rate of about one every two pages (did anyone read the proofs?) but they are easily discovered if one follows the math carefully 
 When I look at the Doors and Jim Morrison I see some of the most physicadelic people on Earth. Reading this novel truly gave me an insight on Morrison's mind, from his childhood to his demise. Reading this I learned how he was thought of as a hero by the public and a drunken frat-boy by his friends and bandmates. I loved this novel and I loved learning of the life of Jim Morrison.  However, this is not an amazingly written novel. You see, The Doors made amazing music; Hopkins and Sugerman do not make the most suffisticated novels. For instance, one of Morrison's acid trips on stage will be described at the beggining of a paragraph and then a night on the town with his soul mate a month later will be described at the end.  Reading NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE is truly a stimulating experience. That is , if you can get past these written mistakes. I sugget you buy this novel 
 Perfect condition; great price. Better than I had expected. The order was shipped quickly, no hassle. I bought another one just after I had received the first! 
 What a difference, flare ups are gone perfect fit in gril 
 Rene Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy is arguably the starting point for much of modern western philosophy.  This short work comprises approximately 60 pages.  Potential buyers should note that it does not include the "Objections and Replies" portion that is available in some other editions.   Although there are many important and helpful philosophical works, Meditations is probably one of the few must read for students of philosophy.  Cress' translation does a commendable job of allowing readers to interact with this significant historic text.  In Meditations Descartes touches on many key philosophical questions, the role of scepticism, the existence of God and mind-body dualism.  This short 17th Century text is by no means an exhaustive examination of these issues - its value is largely the historical context it provides.  Its arguements have, however, held up remarkably well over time.  Overall a true classic - I highly recommend it.  This short book is a handy reference and good value.  Some readers, however, may wish to consider purchasing Meditations as part of a broader collection.  
 If you liked Brad Pitt before he began appearing on the cover of People magazine every week, this is the film for you. Set in the early 20th c., before and after WWI, it's the story of Captain Ludlow, a veteran of the Indian Wars, marvelously played by Anthony Hopkins, and his three sons. Brad Pitt is Tristan, the middle son, a loner and lover of the wild, incredibly sexy and the favorite. Beautiful Julia Ormond shows up on the arm of the youngest brother, Samuel, as his fiancée, and the seclusion that the Captain has enjoyed from the turmoil of the wars is shattered. All three brothers are smitten, but reality intrudes when the idealistic Samuel decides to go to Canada to enlist, and his devoted brothers go with him to protect him. Samuel's foolish decision sets off a train of events that leaves many victims behind, except Tristan, who in the end is "the rock against which all others break."   Brad Pitt is marvelous in this film--although a bit overwrought at times, he can convey love, sincerity, integrity and humor, as well as brutality and insanity. Aidan Quinn, who seems to do mostly TV these days, is the pained older brother, who does everything right but is never loved. This sweeping epic won the Oscar for cinematography, and the prize was well-deserved. Be prepared for a few tough WWI scenes, and some gratuitous gore along the way, but the story grabs you and doesn't let go--you'll enjoy it. 
 Used this in medical school. Excellent resource. In my time google and yahoo were not around, so this was the quick source. now that [...] is around, not as necessary, but still valuable. There is a pediatric version as well. High yield 
 I have been an avid reader for years now but never saw fit to read anything by Clive Cussler.   One day I gave in and picked up a copy of his book "Dragon".  I am glad I did and I can now tell you why Cussler has sold so many books over the years.   Quite frankly he tells a good story.  Then there is always his alter ego the swashbuckling hero Dirk Pitt, think a combination of James Bond and Indiana Jones.  The two combine to produce a tremendously fun piece of escapist fiction.  Written in 1990 "Dragon" may seem a bit dated.  It was written at the height of America's fear of being economically dominated by Japan.  It in no way detracts from the story whatsoever.  Cussler has a wonderful ability to weave together historical and contemporary elements into one grand tale.  In the case of "Dragon", how can a World War II bomber sitting at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean hold the key to saving the free world from a fabulously wealthy Japanese industrialist determined to establish Japan as the world's preeminent superpower?   That is the riddle to be solved by Dirk Pitt and company if they are to save the day.  "Dragon" is full of samurai assassins, killer robots, nuclear brinkmanship, gadgets and heroic acts of daring-do.  It is an immensely fun page-turner that I highly recommend 
 I am an Excel MVP and pretty much know Excel inside out, yet I learned so many cool things from this wonderful book! I was often confused knowing the difference between calculated fields and calculated items, but this book really cleared that up for me. I can't think of any piece of using pivot tables which was either left out or glossed over. The book will make you a pivot table master! Highly recommended, whether you're a beginner or an Excel guru 
 When I had the chance meeting of J.A. Jance years ago in a bookstore in Palm Desert, California, she had told me she was in the process of creating a new series, which came to be known as the Sheriff Joanna Brady series. She had felt she needed a break from her J.P. Beaumont detective series. Over a decade later, she has the two characters meet in her latest novel, Partner in Crime.   Partner in Crime is set in Bisbee, Arizona, the home of Sheriff Joanna Brady. A newcomer to town, Rochelle Baxter, is getting ready to have her first ever art exhibit. Unfortunately, the day before the show Rochelle is poisoned with a chemical known as sodium azide. This compound has no taste, no smell, is hard to trace, and is readily available (sounds like the perfect murder weapon to me!). And so, the hunt for the killer begins. But when the next of kin notifications are taking place, Sheriff Brady discovers that Rochelle Baxter is really Latisha Wall, a lady placed in Bisbee by the Washington State Attorney General's office's witness protection program. And the tale twists into a mystery involving two states, two law enforcement officers used to being in charge, and two very strong personalities.   Sheriff Brady has her hands full trying to find the killer, when J.P. Beaumont arrives in town to "observe the investigation". Seems Beau is now with the Washington State's S.H.I.T. (Special Homicide Investigative Team) and since their witness is now dead, they feel a need to see who really killed her.   Sheriff Brady is not too happy having a "watch dog" at her heels while she and her detectives are trying to solve this crime. Not only does she have to deal with Beau, but she also has to handle the never ending problems that go with being a sheriff: budget cuts, Marliss Shackleford (the annoying newspaper columnist who has a grudge against her), balancing work and home, among other things.   I have to admit the joining of these two characters was a bit confusing. Only a handful of supporting characters originated in Seattle with the majority of them hailing from Bisbee. It was almost like urbanite Beaumont was tossed into the middle of the wild, wild west complete with a chase on horseback! A bit on the strange side for Jance, but nevertheless, it was still enjoyable.   We're again given glimpses into the lives of Jenny (Joanna's daughter), Butch (Joanna's husband), Frank Montoya, Jaime Carbajal, and a few others typically in the Brady series-supporting cast. We're given a very brief glimpse into Beau's life, with a few pages on new love interest, Naomi Pepper and on his working relationship with his supervisor, Harry I. Ball (now that was funny!). But to me, it was completely unnecessary unless Jance is planning something in the future and is laying the groundwork for the next book. The focus could have centered on Bisbee and the characters there with only mentions of the Seattle crew.   The story line was great and the character development was her usual standard of excellence. The hardest part while reading was the switching back and forth of writing style. Jance wrote the Beaumont series in a first person writing style, while the Brady series is in the third person style. So which did she choose for Partner in Crime? She combined them, thus switching back and forth depending on which character she was currently focusing. This sometimes resulted in a shaking of the head to keep from jumping the track.   The part of the book that made me really think was the Author's Note in the back of the book. Jance tells her reading audience that she first heard about sodium azide while reading her alumni magazine from the University of Arizona. It seems this deadly chemical is readily available and the public is unaware of the potential hazards. Sodium azide is used to inflate air bags found in vehicles from about 1995 on. Once it ignites an air bag, the substance becomes "a harmless nitrogen based gas." However, how many vehicles are in junkyards with air bags still intact and these canisters with a deadly compound sitting right there? And no one regulates this chemical and anyone can obtain it easily. Now that's a scary thought! Maybe a letter to your legislative representatives is in order, before murders are committed using this lethal compound. At least that's the suggestion of Jance.   Thanks for reading; I'm off to write my congressman... 
 This was written on a dare that a woman could not create such a book. She did in the late 1940s and it has endured but is now a little worn. Still worth reading--you want to be able to drop "Sir Stephen" and "Nathalie" into conversation and see if the other person KNOWS--but it has been surpassed by later works.

 This book came to my attention in the late 80's.  I was taking a course in college on death and grieving.  This book was one of the books we were required to read.  Since that time I have purchased or referred that book too many times to remember.  Over the years many people have thanked me for it.  I feel it is most important after some time has passed as it can be to "ready" and you do want some distance in order to process the information.  This book provides comfort.  It points out that not only are you not alone, but that each stage takes each person different amounts of time to process through.  The only reason I am not giving it a four is that I had one client tell me that it was not "religious" enough for him 
 Though based on a true incident that took place in 1914, in the midst of a WWI battle among the Scots, the French and the Germans, Christian Carrion's film "Joyeux Noel" nonetheless has a dreamlike, other-worldly quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about Carrion's telling of this sad, sentimental tale.  Can you imagine a contemporary world in which countries at war with each other would stop the warring long enough to drink champagne, slug vodka, play cards and toast Christ's birth? Unfortunately the Bureaucrats and Politicians react to this spur-of-the-moment camaraderie among the different factions as they usually do: they condemn the participants and accuse them of treason. All of the actors do a fine job of creating characters who genuinely feel like they are fighting for ideals and ideas that will have a lasting effect on their lives and that of their children. They are committed. They are also of course, innocent. The ethereal Diane Kruger plays a classical singer, a Swede and therefore neutral but married to a German soldier who, through some personal machinations as well as a pass from Kaiser Wilhelm finds herself on the battlefield on that special night of 12/24/1914. She sings Gounod's "Ave Maria" to a rapt audience of soldiers attending Christmas Eve Mass. It is the moral and emotional center of the film as well as its highpoint. "Joyeux Noel" is a nice reminder of a gentler time: a time when it was the moral and social imperative to always love your country, to always trust your leaders and to always cleave to your family. Unfortunately that time is long gone. 
 This dark satire of the Religious Right in rural America demonstrates how dogmatism can erase the thin line that separates sanity from insanity.  Recovering from an emotional breakdown brought on by the bathtub drowning of her child, Cynthia (Sarah Torgov) goes on a camping trip with her husband and two other couples.  Mechanical problems strand the campers on island near Seattle, where the troupe eventually runs up against Ma & Pa (Yvonne De Carlo & Rod Steiger), the demented backwoodsy parents of three murderous but mentally infantile adults.  There are some Gein-like goodies, including implied necrophelia, as the homicidal hillbillies pick off the campers one by one, but the film really focuses more on Cynthia's descent into madness in the face of it all.  Lots of subtle humor, not the least of which is the double-entendres in the names of Ma & Pa's progeny, make AMERICAN GOTHIC a fun way to waste a few hours. And over-the-top performances strengthen the entertainment value, especially those of Steiger, De Carlo, and Michael J. Pollard (who portrays Teddy, one of the psycho sons). Targov is also wonderfully whacko when her character, Cynthia, finally loses all ties with reality.  The DVD from Trinity Home Entertainment offers the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  The transfer looks a bit grainy at times but is definitely watchable.  Alas, the disc contains no bonus features, yet it's still worth the very reasonable price of admission 
 If - and that is a big if (the book is fully 600 pages long - it helps to fall ill when you read it - I did!) - you have the time and want to invest it for obtaining a first class overview over the great power play during the decade between 1955 and 1965 - the Khruschev era - this definitely is the book to read! Its authors not only provide a refreshingly new perspective to the (more or less well-) known events of, i.a., the first Israeli-Egyptian war, the (Soviet) occupation of Hungary and the Cuban missile crisis, they fully succeed in transforming this period of history into a most plausible and very exciting "story", in fact, into something of a "thriller" (in the best sense of the word). It is the story of a great power desperate to come up to its claim to possess or at least to be accorded equal status with the other - even greater - super-power, the United States or, more generally, the "West". In order to achieve that one goal, almost anything would do, even extreme brinkmanship that several times brought the world close to thermonuclear war. Khrushev is shown as a man to have carried within himself the dominating characteristics of the Soviet Union itself, viz., an enormous inferiority complex, trying to combine it with catching any opportunity that would present itself to bring pressure to bear on the other side, even using or better: threatening the use of force, wherever it seemed this might bring political advantage. Fortunately for the world, this mercurial leader who disposed of the means to blow up the world (or at least: great parts of it) was restrained enough (be it on his own reason, be it by his more risk-averse colleagues within the Presidium) not to actually let the world go "over the brink" but to withdraw each time at the last moment. It is the humiliation of these retreats as well as the sense of responsibility displayed by him in making them which, if anything, ultimately cost him his job and earns him the status of a statesman (rather than merely that of a cunning politician).  Against this background, only two - very minor - criticisms:  First, there is a really unwarranted "blank space" in the book as regards the European Economic Community (today`s "European Union") whose very creation was decisively triggered by some of the events described in it (Suez; Hungary), by making the European states mercilessly feel their own palsy vis-à-vis the super-powers. It is ironic - and should clearly have been mentioned in the book - to see how the very institution for whose creation Khruschev bore no minor responsibility - would become one of the cornerstones of the West's economic superiority and thus a decisive factor for the eventual downfall of the Soviet Empire.  Second, even though this would admittedly go slightly beyond the clear scope of the book (Khruschev's Cold War, restricting its topic to his role as politician), it might have been interesting for the reader to be permitted at least a brief peep behind the veil of this astounding politician's official role into his private life, if only to underpin/corroborate some of the conclusions regarding this most Mercurial character!  This leaves only one thing to be hoped for: at least I, for my part, am dying to read PART II: "The Breshnev Years", by the same authors, should it ever come out!   
 Chomsky once again holds the mirror up to America and shows how blatantly hypocritical and disingenuous our foreign policy actually is. In this book his primary focus is on the Reagan administration and Central America, where corporate and military interests were promoted at the expense of the indiginous people and "true" democracy. Recent events (the 2000 Bush "coup", Webb's book on cocaine and the contras, the Columbia "aid" package, etc.) show how truly relevant this research is. Also, do not let the simpletons of the right and the mainstream (is there really a difference between the two anymore?) critique Chomsky without comment or evidence. His research, unlike theirs (on those rare occasions when they actually engage in true journalism) is meticulously documented and uses their own words and documents as source material. One last thing, if you don't get this book then get any book from Chomsky on American economic and foreign policy (I recommend his work on Israel and the Palestinians as a particularly contemporary selection) 
 THE FOLDING STAR tells the story of Edward Manners, a sentimentally detached man who leaves England to earn his living as a private language tutor in a Flemish city. The exquisite prose of this 1994 release delineates a man's aching melancholy and longing for love despite his odd sexual economy during the few years prior to his arrival in Belgium. Therefore, unlike the most recent, highly-acclaimed THE LINE OF BEAUTY, the novel affords a plot no more than Edward Manners's hypnotic fantasy of one of his young pupils. The 33-year-old seems to be at the emotional crossroad: he often smiles at his own sense of anticipation, of being poised for change, and is ready to fall in love. But he is not used to spending so much time with one person that he thinks of a committed relationship dreads him.  It might be love at first sight that no sooner has he met Luc than he takes an intimate fancy of him. The adoration quickly becomes a morbid infatuation that manifests into a pepperoni type of spying on the boy during his weekend excursion. He has no doubt driven Edward mad at times - he feels empty and is aching for him. The boy has affected everything Edward does to the point that he suffers without feeling afflicted. The stream of consciousness reflects Manners's despair over the unfulfilled love and the thumping of the heart. He can only console himself with other affairs to which no sentiment constitutes, other than the minimal trust of two people pleasuring themselves together, without much grasp of friendship or understanding.  THE FOLDING STAR is about the unrequited love that leaves a man constantly longing, without the prospect of ever finding love. The mixed feelings of anxious longing and fear of commitment constitute a poignant air that hovers over the novel. It delivers the message that the course of true love never runs straight. The reading reminds one of the similar sentimental nuances Henry James experiences in Colm Toibin's THE MASTER. While Henry James consciously makes it a habit to keep his affection at bay and secretly longs for the intimate companion of a man, Edward Manners always finds himself marveling at how his sudden burst of feeling has wrongfooted him. Both engage in a somnambulist journey to find love. The former lives in such vessel of loneliness and independence - in a social sphere that is pinned and stifled with rules. The latter leaves his home to escape the same constraints only to find himself trapped by his emotions. That his sex life has well petered out before he comes to Belgium is the impediment to his surrender to commitment.  THE FOLDING STAR is a stoic tale about the quest for love. Edward Manners lives among many gay men not only in the regard of the longing for a relationship but also in the sense of the nervousness, excitement, sensuality, and anxiety. One may think of the novel being made up of snapshots all these contradicting emotions that roam back and forth the character. It exquisitely depicts the nuances of affection, the anticipation for intimacy, and the desire of fulfillment of unconditional needs. Hollinghurst renders with artistry and haunting precision love's merging of language and lust. 
 The photography is outstanding!  Beautifully done expressing the dignity and grace of the female in all ages of life.  Inspirational 
 This model replaced my Monster 2GHz splitter, which cost twice the price, and my cable company's cheapo 3-way. As soon as I connected the AR, I noted the same sharpness I saw with the Monster, but color was cleaner and there seems to be less digital noise coming from my cable box; shadow areas and dimly sighted scenes in cable broadcasts look as if the lower light levels are more dimensional and clear. Would you believe there are so-called "studio-grade" splitters that sell for up to $150 ?!? AR is a fraction of that, and half the price of its competition -- but if it works, it works. Recommended.  
 Rosacea had been making my life miserable for the past five years.  My depression over the disease was literally ruining my life.  A fellow rosacean suggested this book to me after she found it so helpful.  I have been following the suggestions in the book for a little over a month now.  There is no doubt that my skin has begun to dramatically improve.  I hope the author reads these reviews, because I want her to know how thankful I am to her.  If you have rosacea, get this book.  I can't recommend it highly enough 
 In the year 1958, the Springhill Mine Disaster occurred in Nova Scotia, where men were trapped and plunged into darkness below sea level with little hope of escape or ever seeing their families again.  As you reach further into the book you become distraught and filled with anxiety one time and then hope at another interval.. For from day to day the picture changed and one was never sure how the trapped miners were going to have the strength to persevere.   They were challenged beyond what I thought humankind could endure, and then again it is at those weakest moments when we do find that strength, and do the impossible.......like jumping fences too high for us........cutting off our legs if they hurt too badly, those kind of things.   This book is true story and not to be taken for lightly or for granted. I would give this book five golden stars......and then Ms. Melissa Fay Greene for her wonderful courage in writing this great book.  Heather (SUGAR-CANE 
 While browsing aimlessly at a local bookstore, this title caught my eye. Just coming off of an enjoyable "Wandering Hill" read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very "readable" and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy 
 Great show that is no longer on the air. The complete series is well worth the money...not that it was a lot or anything. 
 Practical and easy to use. Good thoughts that seem easy to put into action. Good way to teach today's children 
 I am the student of one of the author. The writing style of this book just like the teaching style of my advisor, very clear and precise. The home work at the end of each chapter helps students understand the fundmentals of polymer engineering better. I am very lucky to be taught by one of the authors. 
 This book is well organized and explain's Kay's Inductive Method very clearly. It is easy to read but does require practice to become second nature. Her methods make Bible passages come alive with the background and context as well as the message and underlying application in our daily lives 
 (3.5/5 stars) With a Brian DePalma film, one can usually expect a good deal more than simply an involving story. He is a talented craftsman, who delights in making his films into an experience. In "Femme Fatale," which DePalma both wrote and directed, he draws us in from the onset by refusing to show the face of our heroine. Then, a prolonged scene to set up the story, in which Ravel's "Bolero" is used to good effect. Set against the backdrop of a film premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, this scene is a wonder to behold. The plot of the film is rather implausible and requires some suspension of disbelief in order to appreciate it. If one does invest the time and effort, however, the film provides enough action and plot to hold one's interest. Ultimately, DePalma gives his audience credit for recognizing the difference between fact and fiction, so he has fun with the plot twists and turns. I won't go into the story here because I don't want to give away anything. Fans of Antonio Banderas might be disappointed because he doesn't show up for the first forty-five minutes or so. This is really Rebecca Romijn's movie, and she does a very decent job. It is worth watching at least once and might be worth owning if you are a DePalma or Romijn fan. 
 Human emotion is brought to the fore in this intelligent drama involving three best friends and the women in their lives.  Michael (De Niro), Nick (Walken) & Steven (Savage) are three hunting buddies living in Clairton, Penn.  When the three of them get enlisted in the air-force and ushered off to Vietnam their lives are changed forever.  After they are captured and tortured at the hands of the enemy they are forced to reevaluate their lives, look at who they are and what they've become.  After escaping all three make different decisions, Nick staying in Vietnam, Steven being sent home injured and Michael returning home to comfort Nick's girlfriend Linda (Streep) who begins to take a liking to Michael.  The real heart or soul of this film is the effect each action has on the one's involved, watching the war and their capture rip each of these men, and Linda as well, apart at the seems.  The brilliance is in the acting, each emotion captured perfectly never once appearing as forced or faux, every feeling melting off of these men and women without any effort...especially in regards to De Niro and Streep who, in my opinion, should have walked away with Oscars.  As we watch relationships build and break between friends and lovers we are drawn into these people's lives and giving a reason to watch, a reason to listen and a reason to care.  Brilliantly crafted and wonderfully executed, `The Deer Hunter' is worth every bit of the praise and acclaim it has received and is yet to receive 
 I'm not sure why Sony, which now owns I Dream of Jeannie, decided to colorize the first season of this series.  Whatever the reason, you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more.  The reason for that is simple--I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white.  And for a television fan like myself, that's the ONLY way to watch the first season.  The episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them.  Since I wasn't around in 1965, I'm pretty sure I've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here.  But to me, they're still pretty good.  The theme music, in my opinion, is every bit as good as the second theme, introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966.    The one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode.  That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s, and it is consistenly rated, along with Viacom's old blue V of Doom, as the scariest logo in the history of television.  The new Sony outro doesn't pack the same punch.  Still, if you liked Jeannie way back when, you'll love it now, especially since you can watch it anytime you like, without commercial interruption 
 Sunk into the deepest hole of society and rejection, the main character Holden tells his story of a teenage who is tired of the `phony' people around him. Holden Caulfield is a character of rebellion yet full of vulnerabilities that he can not over come. Once again getting kicked out of school, Holden wonders the streets of New York to evade facing his disappointed parents. As Holden journeys in the city of New York, he faces a decision of whether to accept adulthood or forever live childhood. In New York, Holden experiences sex, liquor, and other decisions teenagers face today. J.D. Salinger gave Holden the intelligence to see human flaws yet stripped from him the ability to see the positive side of human nature. As Holden introduces to the "madman stuff" that happened to him in chapter 1, the readers are directed into a path of his troubled and sensitive mind as he travels in New York. Though Holden pretends to be perfectly independent and self-sufficient, he is not. Holden's imaginary control over his emotions and acts of self-alienation pushed him even closer to self-rejection. The Catcher in the Rye is a book that will teach its readers to enjoy the simplicity of life and not see everything to the extreme. Because one will not only feel sundry emotions such as joy, sadness, astonishment, and intimidation but also be taken on a journey that exposes the ugliness of human nature yet the beautiful side of family and love.  
  I've dealt with all other kinds of pocket notebooks, all of which fold, deform, get pages easily folded over and ripped out and stained. The Moleskine is an elegant little solution that protects itself with a thin, unobtrusive cover and a small elastic strap which has avoided every other problem that's plagued previous notebooks. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive 
 My two toddlers love Scholastics "Where The Wild Things Are" DVD, which features some of the songs on this Carole King CD. It was the DVD that inspired me to purchase this CD, because the songs are infectious and well done. I'm not a fan of Carole King, and this is not a trip down memory lane for me, just some of the best music for kids that I have run across. If you are unfamiliar with these tunes, the original stage production, and/or the Maurice Sendak books from which the lyrics are lifted, don't let that keep you from purchasing some of the most creative and imaginative music available for kids. I am very glad I did. We crank it up in the car have a blast 
 Apart from all the slick tricks this book pulls on the very ill-attired, stumblebum Popcorn John that is the Wes-tarn genre, it's just plain lovely USA chin-music throughout. If you take the trouble to read this aloud to friends and loved ones, you will have living proof (once again, should you need it) that at *least* half of all authentic American culture was imported from Africa 
 black milk is the future j dilla , all the beats in this lp are dope for real , and the rapping also is great .i listen to this cd everywhere i go . damn.. popular demand is my fav album of 2007 after sean p and wisemen .just buy it u not gonna regret it is a pure music a must hav. 
 Never has any book touched me so deeply, sans the Book of Mormon.  This book very gently takes the reader to a realm of love, forgiveness and enlightenment.  After reading this book twice, I have felt compelled to buy it for friends and family 
 These ladies were given a very hard time, not because of a lack of talent, but because some people didn't want them to exercise their right to free speech.  They came through it with class.  This is a great album, moving just a little away from their country roots.  The single and title track "Not Ready to Make Nice" is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time 
 Author Dan Denning's outlook for the U.S. economy is gloomy. We are in a long term bear market for financial assets that began in 2000. The "killer 'D's", rising household debt, mounting fiscal deficits, and a weakening U.S. dollar, once the gold standard of international reserves, point to anemic returns for investors accustomed to profiting from broad-based U.S. mutual funds. We have heard all this before, but it provides the set-up for Denning's main ideas. His point is that money is being made in bull markets at this time. Investors can find a bull market if they look where the money is flowing. It is going overseas, so go global with your investments and use ETFs (exchange traded funds that track a basket of representative stocks) to hedge the risk of choosing the wrong company in illiquid and often murky markets. To his credit Denning does identify individual companies in the mining, agribusiness, and energy markets. He finds these companies in the U.K., South Korea, Australia, Brazil, and yes, the U.S. Each of the companies he identifies may profit from the global need for food, energy, and construction. The businesses of these companies illustrate the macro trends moving the fastest growing economies.  That brings us to China and India. Separate chapters for each country sketch the opportunities and pitfalls of investing directly in these giant emerging economies. These are anecodotal observations, but they are insightful. Denning's depiction of China's economic strategy is especially sobering. China is using its multi-billions of U.S. trade surplus dollars to acquire the production facilities and infrastructure worldwide to deliver natural resources to its economy. It is using our currency to buy hard assets and develop capital intensive industries that have historically made countries dominant. These are industries that employ large numbers of people to make 'things' and create material wealth for an emerging middle class. As I was writing this I saw a newspaper headline, "Chinese Firms to Pay $1.42 Billion for [a Canadian company's] Oil Assets in Ecuador". India had also shown interest in the assets. The story cited other recent examples of Chinese state run companies bidding on oil and gas properties around the world. As Denning quips, China is not "racing out to buy Google".  Investors who have accepted the need to diversify their holdings into other markets will appreciate the insights and enthusiasm of the author for a strategy that has been working well and holds promise for the future 
 I have two kids in college and a third just graduated. Cafeteria eating has been a struggle for all of them.  When I gave them the Smart Student's Guide to read, they commented how it presents simple ways for any college student to achieve a healthy life-style--activities and nutrition that can be easily integrated into the crazy routine of a college student.   I'll be giving The Smart Student's Guide to Healthy Dorm Living as a gift to the many kids I know graduating from high school.  Why have them get caught in the pitfalls?  They need to read how to identify and avoid them ahead of time.    The healthy advice presented in this book easily crosses over to other "walks" of life.  I work at a desk most of the day.  The freshmen fifteen translates as winter weight. The dorm room exercises work right in my office.  The college cafeteria translates as an all-you-can eat restaurant.  This book gives insights on what to look for.  If you implement even some of the suggestions, it will have a positive effect on your health.    
 Most comprehensive book I have found that covers all the different points about teaching sewing.  Covers costs, traveling, children and where to get lesson plans.  A great start to finding out about a new teaching career 
   Lawrence Lessig could not say enough good things about this book when he spoke at Wikimania 2006 in Boston last week, so I ordered it while listening to him.  It arrived today and I dropped everything to go through it.  This book could well be the manifesto for 21st Century of Informed Prosperous Democracy.  It is a meticulous erudite discussion of why information should not be treated as property, and why the "last mile" should be built by the neighborhood as a commons, "I'll carry your bits if you carry mine."  The bottom line of this book, and I will cite some other books briefly, is that democracy and prosperity are both enhanced by shared rather than restricted information.  The open commons model is the only one that allows us to harness the distributed intelligence of the Whole Earth, where each individual can made incremental improvements that cascade without restraint to the benefit of all others.  As I write this, both the publishing and software industries are in the midst of a "last ditch" defense of copyright and proprietary software.  I believe they are destined to fail, and IBM stands out as an innovative company that sees the writing on the wall--see especially IBM's leadership in developing "Services Science."  The author has written the authoritative analytic account of the new social and political and financial realities of a networked world with information embedded goods.  There have been earlier accounts--for example, the cover story of Business Week on "The Power of Us" with its many accounts of how Lego, for example, received 1,600 free engineering development hours from its engaged customers of all ages.  Thomas Stewart's "The Wealth of Knowledge," Barry Carter's "Infinite Wealth," Alvin and Heidi Toffler's most recent "Revolutionary Wealth," all come to the same conclusion: you cannot manage 21st Century information-rich networks with 20th Century industrial control models.  Lawrence Lessig says it best when he speaks of the old world as "Read Only" and the new world as "Read-Write" or interactive.  His fulsome praise for this author and this book suggest that the era of sharing and voluntary work has come of age.  On that note, I wish to observe that those who label the volunteers who craft Wikis including the Wikipedia as "suckers" are completely off-base.  The volunteers are the smartest of the smart, the vanguard for a new economy in which bartering and sharing displace centralized financial and industrial control.  Indeed, with the localization of energy, water, and agriculture, this book by this author could not be more important or timelier.  One final supportive anecdote, this one from the brilliant Michael Eisen, champion of open publishing.  He captured the new paradigm perfectly at Wikimania when he likened the current publishing environment as one in which scientists give birth to babies, the publishers play a mid-wifery role, and then claim that as midwives, they have a perpetual right to the babies and will only lease them back to the parents.  What a gloriously illuminating analogy this is.  I will end by tying this book and this author to C.K. Prahalad's "The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid."  That other book focuses on the fact that the five billion poor are actually worth four trillion in disposable income, versus the one billion rich worth one trillion.  C.K. Prahalad posits a world in which capitalism stops focusing on making disposable high-end high cost goods, and turns instead to making sustainable low-cost goods.  I see the day coming when--the avowed goal of the Wiki Foundation--there is universal free access to all information in all languages all the time.  If Marx and his Communist Manifesto were the tipping point for communism, this book is the tipping point for communal moral capitalism.  Yochai Benkler is--along with Stewart Brand, Howard Rheingold, Bruce Sterling, Kevin Kelly, Lawrence Lessig, Jimbo Wales, Ward Cunningham, Brewster Kahle, and Cass Sunstein, one of the bright shining lights in our constellation of change makers.  He ends his book on an optimistic note.  Despite the craven collaboration of the U.S. Congress in extending copyright forever into the distant future, he posits a reversal of all these bad laws (it used to be legal to discriminate against women and people of color) by the combination of cultural, social, economic, and technical forces that have their own imperative.  Would that it were so, sooner 
 If you like "I Like Me" by Nancy Carlson, then you will love "A B C I Like Me"!  It is a great way to build a child's self-esteem, while teaching them the alpahabet.  The illustrations will keep young children interested until the end.  I recommend if for children  ages 3-6 
 Information gathering is a serious tool used extensively in the corporate world.  Penenberg and Barry reveal techniques commonly used to ferret out information regarding corporate adversaries, be they other corporations or individuals 
 I have read hundreds and hundreds of books in my time, but the Legends Trilogy continues to be the most moving, well-written trilogy of them all. Put shortly, the characters are developed to perfection. In no other books have I recieved the feeling so strongly that the characters I was reading about were absolutely real. If you've read Dragonlance and not read this, you're missing out. I've not read the Annotations, but the story itself is beyond compare. You will not regret the purchase, you can be certain 
 In a relatively short period of time, I've managed to very nearly become a Mark O'Connor "compleatist," grabbing up virtually everything he's released on disc. This new release - "The American Seasons" - goes to the top of my O'Connor short list, along with "Heroes" (O'Connor fiddling duet-style with virtually all of the other greats of the instrument), "Fanfare for the Volunteer" (O'Connor's alternately thrilling, moving and heartfelt violin concerto of a few years back), "Midnight on the Water" (O'Connor as triple-threat Paganini, on violin, guitar and mandolin), and "Telluride Sessions" (in which O'Connor teamed up with Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas to form the Strength in Numbers group on the most essential "Newgrass" release ever produced).  This time around, it's "all strings, all the time," with the excellent Boston-based Metamorphosen Chamber Orchestra providing the orchestra backdrop.  The title piece is a four-movement Concerto for Fiddle and Strings, representing the seasons of an American musical life (part O'Connor and part archetypal as he writes in the notes), with at least a sideways glance at Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" for the same instrumentation. But there's absolutely no risk of confusing O'Connor and Vivaldi in this work. Three of the four movements are each in two major sections, for a total of seven major themes meant to suggest the stages of life, along the lines of Shakespeare's "seven ages of man" from "As You Like It."  So much for the background. What is the work like? It's of course typical O'Connor in the sense of extending the reaches of the instrument, but yet new and different from his earlier Fiddle Concerto and "Fanfare for the Volunteer." Where those two works have their glances back at earlier musical eras (the romantic violin concerto era in the case of the Fiddle Concerto and the early 20th century of Copland, Hanson and Harris in the case of "Fanfare for the Volunteer"), this work is thoroughly grounded in more current musical idioms. Like all of O'Connor's major compositions, it is a high-wire balancing act of touchingly sweet lyricism and absolutely mind-bending pyrotechnics. The extended 4th movement cadenza is - as are so many of his solos - something that I think only he will be able to perform in the foreseeable future; it is that challenging. Listen carefully to this cadenza, particularly its closing measures, in which he achieves some spiccato ("bouncing bow") effects using both fundamentals and harmonics. This is one of those "Do not attempt this at home" challenges which I can't imagine any concert violinist attempting anytime soon; it's downright scary in its difficulty.  The second major work of the album - "Strings & Threads" - is O'Connor's "take" on the history of American vernacular fiddling in a 13-movement suite of brief reflections on styles, covering Scots-Irish fiddling from the pre-Revolutionary days through blues, ragtime, Texas-style "flat" fiddling, swing, into the present era. It should come as no surprise to anyone who has listened to his "Heroes" album that he has every one of these styles nailed.  The concluding work is an arrangement for string orchestra of his deservedly famous "Appalachia Waltz" (of the Yo-Yo Ma/Edgar Meyer/Mark O'Connor album of the same name). It was this album which first brought O'Connor to my own attention. Here, he and Edgar Meyer have arranged this famous work for string orchestra, and the Metamorphosen perform it with the achingly lyrical beauty that it deserves.  The recording - made in the warm and intimate acoustic of Mechanics Hall in Worcester, MA (which served as the architectural model for Symphony Hall in Boston) - is a model of clarity and presence. Sony has captured the sound of O'Connor and the Metamorphosen perfectly.  Too bad about that 5-star limitation, though. I really wish I could have given Mark at least a few more.  Bob Zeidle 
 It is not really a book, but an art object: accordion folded and neatly ensconced in a box, its heavy cardboard structure makes it a durable thing, one that transcends the notion of a mere "book." It is an object of intrinsic beauty and the mere holding of it in one's hands conveys the good taste, fine quality, and the superb craftmanship that were blended to create PORTRAITS.  One side of the fold contains text -with some pictures- and the other the portfolio of portraits. Maria Hambourg and Mia Fineman collaborate in the essay "Avedon's Endgame," which presents, analyzes and brings into focus the extraordinary talent behind the portraits; and Richard Avedon gives us a touching essay called "Borrowed Dogs," in which he addresses some of his unquiet talents. The other side is one's private gallery of 27 pictures (including the covers) to be savored at home, each image a meticulous print. In all it is an extraordinary performance by those involved, and a jewel to possess.  Avedon has pushed the borders of his art far beyond picture taking: a master psychologist, his portraits are potent statements about the soul and the fears and the anger and the dilapidation and the triumph and the humanity of his subjects. His pictures are so intense and revealing that the viewer cannot remain neutral. The diptych of Clarence Lippard, a drifter, makes one see more than we have any right to ask for: because if we must view the horror of a wasted life on one panel we must also accept the defiant triumphalism and humor that the second panel conveys. Waste no pity on Mr. Lippard, he asks no such thing from you.  I shall often return to this jewel for solace; and for a jolt about the meaning of being alive and a human being 
 Being an admirer of C.S. Lewis, I have often wondered what it is about his writing that I find so appealing. Many times I have had the experience of reading an especially good passage from another author and thinking to myself "that sounds like something Lewis would have written." Notice that I used the word "sound". Lewis doesn't simply convey information; he, like any good writer, writes with liquid words. And this book ("An Experiment in Criticism") is no different. The main point of the book, as many other reviewers have stated, is that readers should "receive" books instead of "using" them. In other words, don't fight the book you are reading, even if it is something that you disagree with. Lewis says that "we can find a book bad only by reading it as if it might, after all, be very good," and that "...no work can succeed without a preliminary act of good will on the part of the reader." Lewis defines a good book as one that "elicits good reading." Now, to find out what he means by "good" reading you have to read the book. When it comes to criticism, Lewis says that "You cannot be armed to the teeth and surrendered at the same moment." How many times have you read an Amazon review in which the reviewer clearly never put down his weapons? It's a wonder that they could even hold the book up to read with all the weaponry in their hands.  In a chapter about realism, Lewis presents, very charmingly, a brilliant and simple argument for the adult reading of children's literature and fantasy. I myself like to read classic children's literature from time to time--admittedly wondering, all the while, if it is a fault to do so--and Lewis clearly shows how erroneous and silly that worry is. He is famous for his asides. The man truly possesses a philosophical mind. I imagine Lewis as a little boy trying to convince his dad that it would be okay if he stayed up late to read. "Dad, let me tell you why it wouldn't hurt anything; I have some pretty good reasons." "Jack," says Lewis's dad, "just go to bed; tomorrow is another day." "Yeah but just listen." "Fine, go ahead." Lewis then proceeds to lay down such a tight logical argument that his dad can do nothing but turn and leave the room as little Jack runs to the bookshelf. Ha! Ha!  There is a very interesting chapter on poetry. Lewis wonders if poetry will suffer the same fate as rhetoric: once being important and vital, but eventually being confined strictly to academia. Lewis wrote this in 1961, and my own opinion is that poetry is now there. For example, I took a literature class a few semesters ago that completely--and intentionally--ignored poetry. But Lewis has plenty more to say about poetry. I thought this was a great quote about modern poetry: "It is a pity if a glazed picture is so placed that you see in it only your own reflection; it is not a pity when a mirror is so placed." In other words, in reading "old poetry," one should be able to grasp the authors intention; but when reading modern poetry, it is sometimes only possible to ultimately see yourself. And "that's not a pity," says Lewis. With that being said, I think Lewis prefers the old--as do I.   Lewis is utterly fair in this book. There were a few times when I thought that he was going to slam a certain style or book or way of reading, but he never does. To put it simply, the man is very kind. He is also very interesting to read. If there is anyone with the credentials to discuss books and reading, it is C.S. Lewis. I have heard many a Lewis scholar talk of their amazement at the amount of books he read. Peter Kreeft once offhandedly commented that "it seems as if Lewis has read every book ever written." But before we read as many books as Lewis, we have to read this book first. As Lewis says in another essay, "You can't get second things by putting them first; you can get second things only by putting first things first." Read this book and gain the tools to tackle, and fully digest and receive, all other books. If you're a big time reader--or if you don't presently enjoy reading but want to acquire the taste--this is a book you need to read. I have found that I can go back to this book again and again, and I continue to find things that I never knew were there.   (If your main interest is with non-fiction, I would suggest Mortimer Adler's classic book entitled "How to Read a Book." 
 This book was very, very, let me repeat VERY useful and helpful for me. I bought it when I was just a Marine girlfriend and now I'm a proud Marine wife and still use it to look up those silly acronyms that they boys think they need to use all the time. :) It has a little bit of everything for everyone and would definitley reccomend it to any Girlfriend, Fiancee, and Wife in the Armed Services.  God Bless our Troops!! 
 I enjoyed this season very much. I found it more cohesive than the first season. I liked that one to, but part of the way in I wasn't sure where it was going. It sort of lagged, seemingly unsure just what it had gotten itself into. In this one, though, there's a clear movement forward from the start - even if the plot is quite convoluted. It feels like the writers and the actors have really settled into the skin of the characters and the setting. They speak and act wonderfully, each of them representing different areas of society, speaking differently depending on who they're speaking too, etc. Very well done. I'm looking forward to what comes next and ever so thankful that HBO has the guts to do programs like this. Who would've thought a cable channel would end up making some of the best stuff out there - even better and grittier than much of what's on the big screen these days 
 A must see!  Powerhouse performances from Ms. Davis and Ms. Crawford in this unforgettable classic film.  From the opening number "I've written a letter to daddy" to the rat on the serving tray, this film is unforgettable.  Baby Jane Hudson dishes out classic lines as an aging alcoholic slipping into madness and tormenting her sister Blanche.  "See you next Tuesday" etc!  Hysterical.  This film has influenced everyone from John Waters to Alice Cooper.  The second disc is loaded with extras, but you'll probably only watch it once.  The 1st disc is the full black and white classic film perfectly transferred from film.  The production is intense.  Own it today.  Well worth the cost (which wasn't high at all) 
 I'm surprised, pleased, amazed, put your adjective there... it's one of the best technical books I ever read, and by far the most entertaining! I congratulate the authors for making learning so easy! I am taking an 'official' presential j2ee course and I have to tell you, I have learned more in two nights reading this book than in 2 months of course. I have taken a lot of courses on study and teaching techniques (I'm a teacher myself) and I think this is the way you have to present a technical content. You end with a solid understanding of the subject, you remember the subject... and you smile at it! can you ask for more 
 We all know Nicole Richie as a reality tv show vixen, a fashion queen, and as Lionel Richie's adopted daughter. What can be added to that list is a author with much potential for more great books in the future. This was a quick read, but the plot was easy to understand, and I love how Nicole input alot of her humor into the book so the audience wouldn't get bored. The Truth About Diamonds is loosely based on the upbringing of Nicole Richie(although she doesn't exactly say it is, but people with background information on Nicole know). In the book, Chole, the main character was adopted by a rock star. Chole rarely got attention from her famous father. Nicole has a posse of friends-who've-done-nothing-to-get-rich, and they all stay close throughout the book, regardless of one another's problems. Chole is a drug-addict, who says that Simon (who I assume in real life is suppose to be Paris Hilton) is the one she learned all her bad behavior from. Chole and Simmon get caught up in a commercial ad for makeup that really boosts there reputations and celebrity status. In a whirlwind of fame, fortune, and money, it is sometimes easy to forget the "truth" about "diamonds." 
 Simply written, but every word counts. A business book written by someone who has lived by what is preached. Very inspiring... yet "in your face" reality check of what most leaders lack to truly reach thier potential. If you are brave enough to follow the principles laid out in this book, you had better be prepared to deal with success 
 As a newbie to sailing, I found this book a to be a wonderful overview of sailboats and sailing in general.  The book is organized into short chapters covering just about everything I wanted to know before deciding to purchase a sailboat.  The diagrams are just right- helping to illustrate key points quite handily.  I would definitely recommend to others looking for an overview of sailboats. 
 The book provides excellent discussion and illustration of the inner  workings of electronic payment systems.  This book is good for anyone with  a basic understanding of networking and a desire to learn about current  payment implemtations 
 My oldest daughter received this as a gift when she was three.  She spent hours playing with all the dolls and all of their outfits.  Five years later, my second daughter (who is now 4) pulled them.  She loves them too!  She spends so much time picking out costumes and dresses. And my 3 year old niece pulls them out every time she comes over.  These are much nicer than the ones I had as a kid!  No tabs!  They stick with sticky tape that is easily replaced if needed.  And the book has many different scenes to place the dolls in.  Also there is a nice place in the back of the book to store all the pieces.  They go in these little drawers and dressers and closets that fold back into the book and then close with velcro.  They can get messy when the girls have every single piece spread out on the table, but they sure have fun! 
 This case is much better than the original of Sandisk. There is no dirt adherence as it happens with the one of Sandisk.  The black case gave a beauty touch and protection for my E280 
 MARTINS MICE IS A WONDERFUL  STORY . IF YOU READ IT  YOU WILL NOW FAST LIKE A SPEEDING BULLET . IT HAS FUNNY PICTURES AND THREMENDOUS PARTS . ITS VERY FUNNY IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. BY  - J R  
 In this first volume of the history of civilization, Dr. Durant starts at our beginning.  Most of us in the West have little idea of the impact the East had upon or civilization.  This work changes that and through his wonderful prose, the author gives us a clear insight.  The work is meticulously researched and presented in a fashion that is quite understandable.  Please do not be put off by the sheer poundage of the book. At first glance, as one review pointed out, it can be quite daunting.  I was quite amazed how fast the work went once I started to actually read the thing, rather than stare at it on the shelf.  Will Durants multi-volume work should be required reading in all of our schools.  Perhaps if it were, we, as a society, would have a greater understanding where we have been, ergo, have a greater understanding of where we are going.  Overall, I highly recommend. 
 As you progress through the pages of this peek into the lore of this mystical land, let your imagination run free while you allow Brian Froud and Alan Lee to weave a mystical spell of enchanted wonder, enveloping you with a sense of surreal, fantastical imaginings.  This is the most fun I've had between the pages of a book in a long time!  A word to the wise for anyone expecting a sketch book full of dainty little girls with gossamer wings: the nightmares are not relegated to the back of a dusty shelf here.  From Faerie Flora to the hideous Jenny Greenteeth, all the Fae folk are portrayed, both good and bad, pretty and ugly, helpful and mischievous.  The stunning artwork is visionary in capturing the intrinsic mystery of this egnimatic, unseen world and its phantasmic population.  The handwritten notes add to the captivating essence of the stories in an informal and comfortable way.  If I could change anything at all, I would wish that the pages were numbered and included a table of contents, so I could more easily flip to my favorites.  I would recommend this book to anyone who still wants to believe in magic, and to anyone who wants to reconnect with their childlike sense of wonder.  You may be left with the belief that anything is possible . . .  
 Used to watch this religiously as a wee lad in the decade of Reaganomics and jelly slippers.  Thank you MGM for finally making this available to fans.   Great film. Sparse DVD... but hey, if I can own 'Night of the Comet' in a digital format, I'm a happy movie buff.  DMK will always rule the arcade! Believe it! Buy this now 
 The entire series of Bragg books and products will save your life! Jack LaLanne states; "he would have been dead at age 16 if he had not attended The Braggs Crusade". He is a product today at age 90, of how living the principes of Patricia Bragg and Paul Bragg, M.D. Ph.D is mere proof. Must read the entire series, if you want to feel good and stay forever young 
 I do training for an association in which we are members. Although the exercises in this book are for sales people, I have adapted more than a dozen of them to use in various training sessions, from surviving or thriving in our changed economy to direct marketing by snail mail and email. Would recommend this book to anyone who needs visuals to motivate others 
 If your a parent and having trouble teaching your children about economy then this is the book for you. It help me with my children very much. This book has many was to help you teach your children and may even teach you a thing or two. So if you need help then get this book 
 I had already read Simple Havana Melody and Mr. Ives Christmas and was developing a deep admiration for Oscar Hijuelos' talent as a writer. Since this is his best known work I knew I had to check it out. It is a very engaging book about Cuban brothers trying to make it in the US during the 50's Mambo craze. The story is very entertaining as many memorable characters both fictional and real Cuban musicians from the period are introduced.  The story while full of colorful epsiodes is ultimately tragic as the brothers age and life takes it's toll on each of them in very different ways. Hijuelos uses sexual imagery and descriptions of food to create a steamy  intensity to the story with great effect. That said the lurid sexual descriptions cited by many other reviewers may turn off some readers. While I was enjoying the book enough to overlook this, there are times when he does rely too much on this device and the novel starts to feel like a guilty pleasure. If you are OK with that type of writing then there are rewards to be had in the characterizations and plot. If you cannot stomach the hard-core sexual references that are integral to this book then stay away and try one of his other novels. 
 The adapter worked just fine, but one small fault is that it blocks the flash.  It was just something I failed to take into account 
 "Boy" is the lead-off track from the new Erasure acoustic album "Union Street," to be released in April.  This EP contains other acoustic tracks not included on the album, and a new ambient synth piece from Vince Clark.  "Boy" (not to be confused with the old Book of Love club hit) is reworking of the 1997 original, and seems as if it had been written with this new arrangement in mind.  The gentle guitars allow Andy Bell an unobtrusive backing on which to work his vocal magic--the standout track on this EP.  This EP will not be released on CD in the US, only via download, so if you want the physical object, you need to buy this import.  "Cry So Easy" has the original 1985 vocals paired with new instrumentation--this is why it was not included on the album, which includes all new vocals.  "I Bet You're Mad At Me" is taken from a BBC radio session from 2005.  "Jacques Cousteau" is the ambient piece.  All in all, a must have for Erasure fans.  Can't wait for the album 
 Another wonderful book on the evolution problems.  People who are blinded by Darwinism should keep an open mind and set aside their biases when reading through these chapters.  Otherwise they will miss the point if they are just trying to find something to pick on.  This book shows us that there are more windows to open in the evolution issue.  Everytime we learn more about the complexity of life we see more evidence of design and how very little evidence there is of evolution.  It is high time for science to grow up and not rest on old Darwin's ideas and faith.  The biochemists, mathematicians, biologists, paleontologists, and other scientists are waking up and showing us that its time to move on.  Evolutionists need to realize that science has to change.  Old theories become obsolete when there is new information and that they can't hold on to their faith on evolution forever.  Science textbooks in our children's schools need a major help especially since they are misleading so many young minds.  There is so much things that need to be corrected, especially the outdated "proofs" of evolution.  There is nothing to be afraid of, just show the facts and allow people's minds to make their own decision, if given the opportunity to see both sides of the issue.  Give the students a chance to learn real science, not science fiction.    Evolutionists should also learn to face the issues and not attack a person who questions their belief system.  I am tired of hearing well known scientists who act like immature teenagers by labeling or attacking anyone's character just because they don't agree with evolution.  It is false to say that anyone who doesn't agree with evolution is clueless.  Just because a person doesn't reach the same conclusion that an evolutionist has doesn't prove that the person is unintelligent.  Grow up people- I don't care how many letters you have after your name, you're supposed to be professionals so act like one 
 I read this entire book on a flight from London back to the U.S. When I got home, I rented/watched several of the movies mentioned by Truffaut (Rear Window, etc.) watching for the points he made. Many people don't know Truffaut was a journalist as well as a filmmaker. He was able to write as desriptively as his films were imaginative. My only complaint is that this is a book for serious film fans who have already seen the movies he reviews. If you haven't seen the films, his comments aren't referential enough to include you. But, that said, it will help you see many titles in a new way 
 After 2 1/2 years of watching my husband on a downward slope with Rhuematoid Arthritis.  We put him on the anti-biotic protocol recommended in this book.  What a difference in 6 weeks. The exaustion and morning stiffness is a thing of the past and his inflamation is down by 40%. This book is excellent.  The only thing offered by his rheumatologist was Methotrexate (a chemo-therapy drug that caused terrible side-affects). Then he offered us Embril which isn't covered by our insurance.  It would have ment $12,000 a year out of pocket.  I started doing research into other alternatives and came across this book.  This therapy is CHEAP.  I guess it's not out there because there is no money in it and rheumatology would end as a specialty because any GP can perscribe this therapy. This book can change a chronic deteriorating condition where you are told to learn to live with it, to a treatable infectous disease 
 Deftly edited by Olivier Zunz (Commonwealth Professor of History, University of Virginia), Democracy In America 1835-40 presents the classic text written by Alexis de Tocqueville in a new English translation by Arthur Goldhammer that smoothly captures the sheen of Tocqueville's literary style while faithfully rendering the depth and scope of his ideas. Tocqueville was a Frenchman who visited the United States in 1831 for nine months, conducting interviews with more than 200 people on American politics, law, and social practices. His reflections on the "great democratic revolution" transforming the Western world are insightful, inspirational, and continue to offer a timeless depth from a seasoned perspective which has been appreciated by generations of historians, academics and scholars for almost 175 years now 
 I loved this book, it is so well done! I really enjoy it!! 
 When I first saw this book, I thought that it would be like the awful textbooks they force you to read in schools across the country (i.e. "and then Washington retired, and Adams became president,etc.,etc."), but it wasn't boring at all. Joy Hakim's fabulous writing and the fun facts and illustrations scattered throughout this book make history seem like an ongoing story, instead of an endless monologue. Good for kids and adults alike 
 The best science & technology encyclopedia of its class (affordable desktop size of less than 1000 pages). Articles are lengthy and meaty. Well indexed and well illustrated; excellent cross-indexing indicating pre- and post- requisite articles. Content of articles is very up to date and just right regarding level of sophistication for the intelligent lay public: not watered down yet not too difficult. Articles are interesting and thought provoking, taking the reader beyond mere comprehension of empirical scientific facts toward deeper understanding and meaning 
 A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the "sturdy" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands.  Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent.  A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.  The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her.  In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of "his" child.  He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist.  Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper.  Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.    Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically.  The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her.  To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life.  Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government.  Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.  Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living.  The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader.  Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to  outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. n Mary Whipple  
 We bought this for our 2 daughters.  Yes, there are little tiny pieces and yes, it does take a long time to put these all up.  However, the end result is so great.  There are enough stars to cover the ceiling and the walls so that it really does feel like you are out under the stars. The sticker pieces don't hold the glow as long as the plastic pieces but the whole effect in the room is wonderful.  It lasts at least an hour.  I had a similar set in my son's room when he was younger. That set didn't glow for nearly as long as these stars do.  Now at bedtime, we all head into the girls room to enjoy the effect 
 Julia Roberts gave a brilliant performance here as Erin Brockovich, a single mother who's temper is about as short as her skirts.  When she loses her case against the doctor who caused the car accident she was involved in she somewhat forces her way into a clerical job at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer that lost her case.  After reading a few files and growing genuinely concerned about a few clients Erin decides to investigate a case involving poisoned water supply that is slowing killing off the residents in Hinkley, California.  Julia gives such an effortless performance here that she doesn't even appear to be acting.  Everything is so natural, and that can be said for her cast mates as well.  Albert Finney is brilliant as the lawyer who's as offset as he is intrigued by his new employee's personality.  He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received.  This film, if nothing else, is a beautiful canvas for these talented actors, but acting aside, the script helps move the film along effortlessly and smoothly offering a top notch movie experience that never grows weary or tired 
 An emotional journey from start to finish.  One of the best albums of 2004, in any genre 
 Mooch and Earl though total opposites in intelligence they remain the best of friends! A good comic strip for those who like heartwarming    but funny stories. I especially love "shtinky"! he is so adorable. Loads of  fun! you'll eat it up 
 I had plans of using this book for my master's thesis, but was unable to focus on the concept of feasting in the end (the thesis took on another direction). I wrote my master's a few years ago, and have never forgotten the excellent scholarship of Michel Jeanneret.   Jeanneret is able to pull from a number of disciplines and, as a result, this work demonstrates the complexity of the Renaissance. His sensitivity and acute understanding of this time period allows him to pursue interesting angles on the meaning of feasting. He also displays a self-reflexive attitude towards his own scholarship, thus adding yet another dimension to this work.  It is scholarship that reminds me of Huizinga, Burckhardt, Pleij, etc. Even if this isn't within your own field of research (if you happen to be a graduate student or professor), this book is well worth reading. 
 This is a book that has the answers to all of your questions about horses and a whole lot more. It has 25 black and white drawings and discusses the nature and history of the horse. This book is for horsewatchers everywhere.  You don't need to have spent years in the saddle to enjoy this book. Morris  focuses on the horses strength, speed, nobility, and extreme grace and  beauty 
 When I'm not carrying this book, it's carrying me.  These are the mountains of your heart 
 Reading the reviews, I noticed that "Dr. Trinidad" gives the novel one star using words like "porely," "obsure," "innanities," and "segways."  Okay, Pynchon doesn't appeal to the illiterate ... point exemplified.  People who can spell and read might like the novel, however 
 In Mukul Pandya and Robbie Shell's profile of the top 25 business leaders today, "Lasting Leadership", they cite one above all others, Intel's CEO Andy Grove. The one chapter on Grove (appropriately entitled "Best of the Best") certainly whet my appetite for Harvard Business School professor and historian Richard Tedlow's full-fledged biography, which turns out to be not only a thoughtful profile of Grove but also a fascinating historical overview of the technology industry. How these two aspects intertwine provides the most provocative parts of the book, in particular, how Grove's visionary acumen anticipated the growing demand for instant information and how the personal computer was to become a mandatory household and office item.  Nonetheless, the more personal story behind Grove will interest many readers since his background reflects a remarkable transformation under the most adverse of circumstances. Born a Jew in 1936 Nazi-occupied Hungary when anti-Semitic laws were being fully enforced, Grove managed to survive not only the Nazi regime but the post-WWII Communist takeover. During the bloody Hungarian Revolution, he left his family and escaped to the U.S. when he was twenty. Penniless, he worked his way to a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Berkeley in 1963. He worked his way up from Fairchild Semiconductors, where they introduced the first integrated circuit, to become the fourth employee of Intel and begin an impressive upward climb.  This is where Tedlow provides sharp insight into Grove's clever navigation though Intel's management structure under co-founders Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce, and more importantly, how Grove became an acknowledged leader in Silicon Valley for his groundbreaking thinking. The author vividly shows how Grove transformed the company in 1986 from a memory device company to one focused on microprocessors in response to the cannibalization of the memory market by the then-threatening Japanese. Intriguingly, Tedlow ties the fears imbedded in Grove's persecution-filled childhood in Hungary to the fears he used as a motivating force to move ahead of the competition at Intel. It became clear that Grove knew a sense of certainty and constancy would be tantamount to suicide when it came to making the company thrive, and as Tedlow meticulously chronicles, his management team often felt the heat of his tension-driven style.  There is no challenging the results of Grove's approach as Intel became the world's largest semiconductor company during his tenure. However, what I like most is how Tedlow dissects Grove's public failures as an essential part of his profile. The most egregious moment came in 1994 when Grove publicly denounced critics who found flaws in Intel's new Pentium processor. His stubbornness to acknowledge the problem showed him to be nakedly unaware of the evolution of Intel into a branded consumer product company, how quickly the Internet was disseminating information, and how customers were elevating their expectations in getting that information without fail. Nonetheless, strategic mistakes are all part of Grove's makeup as he rolls the dice with the high-stakes entrepreneurial fervor necessary to thrive in a global economy now being gobbled up by China and others. Tedlow makes Grove's unbendable spirit palpable in these pages 
 Proto-punk, hard rock, acid rock, three-chord garage anthems - it all starts here. Iggy Pop takes Jim Morrison's confrontational stance three cocky steps forward and snarls his way from start to finish. His inspiration by the Doors is obvious, and he has the same lizard charisma as Morrison, but he doesn't rip him off. Ig has his own agenda.  This album is a different type of acid rock - oh, it's psychedlic alright, but without the flower-power mentality. It's a monument to boredom and alienation, as best evidenced on the acid-drenched tracks like "1969" ("It's another year for me and you/Another year with nothin' to do"), "No Fun", "Not Right" and the sledgehammer blues of "I Wanna Be Your Dog." The moody, druggy Doors-like "We Will Fall" is most effective if listened to late at night. With its slow, cult-like chanting, wah-wah overtones and somber viola at the end (courtesy of John Cale), this song would work well in a horror movie.  "No Fun" features Ron Asheton diving head first into guitar fuzz, and it's nothing short of brilliant, while "Real Cool Time" and "Little Doll" are yet more loud, assaultive wah-wah guiatar tracks. The Doors influence resurfaces on "Ann," a slow number where Ig croons like Morrison before him, but gets louder and louder before shouting his way through the track.  This ain't the best album by the Stooges (the distinction probably goes to "Funhouse") but it's the best example of basic, primitive, three-chord garage rock. Despite its trippy sound, it's easy to see why it became a blueprint for punk rockers a few years later (The Ramones, The Dictators, Suicide, Dead Boys and the Clash all credit this band and album as an influence). Recording this might have been "No Fun" for the band but that's not the case in listening to this. 
 Although this is not an exciting book, it is highly informative and well-written. Watt makes a case for why Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding all have a claim to the paternity of the novel.  Laborious academic bloviation is relatively nonexistent in The Rise of the Novel, and if you do much of this type of reading, you know that's a plus.  Even if your focus is not Defoe, Richardson, or Fielding, this book is important to read, just so you understand where your writing fits in the greater literary tradition, or even to give contemporary writers context 
 I sit writing this review from a beach chair.  Since the day is gorgeous, I anticipate the sort of joy Hemingway celebrates.  Among other things, he was a connoisseur of the natural world.  He was also a connoisseur of the sorts of emotion experienced as one looks forward to an adventure. The book is dedicated to EW's first wife and his child.  The first copyright is 1926, eighty years ago.    Robert Cohn boxed at Princeton to overcome feelings of inferiority and shyness.  He fought only in the gym.  In Paris he read books, wrote a novel, played tennis and bridge, and boxed.  Robert went back to America with his novel.  The publishers praised the work.  Returning to France, Robert had become a very successful bridge player and had learned that women liked him.  He asked Jake Barnes, the books narreator, to go with him to South America, having read W.H. Hudson.  Robert Cohn became interested in Brett, Lady Ashley.  Jake's head worked on old grievances.  It was a rotten way to be wounded and it was a joke.  Jake started to cry thinking he wouldn't have Brett.  Brett is getting a divorce and she intends to marry Mike Campbell.  At the Cafe Select Jake encounters Harvey Stone.  In trying to begin his second book, Robert Cohn has lost his sureness.  Jake begs Brett for them to live together.  She says that it would not work.    Jake plans to shove off to Spain with Bill Gorton at the end of June.  They are to go to the fiesta in Pamplona.  Mike Campbell and Brett and Robert Cohn will also go to Pamplona.  Robert Cohn, naive, brings out the worst in everybody.  Jake admits to Bill that he has been in love with Brett, on and off, for a long time.  The members of the party stay at the Montoya Hotel.  Senor Montoya asks Jake if Bill is another aficionado.  At Pamplona Jake is reading a story in THE SPORTSMAN'S SKETCHES.  Jake hears Brett and Robert climb the stairs in each other's company.  There is a big religious procession.  San Fermin is transferred from church to church.    Pedro Romero, a new matador, is outstanding.  He keeps a pure line facing the maximum amount of danger in the presence of the bull.  It seems that Pedro Romero learned some English in Gilbraltar.  Brett tells Jake she believes she is in love with Pedro Romero.  Mike announces that Brett has gone off with the bull fighter chap.  Later, summoned, Brett and Jake rendez-vous in Madrid.         
 Ride The High Country is one of those curious works of art that bridges the past and the present, combining the best of both worlds while being extremely enriching and satisfying on its own merits. The first major film of legendary film director Sam Peckinpah, it stands with his other Western film The Wild Bunch as two of the greatest film of its, or any other genre.  Featuring two actors who were indivisibly synomous with Western films, Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott, and featuring supporting performances by Ron Starr, Mariette Hartley, RG Armstrong, Warren Oates, LQ Jones, James Drury and Edgar Buchanan, the film tells what seems like a fairly simple story, and makes it violently poetic and elegiac all at once.  McCrea and Scott play two aging ex-lawmen who are living out their remaining years in vastly different ways. McCrea picks up odd transport and security jobs because he's now too old to be a lawman. Scott performs in a Wild West show because he'd rather act that cling to a life of serving the law. When McCrea asks Scott's help in transporting miners' gold, Scott sees an opportunity to get rich quick, and along with his young sidekick, join McCrea in the hopes of convincing McCrea of running off with the gold. Along the way, they run into a sheltered farm girl who runs off and marries Drury, who comes from a family of backwoods maniacs. And so the story goes... Ride The High Country is traditional in its casting of solid, if older Western stars like McCrea and Scott, traditional in the values espoused by McCrea, those of loyalty, honor, and sacrifice. The film is modern in how it depicts the two older men as products of a rapidly bygone era that is not loyal, does not honor, and in fact sacrifices them at the expense of modern life. The film has its cake and eats it too because it is wonderfully made, wonderful written, and wonderfully acted.  Randolph Scott, who by the time this movie was made had become a very wealthy man who made movies for the enjoyment and not out of necessity, left acting forever after appearing in Ride The High Country. He knew he would never make a greater film, and in fact, this was the best Western he ever made, even surpassing the great Western he made with Budd Boetticher.  Ride The High Country will always be mentioned when great Westerns and great films of all kinds are discussed 
 This book is an easy and enjoyable read about a difficult philosophical topic.  It deals with the practical reality of the exisence of evil and ties it to a combination of random chance and people's free will.  That is the underlying thesis and deep philosophical arguments are avoided.  What this book does have is practical wisdom and common sense arguments.  I think this is what the average reader is looking for and Rabbi Kushner achieves this gold within a Judeo-Christian worldview.  However, his arguments would appeal to people of many traditions.  At a minimum, the text would be good food for those who embrace vastly different worldviews.  I rated this book a 4 rather than 5 primarily because I would have liked to have seen a bit more philosophical depth.  However, I still think the book is well worth reading for all of the reasons I mention above.  This is high quality, but not the right book to weigh various perspectives and contast them 
 This little gem features brightly-colored pages and vivid photographs. Each page salutes a different color, with photos of kids dressed in the featured color, appropriate fruits, etc. The lively colors, combined with baby faces, captures a little one's interest. Appropriate to start reading with your little one right away 
 Wow! Over a decade after I first picked this book up, I remain impressed  with its clarity and thoroughness. Finnis's range and comprehensiveness are  remarkable. Those who know Finnis only for his--regrettable and thoroughly  inappropriate--support of Colorado Amendment 2 or his opposition to  contraception may think of him as a stuffy fuddy-duddy. But such an  assessment--utterly unfair--would all too likely blind prospective readers  to the many virtues of the position he develops here and in _Fundamentals  of Ethics_. In evidence here is the Finnis critical of Nozick's libertarian  views of redistribution and implacably opposed to strategic nuclear  weapons--hardly the right-wing ogre some of his detractors may suppose him  to be. For those who find Kantian moral theory sterile, consequentialism  unjust, and intuitionist approaches unclear, Finnis presents an impressive  alternative in the Thomist tradition. There's something here for  everyone--lawyers, ethicists, political theorists, and theologians will all  be stimulated by Finnis's reflections. This book is a call to personal  integrity and to political justice that deserves to be heeded 
 I bought this book just for it's large print and short sentences. (ez reader). despite these two 'requisites', this is not just a baby book!  If you want to introduce your child to the 'flow' of eloquent vocabulary, this book should do it! It is NOT a dumbed-down baby book. It is much more fun for me, as a parent, to read than any other baby book that I have met so far! I can see why the baby's (in other reviews) prefer it!! My six year old (learning to read) loves it, too 
 This book is excellent.  It really defines the role and job of a special education teacher.  In fact my principal was so impressed with it that he ordered it for all the special education teachers in my building.  Another principal also ordered it for her special education teachers. 
 I've owned and use the Sony 256MB Memory Stick Pro pictured (in black), and currently also use a 1GB Sony Memory Stick Pro. I've not had any problems with them, formatting or otherwise, over long periods of heavy use. OK, a little pricier than, say, SD cards, but a good quality product for Sony digital cameras. 
 While the CD-based setup didn't work, manual configuration was straightforward.  Security options intuitively placed within the configuration menu. Have helped 2 friends purchase this router since my acquisition 
 In" Abracadabra," Grandma Poss has changes her granddaughter, Hush, purely invisible with her Bush Magic. Hush and Grandma Poss are both cheerful and happy possums, but now Hush is totally invisible. The main reason Grandma Poss turns her invisible is now the dreaded snakes can't see her or the big koalas can't sit on her. For a long time Hush lives contented being invisible, but one day she decides she doesn't want to be invisible any longer. She wants to see what she looks like and play like a normal possum. So Hush goes to Grandma Poss and tells her she wants to be visible again. The only problem is Grandma Poss can't remember how to make Hush visible again. Will Grandma Poss remember how to make Hush visible again or will Hush have to live invisibly miserable for the rest of her life? 	If you like fantasy genres and personification in your stories, you will enjoy this book. This is a cute well-written book. It has a hopeful ending to it and I really thought it had a flowing feel to it, going from one thing to another. To read this book, you have to have some sophistication and know what invisible and visible mean.  Overall, this book was cute and enjoyable. 
 I am not a lawyer, I am not in law school, but I do have interest in the law and legal issues. I've seen the movie one or two times, but the book is WAAAAAY better. The movie is barely a summary of what the book contains.  The story itself it quite good and kept me turning pages. I've also read the Buffalo Creek Disaster and I think this one is a little better, although I highly recommend Buffalo Creek as well 
 Love this book. It is user friendly . I bought it to help brush up my grammar so I could learn another language . It is very goo 
 This book is wonderful.  The pictures are very clear and helpful.  It also has all sorts of information about the different types of fabric and string, etc.   I recommend for anyone, especially beginners like me! Wonderful book 
 I would recommend this handbook to anyone who may be seeking an alternative medicine for cancer, rather than the chemotherapy and radiation.  We chose Essiac Tea, and my husband is cancer free.  This info,  along with the power of prayer and faith, will give you a new perspective.  It did for us.  Best of luck to you 
 Great mystery!  Turns at every corner.  Excellent beach read.  You'll enjoy this one 
 My six year old loved this christmas present.  He and his four year old sister spent several hours christmas day racing to load more marbles on the track.  I get to help contruct and reconstruct the different patterns, which I also enjoy.  This is a high quality and fun toy.  
 Lincoln is one of the best Tmbg albums. When you listen to this cd youll listen to it all day. and youll say "this is the most fabintastic cd everrr.. 
 This book makes anyone reconsider deeply what they believe about others.  Exploring the complex thoughts and emotions of a young disabled teen, the book is thought-provoking and you will still be thinking about it weeks later.  The book is well-written, although sometimes slow, and has fascinating characters with an interesting plot.  Although bored at times, I was still touched by the book's message weeks later.  `Stuck in Neutral' is a wonderful book and fully deserving of five stars.  I hope that you will read this book; it truly opens your eyes. 
 I bought this book for my 4 year old grandaughter after members of the symphony visted her pre-school.  The illustrations are beautiful and the animal musicians kept her interest as we talked about each of the instruments.  The book is a wonderful way to intoduce any child to the joys of music 
 I just finished this book in the series which i only started reading about five months ago.  And i've already started on the next one.  I buy two or three at a time so that i won't run out of Anita Blake.  That is the advantage of getting started late in a series.  I think this one is the one i've liked best so far.  And its the first one about which i have written a review.  Anita is tough, smart, and stubborn to a fault.  The book manages to be both funny and violent and sexy all at the same time.  Although i must say that a lot of reviews written give the impression that the Anita Blake series is erotic and full of blatant sexuality, but it isn't.  In eight books so far, we have only gotten two sex scenes which involve Anita and a couple of other scenes which involved lesser charachters.  If you added up all the sex scenes in all eight books so far, there aren't more than four, possibly five.  They are all written in very good taste, or in other words, they are tame by comparison.  When i first started reading this series i was expecting almost a version of Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy set in a vampire and werewolf infested modern day St. Louis.  But it is not at all erotic.  It is not at all what so many reviews seem to make it out to be.  Do not read this series if you are expecting a little bit of story and action wrapped up in an essentially erotic/romantic package.  Do read this series if you love witty dialogue, strong women, fast paced action, great mystery, unique fantasy lore, and staying up way past your bedtime because you can't bear to put the book down. 
 I bought this CD as a Christmas gift, so I haven't heard it yet. But the tracks I've heard elsewhere are awesome 
 Smitten was written before Stephanie Plum began.  This is the fifth of nine quirky romances that Janet Evanovich wrote between 1988 and 1992.    If you read Smitten without having read the Stephanie Plum novels, you would probably rate the book high for fun and wackiness, above average for plot development and appeal of characters, average for character development and below average for being too predictable.  But if you know Stephanie, you have several extra ways to enjoy this book:  By seeing how Janet Evanovich has changed her style of writing romantic comedies.  That's what moves this warm-hearted, PG-13 novel above average.  Lizabeth Kane is a well-educated 32-year-old daughter of a wealthy family who has been recently been divorced by a philandering husband with pretensions.  She also owns a fixer-upper that she doesn't know how to fix.  Money needs to come in to meet the mortgage payments to feed her two sons and ravenous dog, Ferguson (a Marley-like misbehaving dog before anyone knew about Marley).  Jobs are hard to find.  She's viewed as either overqualified (with her college degree from Amherst) or as inexperienced.  Noting that new homes are being added in the neighborhood, she applies to Matt Hallahan, a hunky contractor of her own age who likes Harleys and sports a tattoo in Chinese.  She gets the job based on lust at first sight.  The romance quickly blossoms.  To care for her sons over the summer while she paints trim and hammers an occasional nail, Lizabeth asks her aunt, Elsie Hawkins, to visit.  Elsie avoids funeral homes but she has many features that help identify her as a prototype for Grandma Mazur.  In the background, there's some persistent, goofy flasher who doesn't bother Lizabeth and Elsie . . . but annoys Matt enormously.    The story would have been stronger if the romance had proceeded more slowly . . . as it has with Stephanie and Ranger.  But there's a nice feel-good quality to the story that will provide pleasant, easy reading for all but the most critical romance reader.   
 This book offers a variety of solutions for networks with bandwidth-intensive applications. It begins with a description of Hubs and it continues with Switches, Routers and then High speed Routers.  The Book is very simple to read and it contains examples to simplify the understanding of the material.  The author has described a variety of high-speed LANs and WANs with trouble shooting guies and recommended solutions.   John Vacca has done an excellent job in consolidating information on electronic routing of information using, more specifically, CISCO Routers  
 Unlike the follow up CD, The Metropolis Mix, this compilation of music from the hit TV show seems to have a thematic consistency between all the tracks.  Especially cool is the full version of SAVE ME, the theme song.  Good assortment, ideal for you ipod or in your rotation on the CD player 
 Wonderfully done and clear explanation. It should have subtitles in other languages. Dont miss this film 
 What if magic was real, and enjoyed a long tradition? And what if magicians only studied magical history and not magical practice? Then, what if someone discovered the practice of magic again, and brought it back?  This hefty tome by Susanna Clarke explores those ideas, as well as the arrogance and failings of hubris.  It's not a classic good vs. evil story, which is really what I expected when I bought this book at an airport (for the 800 pages of light reading).  It's conflict of the establishment against progress, of innovation versus convention, of the young and the old both grasping for a valid place in the world.  It takes place in early 19th century England, primarily in London although there are forays to the countryside as well as to the French battlefield when Napoleon becomes a nuisance.  The author wrote in what she deemed the period style, but it was much more easily readable than, say, even Victorian (shudder) literature.  She was quite liberal with commas, which certainly lent a degree of credulity to the period writing style.  She also used footnotes throughout the book, and if I were the sort of person annoyed by footnotes, I suppose they would have annoyed me.  But since I'm the sort of person who uses a second bookmark to keep up with even endnotes, and I kind of enjoy flipping back and forth (it burns more calories)I found the footnotes to be a humorous way to give the reader "background" without sacrificing the pace of the story.  The pace of any story that takes 800 pages to tell will occasionally drag.  I really didn't find that to be the case with this book, though, until very near the end, when poor Jonathan Strange spent entirely too much time in Italy and not nearly enough time arguing with Mr. Norrell.  I liked their conflicts.   I gave the book to my mom to read.  I figured with her science fiction/fantasy inclinations she'd really enjoy it.  Shows how much I know!  She struggled through it to please me, but the last 100 pages never got read.  How she could have left the story before it was resolved, I will never understand!  But she got bogged down in Venice and just had to extricate herself before she suffocated, I think.   Oh, well.  Thankls, Mom, for trying.  Now I really wish I knew someone else who had read the book so I could talk about it without giving away the many significant plot twists 
 I did like this story - the amnesia angle was written perfectly.  I enjoyed how the story played out very much.  I was learning things at the same time as Riley and found it to be very interesting.  I thought that was fun and refreshing and Hooper did a fantastic job with that aspect.  I think the problem I had was the same as another reviewer.  I didn't really like Riley very much.  There wasn't enough about her that drew me in and made me like her and care about her and her relationship with Asher.  I also didn't like the fact that Riley lost her powers for such an extended length of time.  I like the paranormal aspect of Hooper's novels and that wasn't present for most of the book.  So, 4 stars.  I liked the book and would recommend it but didn't love it.  Not a 5 star effort.  
 Steve Oedekerk (the writer of the film BRUCE ALMIGHTY) directed, wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof. Though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking, KUNG POW is genuinely remarkable, in that much of it is composed of scenes from a 1977 Chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them. Watch the credits at the end for examples of what I'm talking about.  Because of this creative juxtaposition, KUNG POW manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own. It really does "feel" like a vintage martial arts film, yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd, it just wrings laughs out of you.  SIDELIGHT: The entire movie is dubbed, and Oedekerk also did all the voices for every character (except Whoa.) To further the bad dubbing effect, Oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera 
 When my bookclub chose Dry as its selection last month, I dreaded reading this book, thinking it another Frey-esque depressing, graphic addiction memoir and considered even skipping it altogether.  I'm so glad I didn't.  Yes, this is a true story about Burroughs' struggle with alcoholism, but it's so much more than that - it's a story about loneliness gone wild, about loves that we are too daft to acknowledge before they're gone, about how that rattling emptiness inside of us can make us to the most absurd and - sometimes comically, sometimes tragically - destructive things.  I haven't read Running with Scissors, so I can't offer up a comparison, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this and was surprised by its emotional honesty.  
 With a hot summer I found my kids 7 & 10 playing more and more video games - we purchased the eye toy and they had a blast getting up and moving, the interaction was alot of fun. 
 This book is one of the best! Amy has to take care of an ingured pregant horse and is having a rough time at home. This book is really good but #6 is the best so far that I have read 
 scarface put this group together contains rap a lot frontman devin the dude and dmg this whole cd was tight back in 96 and too bad this group did'nt blow up but it was another underrground classic 
 Until last month I didn't read paranormal/vampire/shape shifting/alternate reality romance novels. The only reason I started was because, I wanted to read everything by Nalini Singh I could get my hands on, and just like that I was tumbled headfirst into a genre I had otherwise ignored. Amazon recommended J.R. Ward's "Dark Lover", because I had previously purchased Singh's "Slave to Sensation" (which by the way if you have not read, RUN, do not WALK to buy). So I brought it not expecting too much. I truly enjoyed "DarK Lover". I didn't love it, but out of five stars it definitely rated at least a four. Since I am the type that enjoys an author more for their writing style, then the actual plot, I ordered the following available books in the series.  Oh. My. God. Let me count the ways of how I loved "Lover Eternal". I loved this book, because if I had to handpick a hero or heroine for both THE hero and heroine I couldn't have done a better job. Rhage literally has a devil on his back. He is cursed for past acts, and while he has learned to live with his curse, he counts down to the days he can be free of it. This is a very important aspect to grasp. Mary Luce, is a survivor. She survived cancer with two near deaths, she survived losing her mother to disease, she survives being alone and lonely. Mary doesn't think she's attractive and she's waiting to die, but won't admit she is waiting to die. And since her cancer is back? Chances are? Mary is going to die.  Mary meets Rhage, when her friends require her help. She goes to the Brotherhood house, and runs into a Rhage, who has just done a round the night before with his demon dragon, that is on his back. He can't quite see, so he runs into Mary and is captivated by her voice. He literally falls in love with her voice. Cheesy right? If anyone else but J.R. Ward was writing this book, it would have hit the freaking wall by now. It has every cliché primed to make me throw the book down.  1)	Misunderstood/tortured hero? Check. 2)	Suffering heroine. Check 3)	Deadly disease. Check. 4)	Love at first sight/smell. Check. 5)	Dowdy woman. Check. 6)	Man so beautiful, the waitress at TGI Friday's barely restrained herself from tossing her panties at him. Check. (Okay, so that isn't usually a check, but a man prettier then the heroine, drives me nuts...usually)  But d@rn if by this point I don't have the stupidest grin on my face. Why? Because while there are external issues to keep this human woman and this vampire male apart? Rhage, never lets go. He fights the Lessers, the Brotherhood, Mary, the Scribe Virgin, anyone and anyone that gets in the way of him having "His Mary". I really, truly, truly, loved this book. I read "Dark Lover", "Lover Awakened" and "Lover Revealed" and this book has been my favorite. Although they are ALL fabulous. I am currently, chewing my elbow awaiting "Lover Unbound". Don't dally! Go and get it! NOW. :) 
 This is a must have for fans of the Roswell High books and the TV series, although some of the Roswell info may be wrong its a really great book! I loved the way it was written and the storyline rocked! =0 
 My daughter (3 yrs old) never gets tired of reading this book, and there is so much detail that there is always something new to discover so neither do I!  The extremely dramatic story is exactly what resonates with children - A scared little girl left alone in the house afraid of trolls and who might knock, a brave Daddy that goes out on skis in the cold woods looking everywhere to find the trolls and scare them away, trolls who are knocking, trying to get in and finally burst in, a polar bear that gets poked in the nose, woken up, and roars around chasing them out, and trolls that are bad because they don't share and want to eat everything so poor Kyrie and Daddy don't have anything to eat for Xmas.  Just scary enough with dramatic happy ending, my daughter acts it all out, and we both pick out new pictures all the time (Kyrie sillouette cooking in kitchen, animals in the northern lights, etc.)  An absolute keeper, must buy you'll never tire of story or pictures 
 This book covers a broad spectrum of 'spiritual gardens' from the more specific doctrines such as Zen, through to the individual gardeners' interpretation of what makes a garden a spiritual place. I found it to be a  very good introduction to the subject and the very beautifull photographs  enhance the text extremely well 
 It ain't rocket science.  An A list star, some recognizable character actors, a hot blonde with great legs, snappy dialogue, a wonderful sense of location and just enough violence and action to keep the thing moving.  Dennis Quaid plays a generally decent cop & Ellen Barkin plays an uptight Internal Affairs agent. Of course they hate each other at first but then fall in love and become a crime solving duo.  Neither Barkin nor Quaid are the stars they used to be, so The Big easy isn't watched much anymore. Thats too bad because this is one of the more intelligent and enjoyable action-comedy-romances from the 80's 
 An excellent series of essays by veteran watchers of Afghanistan with much recent experience on the ground.  Goes beyond the myths often repeated in daily papers.  Impartial and rigorous on the Taliban and the nature of its support.  The best book on post-1996 Afghanistan.  I've written three books on Afghanistan myself, so I know a little of the subject 
 This novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction and for good reason. It's superbly written with a keen eye for military and character details. The commanders come alive in this book like in no other except perhaps Shelby Foote's brilliant (non-fiction) trilogy. The movie "Gettysburg" was based on this novel. If you love historical fiction and the Civil War you must read this fantastic book. The author's son has made quite a career (Jeff Shaara) out of writing a series of novels based upon this one - before and after Gettysburg (which is the setting for Killer Angels). Unfortunately, in this instance, the apple fell quite far from the tree as far as writing capabilities are concerned. Steer clear of the Jeff Shaara books and read the non-fiction histories instead. But, if you need a good/great civil war novel, you're likely to find no better one than this 
 I didn't know what HTML was before this book.  Now I can write my own simple webpages.  Excellent 
 Again it is a fun toy to use and it works nicely it has awsome durablety. Finily in close it really works you can realy talk under water and under stand what the other person is saying 
 This collection is good but not great.  The sketches are priceless, but Monty Python does their best stuff when they perform live and only do their most popular sketches. regardless, this is a great dvd for MP lover 
 The best book of its kind,  bar none.  Photos are excellent,  and it is  obvious that the authors really know and love their subject.  Anyone who  has ever spent an evening at the drive-in would love the memories this book  evokes.  Anyone who never had the opportunity to participate in the golden  age of drive-in movies can experience it vicariously through The American  Drive-In Movie Theatre.  I've given several copies as gifts -- Everyone  loves a Drive-In  
 This book was the recommended companion to my math stat's required textbook.  In almost every case where I didn't understand the explanation given in lecture or in the main textbook, I could understand this book's explanation.  I cannot vouch for the entire textbook, but I would not have understood MLE without it.  The one star missing is because of the book's tendency to mention earlier sections of the book, which was frustrating since I was using it as a reference.  Incidentally, I used this edition, but I didn't pay even close to the price here, so definitely comparison shop.  
 This album is top quality stuff. A fine blend of natural talented writing and top drawer session musicians. Stevie Winwood and Noel Gallagher (Oasis). H from Grappenhall, Warrington, England 
 It is true that Jayne Ann Krentz is one of my favorite authors,and this is one of my favorite books!  Jayne has written one of her most memorable female characters: Philadelphia Fox. She is a combination vixen, gamine, everygirl, and passionate lover.  One of her best qualities is her loyalty  to her best friend, especially in the face of opportunity.  The hero is  also an exceptional person, who is honest and fiery.  Both are stubborn,  but they are stubborn together.  What a wonderful love story and  testamonial to love, loyalty and honor.  Who would have thought that  combination would be so exciting 
 I work with kids and I am reading this book with one of the teens and he is also enjoying the book. It is easy to read and it has a great message 
 I have been a fan for 12 years and still love their sound.

 Creating an effective information security infrastructure for a large multi-national company is a challenge. Above and beyond the technology, the software, and the hardware, there are non-tangibles, specificially the cultures and laws where the security solutions, people, and technology will be deployed. Deploying technology without considering the local environment and culture is a sure-fire way to undermine a project.   Today's technology infrastructure is getting more and more complex. Companies are more global with more porous borders. Outsourcing is increasing dramatically, creating an additional need to understand the cultures in the remote locations.   Given all that, Mapping Security: The Corporate Security Sourcebook for Today's Global Economy is a valuable guidebook to deploying information security outside of the United States. Author Tom Patterson is a former Big 4 Information Security partner whose job responsibilities saw him living abroad for much of his adult life. The book is not so much a network security title, but rather a guide to performing the business of security across various cultural and physical borders. Mapping Security is management-level source book for companies and organizations that do - or plan to do - business outside of the United States. Patterson takes his years of living abroad, his successes and his failures, his war stories, and his challenges, and maps them into a usable framework so the reader can better deploy an information security program.   In the book, Patterson details the various opportunities and challenges in each geographic sector across the globe and provides security best practices, rules, and customs for 30 countries. Patterson does a good job of explaining how and where Americans are often perceived to be arrogant by having a overly U.S.-centric view of things.   The book is divided in three parts. Part 1 details the manner in which an effective information security infrastructure can be developed. Chapters 1 through 7 show the necessary steps to building an effective security culture. The book, especially Part 1, is focused not so much on specific technology but rather the processes in which to develop such a security infrastructure.   The heart of the book is in Part 2 where Patterson details his Mapping Security Index (MSI). The function of the MSI is to provide the reader with a metric to determine how an organization can perform security functions in a different country. The book has an MSI for 30 countries, but it does not detail every country, only those where U.S.organizations are likely to do business.   Peterson's expertise comes from living abroad extensively and bringing to the table how business should be done in whatever country you are dealing with. Two of the countries with the highest MSI are Netherlands (90) and Canada (93), with Russia (26) and Saudi Arabia (32) at the bottom. The main advantages of the Netherlands and Canada are that they both have a safe, stable, and effective infrastructure in which to build an information security organization.   Russia, on the other hand, while having a strong technical outsourcing potential has a legal and technical infrastructure that is significantly lacking. Additionally, most other business services are not yet on par with the rest of the region. As to Saudi Arabia, Patterson notes that while it provides a growing domestic marketing, it is an extremely difficult security partner to deal with and has very little cross-border activity. There is extremely little opportunity for women when it comes to the region. He notes that it is practically impossible for women to do business there and observes that "surrendering gender equity is simply the cost of doing business in Saudi Arabia".   Part 3 of the book deals with that challenge of mapping various laws and regulations from different countries. Part of the challenge and headache is dealing with laws from different countries that are contradictory. For example, one country might require an organization to capture and report customer information, while another country forbids it. The question becomes whose law do you break? That is not an easy question to answer, but it is one that needs to be considered.   The author notes that security standards and regulations are the biggest drivers for security around the world and a misstep in dealing with regulations can create the scenario where one could face business impairments, fines, or even prison.   Overall, Mapping Security: The Corporate Security Sourcebook for Today's Global Economy is a very valuable reference guide for anyone who needs to deal with information security in different countries and cultures. By relating security to the international community, the book enables the reader to avoid making those mistakes that can sink a security project.   Patterson has a keen business insight, and the book provides many of his war stories (from illegal barbeques in Germany to an innocuous racial fax paus in South Africa). The book is not overly technical in nature and is both entertaining and informative. For anyone that plans to deploy security outside of the United States Mapping Security should be required reading.

 Wayne Dyer speaks and writes in an absolute mode that appeals to the thinker/seeker. He contends that nothing is an accident, that all has purpose. This is assurance to a large sector of mankind. Dyer is heavy on choice also which makes this work a beautiful paradox. It is uplifting and thought provoking.

 Written with detail, candor and insight, this seems to be the definitive biography of the interesting and eccentric film director. A highly readable account of the man and his movies 
 My sisters already had purchased this item so I got one so we could talk together.  I think it does a good job for the money and we have a lot of fun visiting on it.  
 As an avid reader and historian of Bobby Jones, I can safely say that this is the best writing on Jones since O.B. himself.  With Mark Frost's suspenseful story-telling and prose as graceful as Bobby's golf swing, the reader feels that he or she is walking the fairways with the great champion.  It also provides wonderful insight into Jones' relationship with O.B. Keeler.  Impressive in its detail, movement and knowledge of golf history, this should be in every golfer's library 
 Chomsky's first political book, _American Power_ is a devastating critique for the U.S. foray into Southeast Asia, which Chomsky considers to be little more than modified imperialism.  The book starts somewhat slowly, first with an extended essay focusing largely on the Spanish Civil War, which though interesting, seems like a strange place to begin the discussion. The second essay focuses on the decision of drop nuclear weapons during World War II, and the absence of "war guilt" in the U.S. over that action. The second essay, like the first, is interesting, though not seemingly directly related to Chomsky's Vietnam critique.  The remainder of work focuses quite squarely on Vietnam, and offers the sort of moral outrage that Chomsky contends was conspicuously lacking from the liberal academics of the time.  The entire underpinning of Chomsky's premise has to do with the morality of U.S. action, rather than the pragmatism that he chides others for basing their positions on.   The book is quite powerful in many of its conclusions. A few criticisms: there is extensive use of irony throughout the work, occasionally to the point of excess; while Chomsky eviscerates a half dozen of the "liberal intelligensia", it's difficult for me, as someone who was not alive to witness the war, to know if these voices typify the liberal objections to the war, or if Chomsky has cherry-picked these individuals (obviously Schlesinger was a major voice, but I'm not familiar with the others); if you don't have some conception of the forces behind the Spanish Civil War, the first essay will be somewhat confusing.  It was for me, anyway.  Altogether though, particularly in light the U.S. invasion of Iraq, many of Chomsky's ideas have taken on a new urgency. The comparision between Vietnam and Iraq will come very naturally as you read _American Power_.  It is well worth our time to make this comparison.  Chomsky's thesis is as valid now as it was in 1969 
 Orwell's DOWN & OUT is an amazing book--witty, finely observed, unsentimental, and utterly absorbing. Reminds me of Jack London's PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS, which was a journalistic foray into London's slums circa 1903--about 20 or 25 years before Orwell gave his account of what it was like to be destitute, despised, dirty, and lowdown in Paris and London in the years after WWI. A brilliant, haunting book.. 
 I am an avid fan of the German Shepherd dog and have a small library of books on the breed.  This book holds a place of honor at the top of the stack as one of the most complete breed books I have found.  It appears to be an honest appraisal and history of the breed, but with the obvious  prejudice of an owner.  Her love of her dogs shines through in amost every  page.  That can easily be fogive.  The comparison of the German and  American lines is particularly helpful.  Ms Strickland's knowledge of the  breed and many years of experience are well known and add to the  credibility of her work.  Good job, we look forward to the next update

 Gottman's writing is sincere and easy to read, and his content is phenomenal.  He debunks several myths about successful marriages and marriage counseling, and proceeds to provide real, solid concepts and practical suggestions, including worksheets to take either individually or with your partner.  The single concept I found most eye-opening and potentially life-changing was that there really are unsolveable issues within every relationship - and there are ways of dealing with those issues, including understanding what areas of the issue are and are not negotiable, that make it possible for the relationship to not only survive despite the issue, but survive with humour, affection, and resilience.  If your relationship - doesn't really have to be a marriage - is struggling, this book has the potential to save it.  If your relationship is a good one, this book can make it better.  Highly recommended 
 This episode is a classic, and is one of the best in the series. It explores time travel and alternate time lines, and it's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed. 
 This is a moving story about AIDS. In some areas of southern Africa the life expectancy has been cut in half. The hero of this book is a little boy born in South Africa. His growth was stunted by pediatric AIDS. He lived for 12 1/2 years before he passed away. The author met this little boy who had a wonderful sense of humor. The theme of his life is that he was a "normal" boy. He had a huge infectious smile that everyone loved. This little boy fought for the right to go to school and won that right for himself and others.   In Africa AIDS is a heterosexual disease and a childrens disease. This little boy, Nkosi, fought for the rights of all persons with AIDS. Nkosi had tremendous courage and his mantra was to do all he could in the time he had. He was even the keynote speaker at a major AIDS conference in South Africa. He spoke in front of over 20,000 people at this conference.  Nkosi had a wisdom beyond his years. He was a very smart little boy. He had a sense of himself and was sophisticated far beyond his years. He was always willing to talk about persons with AIDS as he believed it was a cause far bigger than just himself.   Nkosi had a classmate in school who became his best buddy. Nkosi's teacher was just marvelous and treated Nkosi without a stigma. Living to 12 1/2 years Nkosi was one of the longest living pediatric aids babies in South Africa. As you read this wonderful book you will learn all about a this boy's courage and his mother's great love for him.  
 I've been wrestling (teaching it) for twenty years and this is the first book that ever showed all the different styles around the world.  I thought I knew pretty much everything about wrestling but I learned a lot of things I didn't know from Maberry's book.  Also, there was some very informative stuff about martial arts, boxing, fencing...all sorts of stuff.  And the First Aid section is the most complete I've seen in a sports book.  I give this guy two thumbs up 
 Another great Crunch DVD. I love all of Ellen's workouts.  Great cues, great workout, and the music is even ok.  A pilates workout 
 Belle and Sebastian is one of those bands that make consistently great albums. That being said, The boy with the Arab Strap is my favorite of their entire discography. Buy it. You won't regret it. It pretty much leaves Coldplay, Travis, Star sailor, and all of the other bland, pretentious cry babies in the dust 
 I used to be the person carrying around an extra 10 pounds with neither the motivation or the time to exercise a little harder.  When I became engaged last fall, I was determined to have some definition in my arms for my wedding day.  The challenge was, I hate going to the gym and I travel all of the time with my job.  I learned about Wendie's book from a friend and got it immediately.  Packed neatly in my suitcase on every business trip, I went from orering room service and parking myself on the hotel room bed to actually putting Wendie's method to the test.  It was fun and easy and addicting.  In 3 months, I lost 12 lbs, an inch in my biceps and 3 inches in my waist.  This is a perfect program for women business travelers 
 i bought this product almost 2 years ago from another online site and i still love it. the hint to using this product and for it to be effective AND still get multiple uses out of each pad is to make sure you skin is extremely dry. you cannot use the buffer if you have recently used some type of moisturizer. on the day that im going to use it i will not use lotion or a soap with moisturizer in it the day before. if u dont want to do that you can use a soap like ivory to dry out your skin before you use it. just make sure ur completely dry and oil free b4 u use it. also...you cant be in a room with heat. you will sweat and clog the pad. i know this seems like alot but it works and in time its second nature. all in all im done with both legs  in less than 15 minutes 
 whether you believe the myth about the link to the Templars or not, this is a wonderful book and I thoroughly enjoyed it 
 Whether you like your bluegrass traditional, progressive or genre-bending; there is plenty to enjoy on this 49-track, two and a half hour collection from one of the most influential labels in bluegrass music.  This two-CD set reads like a who's who of bluegrass. JD Crowe, Del McCoury, Ricky Skaggs, Tony Rice, David Grisman, Alison Krauss, Tony Trischka...the list goes on and on.  And when you look at the price, this becomes a no-brainer.  Enjoy!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDE 
 The second edition of Land Navigation Handbook (2005) is the best book I have read on the subject of navigation.  The explanations and  expert guidance on choosing and using a compass, the distinction between magnetic and true north, choosing and using a GPS unit, how GPS works and its limitations (not just for north America but for other parts of the world as well) are definitely worth reading.  I have learned a lot from this book.  The book is not for land navigation only, it is also an indispensable aid for marine navigation.  I sincerely think every sailor should have one in his sailboat (it measures only 8" x 4.5" x 0.5") as a reference book 
 Each chapter of this book is an old article from the good years of Rudder Magazine (1893 - ~1950).  I now see why the magaize has such an excellent reputation.  The book is full of very interesting, practical and relevant information from real experts about both sailing a power boating.  Also the authors are often very opinionated, and I find that extremely entertaining and useful.  Today's magazines are largely of forum for advertisers, and the editors often write what pleases the advertisers (their primary source of $ is advertising, not subscription fees).  I have more confidence in the advice of experts who have nothing to gain (this book), than the happy go lucky stories and product reviews of today's magazines.  If you don't like all of the ridiculusly positive reviews, shiny products, and promotion of excessive reliance on systems, then skip today's magazines.  If instead you believe sailing and cruising is about depending on your own competence with basic skills, knowlege and experience, then this should be excellent and informative reading.  The information here is very relevant today: Boats still float, the wind still blows, and the sails still fill, good seamanship has not changed.  I would take one issue of Rudder Magazine over a year long subscribtion of today's magazines (Sail Mag., Cruising World... 
 Watching this movie will be a Christmas tradition from now on. The movie is EXCELLENT! It is very true to the book which is one of my favorites.This movie would make an excellent gift for anyone. I highly recomend it...... 
 Good information about food and health.  A little too extreme in how one should live and eat for many to follow.  But certainly a good guide 
 Daphne Gottlieb, Jokes and the Unconscious (Cleis Press, 2006)  I'll start off this review with a bit of unsolicited honesty: I'm not a huge fan of either Daphne Gottlieb's poetry or Diane DiMassa's comics. Jokes and the Unconscious, however, once I got the hang of what they were doing, was quite a pleasant surprise.  Sasha is a student working at a summer job at a medical facility. She spends roughly equal amounts of time attempting (and failing) to avoid her co-workers, flagrantly violating the HIPAA laws, and telling us, the readers, jokes, all as ways of coming to terms with the death of her father.   Those of you who have already started drawing the Fun Home parallel are on the right track, but the authors approach their similar subject matter from different directions-- Bechdel wrote a book that was incisive, tender, and introverted, while Gottlieb and DiMassa approach from the angle of brash, funny, and a little on the gross side. This is a book to have fun with, and then meditate upon afterwards. *** ½ 
 Gerald A Michaelson is a leading authority in the first and most renowed self-help book the world has ever seen ie Sun Tzu's The Art Of War. This is a rare and outstanding book. In this book, Michaelson masterfully extrapolated Sun Tzu's teachings for personal development and success in a language everybody could understand. It is thus a must reading for everyone who seeks to emulate Sun Tzu's principal solution viz win-win solution. In another words, Sun Tzu emphasises on winning with strategy and this is a counterpoint to the more action-oriented western thinking 
 So what makes a great classic film ? (there are few)  Well, let's start with context.  Here's one of the crown jewels of the French New Wave, that band of autuers who rose up in the late 50's to change the way the rest of us looked at film.  And why?  Hiroshima,mon amour is the grand-daddy of the time/memory gang --the films you so like to try to figure out today like Momento, or David Lynch, or the latest every-thing-is-upside-down-and backwards type of film. It's a film that got everyone excited.  It's mix of past and present--war torn France and post-war Hiroshima--of regret and nostalghia, guilt, horror of the past, etc. simply had not seen the light of day before.  Then there's the visual scheme--almost every shot in the film could stand as a fine photo by itself. (That spells c-l-a-s-s-i-c.)  A script that's blatantly poetic-not a compromise in sight. Add to that some admirably understated performances, a little nudity, and a profundo-unprecedented pace-- don't run, walk slowly.  Brilliant intercutting, startling images.  That all said, it's a classic that will probably drive viewers used to "fast,plot driven films" batty.  But if your interested in the history of film, open to a challenge, want to discover new ways of looking at film, then this work of art (it is defintely that) is something you might find not only tolerable, but even inspiring.  
 Still extremely popular 110 years after being first produced at the St James Theatre. Full of Oscar Wilde's characteristic repartee, sparkling wit and epigrams.  The humour is as current today as it was in 1895. Two young man, Jack and Algernon, woo their respective young sweethearts by claming the name of Ernest, creating great confusion.  Due to his seemingly dubious birth, Jack is prevented from marrying his beloved Gwendolyn, by her insufferable guardian, Lady Bracknell, while Jack is not quite happy about the debonair Algernon wooing his charge, the charming young Cecily.   But all is well that ends well and circumstances; through a remarkable twist work out just fine.  One of the  best loved works of the master, Oscar Wilde. 
 The musicianship displayed by Ravi Shankar here is absolutely phenomenal!  I am fairly new to the works of Shankar, this is only the 5th cd of his I've heard.  By far though, it is the best.  I am not 100% knowledgeble on  the techniques and characteristics of Indian music yet as I am a novice, I  am basing this review mostly on how the music makes me feel.  The sound  quality is incredibly crisp and life like; sounds just like it was recorded  yesterday!  Considering this was originally recorded in 1964 the sound here  is very impressive, a very good remastering job!  The liner notes are very  informative, yet thankfully brief.  They give a nice run down of ragas and  so forth, in terminology that non-seasoned listeners like myself can  comprehend.  An excellent choice for the relatively low cost!  I would  definitely recommend this for newcomers to the wonderful world of sitar  music 
 A Time to Love, by Robert Greenberger, is the fifth book in the Time to... series of Star Trek: The Next Generation novels, taking place immediately before the movie Star Trek: Nemesis.  The first four books were up and down affairs, wallowing in Trek continuity and occasionally telling a good story.  A Time to Love, however, is the first one that's been fully satisfying.  It is rather lightweight, but for some reason it packs a punch.  It begins the story of how William Riker, first officer of the Enterprise, finally finds himself with a command of his own after all these years under Captain Picard.  While concentrating on this and his relationship with Deanna Troi, the book also tells a great story too.  A Time to Love is a short book (263 pages), but somehow Greenberger packs a lot into it.  The first ten pages are a little slow as he summarizes what's happened so far in the series, but he does it in an interesting fashion:  having Troi and Riker going through crew transfer applications, commenting on what's happened so far and how it's affecting morale.  This scene is also important as it begins the realization, carried throughout this book and the next, that Riker has to finally make a decision about his life.  He's 42 years old, he and Troi have rekindled their romance (in the movie Insurrection, but they haven't moved forward. Just what is he waiting for?  Plus, he has turned down many command opportunities to stay with Enterprise, but is that still the right thing to do?  I've never seen such an effective summary before, giving us new information even as it goes over old.  Some of the later scenes, such as Geordi's, do slow down and tell us too much about the past without anything happening, but those scenes are not very long.  The characterization in this book is wonderful.  Riker and Troi get the most, but everybody else is great too.  Picard is getting fed up with the boring missions that he's been given, mainly to keep Enterprise out of the spotlight and allow time for the furor to die down.  Picard feels put upon, and he wishes for a mission that he can sink his teeth into.  The Delta Sigma IV mission turns out to be just what he asked for, but perhaps too much.  His frustration when the ruling council on Delta Sigma IV is frozen with indecision is palpable, as his annoyance with himself when he realizes that he hasn't kept on top of the situation on the Enterprise very well during the mission.  Crusher's indecision about the offer to head Starfleet Medical is hanging over her head, and she keeps coming to the realization that she and Picard will never have a romantic relationship and she must also look to her career.  In the meantime, though, she is determined to do as much to help the people on the planet below as she is able.   Even better are the scenes with the various security officers as they try to quiet the situation down on the planet before it escalates into even more violence.  We get scene after scene of these officers doing their job, many of which look like they're going to end with the typical "red shirt" ending, but they don't always.  This makes the scenes that *do* contain something bad even more effective.  Greenberger writes these scenes with tension, keeping the reader entranced to know what will happen next.  These scenes also give wonderful characterization to Lt. Vale, the security chief who is responsible for all of these men and women.  Greenberger perhaps has too many times where he says that Vale would give her life for Picard, over-emphasizing it a little bit, but overall her characterization is quite good.  Kyle Riker doesn't figure a lot in this book, except by his absence and the effect of the search for him on Will.  These scenes are extremely effective, with Will contemplating what barriers that have been in the way of the reconciliation of him and his father, as well as taking stock of his life.  Riker is taken on his search by one of the natives and they visit the man's home as well, emphasizing just what Riker has been missing all these years.  While being full of action and conflict (emotional and violent), the book makes a very effective character study of Will, as well as the other regulars.  I found it incredibly entertaining to read.  The only weak spot in the novel (and this may just be setting up something for the next few books) is the Geordi and Data story, where Geordi has to scrounge for parts by trading with various other starships in the area like some supply sergeant.  Data suggests that Geordi become a true supply sergeant by getting everybody's inventory and seeing what they have and what they need, facilitating the delivery of these parts through a Ferengi trader.  This subplot doesn't appear to have anything to do with anything except to give these two major characters something to do.  I hope that changes, but in this book they felt forced into the story, and as short as it is, I think the other storylines could have been developed a bit more.  Still, that is the only true fault.  A Time to Love flows very nicely, flying by as you read it.  The prose isn't wonderful, but it's greatly functional, serving its purpose and getting out of the way.  These are the characters I know and love, and Greenberger manages to tone the angst down considerably.  No mean feat in this series so far.  This is the first true winner in the series.  David Ro 
 I read this book believing it would give me a neutral perspective on the 1967 Arab Israeli war I should have took more care with my choice and took note of who the author was (a BBC Journalist).  The BBC are notorious bias against the Israelis as a result this book is nothing more than another edition in the Insta-book crap collection.  If you want to be an independent thinker and form your opinion on the Israeli-Palestine troubles read Michael B Oren's 'Six days of war' (available on Amazon) 
 Emily Dickinson was a wonderful poet along with Poe...Her poems were mostly about depression, and death. Althought her poems werent found till after she died she still wrote beautiful poems that just want to make you cry. 
 I'd recently read my first Deborah Crombie, Dreaming of the Bones and didn't think it deserved the accolades it received.  Ho-hum plot, tepid characters, etc.  In a Dark House was vastly superior.  The plot was fast-paced (I read this book in two sittings), the characters far more interesting, and mostly, the writing was much richer and more truly "Enlish".  In her other book I felt the author was American trying to write British.  I wish she'd written more about the fire bug--his character was intriguing but only the surface was scratched.  Same for the Elaine character--I wanted to know more about her, her background and what made her feel/behave the way she did.  I will have to read her earlier books in this series to gain a truer understanding of Duncan and Gemma I think.  All in all, a terrific read.  
 My dad suggested I read this, rather casually if I remember correctly.  He said he thought I'd like it, but not much more.  What an understatement!  Just as one of the reviews on the back of the book states, I lost sleep, skipped meals, and was obsessed with what would happen next.  What amazes me most is that this REALLY HAPPENED-and quite recently too.  I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the lack of photos.  I think it was on purpose.  Tommy Thompson didn't get to where he is by overexposing himself or his secrets.  He must have said, one way or another, "I'd rather you not show any pictures, and let the facts speak for themselves".  Gary Kinder has written a masterpiece, plain and simple.  I wish more people knew about this book.  Instead of spending time doing drugs or watching TV, they should read this and be reminded about what it's like to really live.  I felt like I could accomplish anything after reading this book.  I recommend it to everyone.  You won't be sorry-I promise.  Just know you'll sacrifice sleep, food, and most of the rest of your life plowing through this--  
 I picked this book to read about using smartcard and biometrics in j2ee application. I am really amazed to see, this is the only book in the market to illustrate how to put together all three factors of authentication in a j2ee application. More compelling, the authors did a terrific job to cover every possible security option that adds value to j2ee application. The patterns and best practices for application security architecture and design strategies for the presentation tier, business tier, and Webservices tier of j2ee platform are very promising and helpful. Overall this book unites security and identity management technologies and related Java APIs with insightful answers to whys, whens and hows of using them.   A required reading for anyone involved with Java security

 Classic Swartzwelder-ian storytelling about sucky detective Frank Burly who's hired by a homeless man to find out why he went to bed last night in his mansion a millionaire and woke up this morning flat broke in a cardboard box.  Highly imaginative, better than "Double Wonderful" and twice as funny, I had to put the book down about eight times cause I was laughing so hard.  If you love "The Simpsons" then I'm sure you'll get a kick out of this 
 This is not a film with lots of blood and gore. In fact there is no blood and gore. The film "Haunted," was written by James Herbert. I happened to read the book while on a flight from Chicago to L.A., and although I don't read horror books, but do like some of the films in the genre, I found the book interesting and very original. Therefore, I was pleased to see the film when it was released. I believe that this is an underrated gem of a film: And is deserving of 5 stars. David Ash (Aidan Quinn) is a professor who has debunked anything dealing with the supernatural. He has even written a book on the subject. He comes into contact with a woman who has been pleading with him through several letters to help her with the evil spirits in her home.  The woman Nanny Tess (Anna Massey) is excellent in her role. I will not give out any spoilers in this review, as to do so will ruin the film for you. He decides to investigate the womans home. It is a mansion at Edbrook, [Edbrook Mansion]. The mansion is occupied by 3 siblings. Two men and one young woman. The elder brother Robert Mariell (Anthony Andrews) is the leader of these young adults. The sister, Christina, is portrayed by the beautiful (Kate Beckinsale). Not everything is what is seems in this mansion. The family physician, Dr. Doyle is portrayed by (John Gielgud). What David encounters is very shocking and haunting. There is more to the occupants of this mansion than he realizes. The ending is terrific, and totally original. You will enjoy this film. Highly recommended.    
 This is a very interesting book. Athough there is some available literature on the recent advances in complex systems, it is often too general for the readers interested in having a good picture of how the area is developed and what type of (really) new advances are taking place. I think that this book, together with some literature on chaos (particularly Ian Stewart's book "Does God Play Dice?") and self-organization (I would strongly recomend Coveney's book "The Arrow of Time") provides a very useful guide to some of the most interesting findings, particularly within biological sciences. Although the most recent breakthroughs in complex networks are not there (not surprisingly) and the range of topics is certainly broad, I think the authors did a pretty good job in presenting a well-defined picture of the importance of emergence and phase transitions in genetics, ecology, evolution and brain dynamics (to cite just a few). You might agree with their views or not, but I think their enthusiam is contagious and makes you seriouly consider these ideas. The boxes, even if not allways self-contained (more references in the final list would have been helpful) trigger further interest in knowing more about the underlying maths and physics. Given the limitations imposed by a popular science book, I think they did a good job. This book should be a must-read for everyone interested in complex systems but also to those who feel that the analytic (so called reductionist) view of reality needs to be complemented with a wider perspective. I am myself molecular biologist, and in spite of the success of my own field over the last decades, I think it's time for some fresh air. Both approaches are needed and this book can give you a first glimpse of why the two approaches are required. I enjoyed reading it and loved the final paragraph 
 Consider this book a master class in documentary filmmaking.  Megan Cunningham's interviews are incredibly engaging - she manages to at once explore each documentarians' creative process, AND discuss how these various filmmakers achieved their success, AND to discuss specific films in-depth AND to elicit the filmmakers' fascinating views on theoretical issues such as what constitutes "cinema verite" or whether documentaries can be considered art.  Furthermore, Cunningham's book is wonderfully readable and well organized (and full of photos!). I especially enjoyed how Cunningham devoted equal space to such luminaries as Errol Morris and lesser known but equally powerful documentarians such as Lauren Lazin. The book manages to seamlessly cover more than 50 years of American filmmaking and it's wonderful to have the thoughts of multiple generations of directors, editors, and cinematographers compiled in one volume.  Whether you're a fan of documentaries, an aspiring documentary filmmaker, or unfamiliar with the entire field and would like to learn more, "The Art of the Documentary" is the book for you.   
 A fast and thrilling read! It kept me hooked well past my bedtime. I can't wait to read the  sequel 
 BARCHESTER TOWERS is the second Chronicle of Barset by Anthony Trollope, and continues the ideological wars of the fictitious cathedral community presented in THE WARDEN. It is a much more complex novel than THE WARDEN, and I don't feel that it is necessary to read THE WARDEN before reading BARCHESTER TOWERS, though THE WARDEN is a very enjoyable book.   The Bishop of Barchester, Dr. Grantly, Sr., has passed away, and Dr. Grantly, Jr., archdeacon of the Cathedral and son-in-law to Mr. Septimus Harding, protagonist of THE WARDEN, is vying for his fathers position. Unfortunately for Dr. Grantly, a new, leberal government has come into power days before his father's passing, and Dr. Proudie, well-known in London, who lacks any specific theological views, has been named to the post. He brings with him two characters who will drive much of the plot of the novel - his wife, Mrs. Proudie, and her favorite minister, Mr. Obadiah Slope.   Mrs. Proudie and her minister lack any theological ideas themselves, save one. The Sabbath is a holy day, and come-hell-or-high-water, they will have every man and woman in church, and every child in catechism, and more importantly, the mail trains will be stopped. The Proudies and Dr. Slope harbour Low-Church sympathies, meaning most important to the story, a distaste for ritual, while Dr. Grantly and his colleagues at Barchester harbor High-Church, though still anti-papist, sympathies. Needless to say, the two parties don't get along. The rest of the novel comprises several misunderstandings and underhandings and a comedic love-triangle (or square?). This is the second novel of Trollope's that I have read, and I found it engaging and very funny. Highly recommended. 
 The Canon EF 75-300mm is a Excellent product, I own the expensive USM version and this lense doesn't have nothing to be jealous about it, it's speed to focus is excellent,the main reason i bougth it is for my wildlife photography while kayaking, I wouln't take the USM version on my kayak, to expensive to get it wet, they both perform excellent, but the cheap price of this lense make it affordable and risk proof for your pocket, it's a little noisy but nothing that will affect it's use, plus it is a intimidating peace of equipment, that will make any person think you are a professional photographe 
 ...I bought this book for my 7-year-old twins, who arehome-schooled.  The book's reading level is appropriate for end offirst grade or beginning of second grade.  They LOVED this book!Their favorite story was the Worm story, which STILL sends them intoconvulsions of laughter whenever they hear it.  The book has also beenthe basis of discussion about intolerance, moving on the the face ofloss, appeasing others to make them feel good, and other topics.  Allin all, the book was absolutely worth the price 
 This book is about the last one written on the subject of graphics file formats, because this information can be found on the web and also because the number of image file formats and details necessary to write a meaningful book would result in a tome of mammoth size. The author of this little book did things right - he just picked five graphics file formats and covered them well. Chapter one is just a quick introduction to various aspects of graphics file formats and an introduction to terminology so you will understand why compressed image file formats work the way that they do in general.   Next the book gets into the file formats themselves by starting with one of the simplest file format to code and decode, Windows BMP. The next file format covered is the very simplest in the book - XBM. This file is also almost always used in the Windows environment. The next eight chapters and 135 pages are dedicated to explaining the JPEG format. Even the author admits that you will need to resort to outside references if you want to fully implement and understand the standard, but he gets you 90% of the way there. He restricts himself to explaining only sequential and progressive JPEG with Huffman coding and 8-bit samples. The author also does a great job of explaining the DCT, which is the basis of the JPEG format. If you haven't been able to find a good explanation of the DCT, try this book. The next chapter in the book is on GIF, and the author explains not only how to decode and encode the format, he also discusses the legal problems that have pretty much put an end to commercial GIF encoder/decoder development. The last three chapters are dedicated to the PNG file format and how to encode and decode them. Each chapter ends with a conclusion that tells you what you should have gotten out of that particular chapter and pseudocode is presented for each algorithm explained. The author expects that you already know how to program and that detailed implementation in a high level language is something you can handle. However, the author has thoughtfully included a CD with C++ source code implementing the vast majority of the algorithms described in the book. Thus if you buy a used copy make sure you get one with the CD, or you are missing much of the value of the book. 
 Finally, a diet that actually works and is easier to stick to than Atkins or South Beach. With easy to follow instructions, delicious recipes and ingredients it's easy to stick with it! I've lost 20 pounds already.  
 This book was very helpful.  I found that this book is more detailed than the 900 page, $160 textbook I bought for the class 
 All That Remains was a hard book to put down. Patricia Cornwell writes so well that it's difficult to find a place to take a break when reading her novels. She is an expert at striking a balance between detail and the flow of the story. As a reader (and a writer), I believe I can learn much from her. The fact that she was a crime reporter for some years and a medical examiner, as well, adds authenticity to her stories. I'm looking forward to her next book, Predator, due out on October 25, 2005.  When the daughter of powerful Washington politician, National Drug Policy Director, Pat Harvey, and boyfriend turn up missing, the services of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Richmond, New Jersey, are called upon once again. Four other couples have disappeared in similar fashion and have eventually been found murdered, all within a fifty-five mile radius of Williamsburg (Virginia). Scarpetta is called to a local rest area where Ms. Harvey's daughter, Deborah's, jeep has been found. When last seen, the couple was headed to the Harvey beach home in said jeep. A new investigation begins. Investigators, powerful politicians, and covert operations agents speculate as to whether or not this case is associated with Harvey's job or is it, perhaps, the fifth in a series of couple murders. As is often the case in Cornwell's stories, it becomes a question of who knows what and what is the real truth behind events and motives.  The murders have been particularly gruesome, and when found, all that remains of the young people are some bones and clothing, along with a jack of hearts playing card. Also, in each case, the victims' shoes and socks cannot be found. Scarpetta and Richmond homicide detective, Pete Marino, follow various leads, spend considerable time speculating on the who and why of the murders, while investigative reporter, Abby Turnbull, seems to be terrified about something (Marino doesn't trust her). Ex-lover, Mark James, makes an appearance and temporarily heats up the personal side of Scarpetta's life again. In the end the killer is found and the murders solved, but at tremendous cost to the Harvey family and to others. An excellent read.   Carolyn Rowe Hill 
 I love this book.  My 3rd grade teacher read it to my class.  Everyone loved it.  You must read it 
 This is a movie classic. The theme is so universal. There is no preaching in this movie but the massage is clear. People are basically the same- no matter what color, race or nationality they belong. The DVD print is OK. The story is a tear jerker.  M.Rahma 
 When I found out about Beer School and its topic I knew that I had to read it. First off, I'm a homebrewer and beer geek and I've seen a number of my friends leave successful, conventional careers to take a gamble with their dreams working with beer. Secondly, I'm an entrepreneur who started a business 15 years ago (not in the beer business), which, thankfully, turned out to be successful. And thirdly, I live in New York City and I'm a big fan of all things Brooklyn, especially the Brooklyn Brewery!  Beer School is a fast read, thanks to plenty of intriguing, amusing anecdotes that explain how this start up went from a simple idea to a major success, with the all-important countless pains, trials and tribulations in between.  I honestly didn't expect to learn anything new from the book, since I had already started a business. And I've followed the progess of and have been a supporter of Brooklyn Brewery since I moved to NYC in the early 90s. I was wrong. Not only did I pick up a lot of interesting business lessons, I sharpened my historical knowledge of the Brewery, which was, to my surprise, full of gaps.  I find that life experience is the best teacher. Beer School is one of the essential text books for a degree in entrepreneurship from the university of life, as it draws on the real life successes, failures and mixed results of two regular guys who had a dream to build a great brewery.  You don't need to be starting a business to get something out of Beer School. It's a damn good read, for the sake of entertainment alone! The stories of their run in with the mob, their chutzpah in getting a hot shot designer to work with them, their admirable philosophy of worker equity - there are plenty of fun, funny and revealing stories throughout the book.  Certainly for those interested in starting a business or interested in the beer business at all, it's a must read. Oh, and their beer ain't half bad, either 
 I read this book years ago and just reread it while on vacation. I enjoyed it so much more than the first time, although I loved it then. It really is a true crime classic, and as an avid TC reader, this one has my vote for all time favorite, right behind "In Cold Blood," and "Blood and Money." If you've read it before, read it again. This one stands the test of time 
 Phelps skillful conflation of an international history, philosophy, law, and literature persuasively argues that truth commissions contribute to personal and public healing and resist the cycle of retributive vengeance. Shattered Voices should be read by all who fear the consequences of existing hostilities in Bosnia, Iraq, and Sudan as well as those who consider language and storytelling as markers of civilization and essential to justice 
 An excellently well-considered anthology.  This listener went entirely Tull-less for a bit more than a decade, and I am only now revisiting music which once I knew very well.  In light of my own somewhat nuanced approach to Tull, I almost feel as though Ian Anderson compiled this personally for me (for the record, no, he never thought to consult me).  In brief, some of my favorite things about this disc:  1.  First, I admit that they lost me around the time of Stormwatch;  so the fact that far the greater part of this disc is from Heavy Horses and earlier, was a crucial consideration in springing for the disc.  I have my doubts about "Broadsword" and "Root to Branches" (though they are certainly, regretfully to use a lukewarm adjective, listenable);  but "Steel Monkey" was a pleasant musical surprise.  Even accounting for the for-me two dubious tracks, this is better than an hour of fine Tullery.  2.  I was a big fan of Living in the Past in its double-LP form;  was a little annoyed at the omission of "Bourée" from the CD reissue (notwithstanding very practical space limitations).  Anyway, overall very pleased with the five songs on this disc which represent Living in the Past - they are certainly the very best of that fine album.  3.  Similarly, very pleased with the `harvest' from the albums Aqualung and Songs from the Wood.  4.  I vaguely remember the entire Thick As a Brick album, but am probably content with the three-minute opening.  5.  The edited-down versions of "Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll:  Too Young to Die" and "Heavy Horses" are fine by me.  6.  With the edited-down version of "Minstrel in the Gallery," I take greater exception, but since in my view, you want to supplement this Very Best Of disc with the Minstrel in the Gallery album in its entirety anyway, I blithely withdraw the objection.  7.  Similarly, I am pleased that there is no excerpt (or "edit") from A Passion Play included, since this is really an album which you either want nothing to do with, or want to hear gloriously complete.  So, even counting "Broadsword," "Root to Branches" and the bleeding chunk of "Minstrel in the Gallery" as duds (which I don't quite, really), this disc is still 64 minutes of crème-de-la-crème Tull.  Supplement this disc with the remastered CDs of A Passion Play, Minstrel in the Gallery and Benefit, and you've got practically pure value for your music dollar in my view 
 This book offers a new platform for people who care about the future of the developing world. Ken Eldred spells out why business is the solution for many of the developing world's ailments. Not just business, but Godly and truly Christian business, which will help transform those cultural attitudes and values that represent both barriers to economic growth and chains to poverty.  Time-proven concepts like honesty, integrity, and fair dealings are vital to business success in a free market economy. There are cultures and attitudes-both in the developing world and in the West-that are real hindrances to economic success. The author makes the case for those business people with deeply-held values and "renewed minds" taking the initiative in changing those cultural beliefs-at the individual, company, and industry level. Eldred presents examples where Christian business people inspired by their personal faith are doing just that, even in some of the most underdeveloped parts of the world. He also reviews the history of business people pursuing spiritual and economic transformation around the globe.  I am a venture capitalist who's always looking for ways business can help change lives. Yes, as the author presents quite convincingly, business itself has redeeming value when it deals honestly and provides useful goods and services for one's fellow man. However, the concept of "Kingdom business" presented in this book goes a step further by considering the spiritual transformation that business people with a personal faith can promote. Eldred describes three different "Kingdom business" approaches ranging from developing microenterprises to establishing larger ventures, each most suitable for a different stage in an economy's development. After traveling and working with ministers and business people in more than 50 countries, I believe this book is a Godsend for those trying to make a difference. Very compelling and inspiring! 
 This book is great.  You feel like you are there with him while he does all that happens in this book.  I don't want to say to much and give away the plot but this book had me hooked from page one 
 Hello, Barnabas here. Thie Dark Shadows video cellection is an excellent  video collection, it's worth your time and worth your money. Take it from  me, I know this first hand. Good day / night, pleasent nightmares 
 ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING is a solid pep talk.  Keith Harrell gives great advice in an enthusiastic manner.  The book is rich with examples from the authors personal experience and those of his friends and associates.  It certainly does the trick in inspiring the reader, however the material is primarily a rehash of material found in other books.  If it is a new or novel approach to life changing steps that you're looking for you won't find it here, however if you are looking for a nice spark to jump start your personal goals then ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING is a solid success. 
 A must read for anyone who has even heard of the Iraq wars.   This booklet is surprisingly dense in detail and provocation of thought. Mr. Hitch is brilliant in his use of language and fact. None can deny that he is on solid ground.   Yet, the writing is unimposing and asks the reader to look kindly, and with passion, upon the suffering of those liberated-no matter what the cost. Read the book and you will see beyond the politics of the war.   PenetratingArmenian  A Self Certified Blogspot Blogge 
 I received a copy of this book from my son's occupational therapist.  I was ready to know more about my son's condition and to know why he would do somethings instead of others.  I wanted to know how the milestones varied from "healthy" children.  I felt this book covered everything that I wanted to know and even discussed what to do when writing a will and how it changes with a Down Syndrome child.  Things I never would have thought would be different until reading this book.  It took about 4 months before I was willing to read something about this because I wanted to start raising him just like I raised my other children.  This was definitly a book that did not go the extreme in the condition which is something I wanted.  I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who has a child with Down Syndrome 
 WOW!!! The pictures of the roses in this book are unmatched by any other publication. I have for many years been a Hybrid Tea Rose fan, but after reading this book and after visiting several gardens with Austin's roses in them, I have been converted. I just ordered over 20 bushes and I cannot wait for their arrival next spring. I agree with a previous reviewer who commented that the writing is self serving at times, but Austin's passion for his plants can be understood. Austin's comments about group plantings and his recommendations concerning minimiums for plantings of each species, I found invaluable. I believe this book is well worth the price and will win you over to a relatively new breed of rose 
 That's what I call a great comic book collection! It just covers the earlier adventures of the Amazing Spider-man (#1-10 plus Amazing Fantasy #15) and the episodes'arts and scripts may not be as entertaining as some on the further issuses but still this collection remains a classic of its genre and is functional to the full understanding of the super-hero character Spider-Man.

 Liked this concept! and writer! No play on words to stab, but a builder 
 David and Tom Gardner walk the reader through retirement planning in their usual good-natured style. Everything is covered here for us age-phobic boomers, such as investments, insurance, housing, social security, health care, educating our kids and taking care of our aging parents. I particularly liked their suggestions about the need to downsize our oversized houses and to sell off our excess possessions on eBay (presumably to unsuspecting members of Generations X and Y). A well-written and sensible book. Now all I need is enough common sense to follow their advice 
 I'am surprise to be the first one to rewiew this excellent CD. It's a Costes series but with a different name, but the music are always the same : good music!.Messieur Pompougnac here again make well his business. 14 traks without one to skip. De-Phazz, Charles Schillings, and many others (who are Toka Projec? with a very funny and nice version of Fallen Angels?).If you already bought Costes 1,2,3,4,5, dont'miss this CD, 67 minuts of high class d.j. club/music 
 Ginghamsburg Church and Len Wilson are THE experts on using high-tech media in the church. Learn from the best.

Also included is information on equipment that you can buy to start your media ministry 
 Rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence, teenage angst, sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from Alexander Payne.  Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range.  Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality.  In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.  One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election.  Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she "can carry out his divine plan."  Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win.   ELECTION is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind.  Enjoy 
 Though I don't write by profession, as much as I think I would like to, I do dabble in it on the side.  So when I recently found myself despondent and unable to persevere even in a writing as a sometime hobby (due to some unseen blocking force), I happened to pick up this book.  A while later, I was able to resume my writing, and I think that this book set me at ease again.  
 This is the story of four Red Sox teammates whose friendship lasted over 50 years.  You'll also gain great insight into the four players' lives 
 Don't let the size fool you.  If you have been diagnosed with DID, then this little book of 109 pages is what you need.  It doesn't go into the hows and whys of DID, the DID Source Book is great for that.  What "Got Parts?" gives you is a day to day manual for getting through life with DID.  I carry it in my backpack where ever I go. There are times that DID just gets me down, so I pick up the book, thumb easily to the section I want, take a minute to read about what I need to do, then I remember and do it.  Another great thing about this book is that it is written by someone who has DID, who lives and fights in the trenches of DID.  This brings authenticity to the book.  It also has an index and is easy to locate the subject you are looking for. The writing style of the author is very easy going and she doesn't ever break into stories of her past.  There is a page, however in the very back entitled, "About the Author" who remains unidentified.  Even then she never talks about the details of her abuse.  It's just plain good advice from someone who knows.  I have several DID books, but this one is my favorite when I just need to get through the day.  When I have moments of feeling crazy, I open the book.  When I feel overwhelmed with emotion, I open this book.  It helps me to clear my thinking and gives me immediate direction.  In short, I really love this book.    
 I picked up the book and didnt put it down. I read it when I ate, walked, before going to bed and I would have read it while working if I could have. I read it non stop till I finished it. And even that didnt prevent me from going back to intriguing passages to read it again. This is a hyrbid work between a science fiction and fantasy. Actually contains the best of both. Being very familiar with the Hindu pantheon, it was astonishing that he did what he did with it, and even more inspiring for he brought out the best and the worst of it and still left you without a bias or a new thing to worship. I would highly recommend it for anyone with a taste for a juxtapositioning of concepts 
 This book is for anyone who wants to consider reasons why they love what they love.  The author's independent view gives the type of different perspective many of us read books for.  If she was only super smart, & told us primarily things we already knew, that would probably not be worth reading.  Ms. Knapp is so much more.  I admire Ms. Knapp's intellect, uncommon perspective, & incredible focus on a particular subject matter.  Anyone who reads this book is going to understand more about why certain people go to such amazing lengths, and spend so much time, money, and energy on their dogs.  Her writing style is great.  Her lack of repitition in her vocabulary, sentence structure, and thought presentation is remarkable.  This book is not just about dogs.  It is an interesting read for people who want to understand the thought processes of people who:  1) love dogs, or 2) are neurotic, or 3) have human relationship commitment issues, or 4) struggle with their human family.     Ms. Knapp's focus & examination of the ideas and perceptions that can lead to the creation of strong bonds with dogs is fascinating.  She gives the reader a greater appreciation, like a wine expert might teach someone more to appreciate about wine.  Ms. Knapp loved dogs for their tolerance, faithfulness, lack of artificial baggage, and accepting accomodation.  She found qualities in her dog that she did not perceive in the humans she encountered.  She asserts that relationships with dogs are occasionally a substitute for other things; but more often, they are beautiful on their own merits and do not find value by being a substitute for something else.   Dogs can't use words.  They are beautiful because they must learn to listen and communicate to the people around them largely based on non-verbal cues.  Very sadly, Ms. Knapp died at too young of an age.  If she were alive, I'd write her a letter of gratitude and ask her many questions 
 I can't remember that last time we laughed so hard. Full of adult humor, this is one DVD set to get! 
 Warren Beatty raps out the best work of his career both in front of the camera as Senator Jay Bulworth, and behind it as the film's director.  Bulworth is hilarious, politically incorrect, and tells truths that come in the form of shocking interviews, and also in the form of a manic white-rapper phase that delivers his message.  Halle Berry is at her hottest, most mysterious and intriguing, the streetwise kids in the ghetto almost steal the show, and a jumping soundtrack pops the movie right off the screen.  There are a few movies that display so much insider acumen, "Wag the Dog," "Primary Colors,"  and "Thank You For Smoking" come immediately to mind.  Bulworth is in an elite satirical league that could include "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," but to be more accurate it is in a tradition dating back several centuries that includes greats like Swift, Voltaire, Shaw, and even George Orwell.   
 This is such a great story. One of my favorite Nora novels.  Adrianne was a fanstastic character. Strong, independant, over came so much in her life. Phillip was sexy, romantic, and flawed. The perfect romance hero in my opinion. It's their little flaws that make them come alive to me.  This story starts off with a bit of foreshadowing, which i don't normally like but it was amazingly done in this story.  A family of magicians and thieves. Nora did her research on both subjects and it shows in this story. She doesn't go over the top and bore you with tedious details of thieving and magic, but just enough so you feel the story.  I won't get into details, it would be a shame to have this story ruined for you ;) A must read. And even good for a reread. 
 Almost the same band as the one on Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch - but led by the pensive, individualistic pianist and composer Andrew Hill, and coloured lavishly by the imagination of the great tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson. There are elements of the same atonal experimentation and rhythmic splintering of Out to Lunch But I think it's an even better, more accomplished album. There's a witty tribute to Monk called "New Monastery" 
 I have to state that I am the Fiachra mentioned in the front inset of the book.  i learnt more about my family reading this book than i ever imagined possible.  For those who are interested to know Mr. Sheridans 2nd book in  just finished and will emotionally move any man or woman as hard as a rock  to tears.  Like the previous reviewer i had never cried until i read this  book.  The next book deals with a more adult view on the trials and  tribulations of life and the complex issues of love.  If you haven't  already read 44, do so b4 no.2 hits the shelves 
 The ideas in this book are not new, but they are powerful.  Put to practice (which is the hard part), they can truly transform a family.  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone 
 This magnificent novel, set among the poorest of the Chinese pesants, engulfs the reader with its warmth and its characters.  Ms. Buck's knowledge of the Chinese life is fully demnostrated, and the language, with its quaint turns, adds such life to the story.  Ms. Buck told The Good Earth in an almost plainsong style, letting the power of the events and people unfold naturally.  This book has won about a zillion awards, and deserves them all.  Reading it is a unique experience; do not deny yourself the pleasure.  You will love it 
 Anne Morrow Lindbergh was as introspective a woman as I have come across in my reading. She addresses in this book, among other things, simplifying one's life, the importance of alone time, and how relationships metamorphose over time, all in her thoughtful, elegant style 
 This is a good study Bible.  King James is the only way to go - the only true word of God.  This has good references 
 This skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a "Santa" gift...the hit of the day!  Although she hasn't had much opportunity to use them yet, she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine.  They are nice looking and fit is true to size 
 Dave's book gives a straightforward common sense approach to finances. Its not a "Get rich quick" scheme but a new way to live your financial life. It does work, the book is a must for everyone. Give it to your older children (teens) and relatives and friends who might be struggling with debt 
 I use the activities in this book every day with my special education students.  They are having fun and it is helping them with their motor skills and their academic skills.  I would recommend it to any teacher. 
 I reviewed the German twin to this book and as in that one, this is just a limited sampler of a few, and probably more representative U.S. Tanks in WWII.  This book though is more technically specific and less scattered as its German counterpart. The colored photographs are very accurate and the angles taken are documenting very well how these Shermans, Stuarts, Pershings and Hellcats, as well as some half-tracks looked in their glory days.  This is why I gave it a 5 easy stars. It is not so much for the color factor. Almost all vehicles are in dull Olive Drab or Olive Green, so do not expect some fancy camo here, like in the German twin. Rather expect to understand how many variants there were of just one vehicle and the history of its progression throughout WWII.  You actually get pictures of for instance, an M3A1 back to back with its later cousin, the M5A1. You get the progression of the M2A1 half-track into the M3A2 and its variants, like the M16 (all well documented, with accurate reconstructions of these vehicles and their photos).  In this, the book is totally different in scope from its German counterpart. While the German one documented the variants of German AFVs, from light to heavy and their various employments on the front, the present one deals more in the fast development of U.S. tanks in response to the German pressure put upon the American industry to respond to a very serious threat, which the German tanks represented.  There are some of the most beautiful pictures ever taken of the M18 Hellcat and M26/T26 Pershing, but also highly detailed interior photos of the M3A1 scout car and Half-Tracks used by the Infantry.  This, together with its "German" counterpart, added to Jean Restayn's highly informative drawings contained in "Tanks of World War Two", should enlighten anybody interested in modeling accurate replicas or just study in detail these "beasts of war".  Highly recommended 
 Exactly what I wanted and delivered in a timely manner.  Good book 
 The leader singer of this band (Maynard James Keenan) focuses a lot more on his singing on his APC albums than in his TOOL albums. He has a wonderful voice, and I like the fact that he expresses his vocal talents more on this album. I like also that the songs are not too long and there are no long spaces of silence, such as on the TOOL albums. Although TOOL has its merits. They seem to focus more on instrumentals but they are incorporating some aspects of APC. It's a good cd to listen to if you want to listen to rock but not too hard of stuff 
 The announcement of a new book by Nicholas Basbanes is an occasion of joy for any devoted reader who loves reading about books. My copies of Basbanes' works are the backbone of my collection of books about books, and it is he who introduced me to the dazzling world of the "gently mad."  Since reading A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books, I eagerly await each installment to discover what secret corridors and closed doors he will open next. Basbanes' works act as a secret handshake that allows entry to a world any serious bibliophile longs to enter, a world devoted to the care, handling and love of the printed word.  In Every Books Its Reader, the social history of the book is explored from the perspective of the reader. Basbanes explores the meaning readers give to texts through their personal experiences, and how that experience helps connect with others. He says, "We are not only the product of what we read, we are in association with others who have read the same things."  Early I discovered 84 Charing Cross Road, a book that became a dear friend to be revisited often. Helene Hanff showed what a love of reading can truly bring to a life, the journey one can take through books with a helpful guide. Nicholas Basbanes easily fills this role. His pages resonate with quotes and stories and his love of books fairly bursts off the page. He carries the reader to a new path that leads to books, "a book casually encountered by an imaginative mind, lighting a spark that ignites a flame of creativity...."   At the start of Every Books Its Reader, Basbanes shares a story that ends "...if ever I go to Heaven I know where to find her. I shall go straight over to the corner by the bookcases." When I get there, I shall expect to find Nicholas Basbanes there, holding court.  Armchair Interviews says: IF you LOVE books, you will love this one.      
 One of my favourite CDs .... do yourself a favour and buy it -- you won't regret it 
 Yes, you can come home. When Patty Duke belts out her first song you just know this is going to be gawd awful good. Her twitchy body, coupled with an out-of-key voice is a hoot. And not to give anything away for the newbies but you will be on the floor when she sings in the sanitarium. This is a beautiful looking movie. The colors shine. The sound is terrific. John Williams gets the only Academy Award for original score. What no Dion Warwick for Theme from Valley of the Dolls? I was surprised there was no nomination. The trivia track, yes there is a track filled with trivia, mentions an issue of the song released for radio(a different version) and the one played on movie. Maybe an issue here? There is a commentary track by Barbara Parkins but I was disappointed that there was only one voice from the movie. It would have been better if there could have been a couple more. There are many extras, many of which I haven't seen yet. A nice package of extras. This had to be a career destroying movie. Only Lee Grant and John Williams seemed to come out unscathed. And Susan Hayward? What was she thinking? As the star among stars she actually looks like the only actor in the movie, but her laughable stage and singing performance scenes along with the obligatory female cat fight with the Patty Duke character keeps this movie rolling in schlock. This movie is filled with past and future Academy Award winners, Grant, Duke, Hayward, Williams, and Martin Milner(just kidding). And watch for an appearance by Richard Dreyfus, no less, towards the end of the movie. This is a 5 star movie for the genre. Dreamy scenery, bad dialog and soundtracks, outstanding cast doing their best to make this awful, a decent title track song by Warwick, sex, and have I mentioned, drugs. Enjoy.  
 There are few sources such as this one - EXHIBITION DESIGN - that share insider thoughts and plans and results of the process of presenting exhibitions in museums.  As such it is a welcome addition to the art lover's library, something to ponder when trying to discover why some exhibitions (despite the subject of the curated objects) make and impact while others feel cold and distant to all but the addicted lover of that particular subject.  Architect and exhibition designer David Dernie shares the mechanics and philosophies of current museums, pointing out the  current concepts of 'immersion, interaction, and multisensory experiential approach' have moved from the purely entertainment field into the realm of the once rather sterile filed of exhibition design.  His thoughts are amply illustrated by architectural renderings and photographs that, while informative, are not of the quality one would expect from a book on museum wisdom!  But the elements of psychological significance on how to present art to the public eye to enhance the experience of viewing are sound ones, and in his words 'how objects are arranged will determine the nature of the message they communicate.'

 Out of all the events (and non-events) in this book, the moment that most stood out in my mind is the private palaver between Roland and Jake.  The main purpose of Wolves of the Calla in the Dark Tower series is, I think, to tell the tale of Jake's initiation into the Gunslinger order.  Up until this point, Jake has been a `prentice, though prepared in the physical requirement, not yet ready to bear responsibilities for strategic decisions.  But here in Calla Bryn Sturgis, he finally makes his challenge to his teacher.  Jake's questioning of Roland's decision not to tell Susannah of Mia's presence marks what is certainly a less violent coming of age than Roland's own challenge to Cort with his hawk, but a challenge nonetheless.  When Roland admits to Jake, "I don't know what to do.  Would you like to tell me?" he concedes that Jake has earned a say in the decisions of the ka-tet.  Jake is so taken aback with this concession that he thinks Roland is being sarcastic, but after discussion, the two come to a compromise concerning Mia.  Jake at first has trouble accepting that the ka-tet will follow his decision for good or ill, and accuses Roland of passing the buck, but Roland (Ah, gods love him - could King have written this part at eighteen?  I think not.) bids him put aside childish indecision once and for all to claim his rightful place.  Out of all the moments in all 900 pages, this is the moment that got me most.    Other highlights: The weapons and appearance of the enemy have surprising origins. Roland gets laid by a worthy woman. Susannah learns a new weapon and rocks it.  (Yeah, girl!) Eddie meets up with his old drug-dealing pals and owns them once again. Jake becomes the man.  Lowlights, however: Vampires?  Really? Susannah's demon spawn? An entire town full of new characters? Andy = Jar-Jar?  Wolves was a great book, albeit too long, and probably largely unnecessary.  Not a waste of time, though.  I was thoroughly entertained, as always 
 Great book for Toddlers  The best part of this book is that it doesn't tell you what is and isn't appropriate behavior. Values and customs are set by families as well as by the society we live. The book explains a method that is simply the process to teach those values. The book doesn't tell you what you should or shouldn't be allowing your child to do. Instead, it addresses how to get the message across in a calm and efficient manner, while being direct and respecting the child.   I did not grow up in the type of learning environment explained in this book so I was floored and a little skeptical it could work. But within a month of following the methods I could see a big difference in the relationship I had with my son. I had slipped into spanking and instead of learning my son was being defiant. This book gave us room to allow him to learn proper behavior without feeling threatened.   I do want to note that I am still a proponent of spanking done in the right manner and only at particular times, however this book is adamantly against spanking and doesn't do a very good job at explaining why. Simply saying that children of parents who spanked will always be violent is silly and is disproven thousands of times by all of us who were raised in a generation of spanking and we are not out violently assaulting others.   GREAT BOOK! A must read for EVERY parent.   Note - it is important to follow the ENTIRE plan. Doing so provides the most respect for the process. Doing almost everything but still yelling at the child isn't going to prove useful.   
 Excellent book!  Buy this book if you are new to the Pocket PC!!! I tried another and it just did'nt have the detail.  McPherson writes like he is sitting next to you!  It is easy to read and I've become educated in how to use my ipaq more efficently.  McPherson also has many useful websites within the book that are very helpful 
 Fun book to listen to when you want company while doing mundane chores around the farm!  Kept me enticed along the way 
 "Lady Moses" is an evolving tale of the coming of age of Jacinta Louise Buttercup Moses. This novel exposes the struggles of this young woman who, as a child, was circumferenced with love and fantasy. As her life begins to unravel, so does the novel's diverging story line. The strong admiration for her father was felt as one unexpected incident led to another, leaving little Jacinta alone and unadaptable to the home life around her. Jacinta grows from youth to adult with a host of complexities that lead to many imperfections in her life, Lady Moses, for one. This leaves Jacinta no choice but to come to terms with reality and take life for what it is; 'not perfect'. Lucinda Roy does a great job in depicting symbolic expressions to move the tone of the story. Such a seemingly outrageous happening near the end was needed to reiterate the theme of the book that "all it not always as it seems." This story, with its complex characters and their complex life circumstances will challenge readers to open their minds to all of life's possibilities, including the reasonably impossible 
 I really wasn't sure about this book just based on the cover. Boy was glad I changed my mind and purchased it! Like another reviewer I've read several books on the subject of perimenopause. None can compare to COULD IT BE...PERIMENOPAUSE? Dr. Goldstein has provided such a great service to those of us who are wondering what the heck is going on with our bodies and minds during this sometimes trying time. One of the sections that I was so glad to read is about dealing with symptons in a natural way. He asks, "Do you really want it natural or safe?" Dr. Goldstein brings up great points in answering this question. I realized what I wanted was safe and if at all possible natural. If anyone is contemplating surgery, get a copy of this book and read the section about this subject. It is very important and a REAL eye opener. I wish I had this book before I had surgery. This book really educates you and prepares you to ask more questions when visiting your OB/GYN 
 As a student of NT Greek I have found this volume indispensible. You have frequency, word groups and such like. Plus it has every word used in the Greek NT from Greek to Aramaic to Latin. Buy it 
 I concur with other reviewers who praise this book for its organization, clarity, and insight.  It departs from the usual chronological order followed by most biographies to concentrate on the development of Lincoln's character, party connections, and administrative abilities.  At different times Lincoln is described as "shrewd," "cunning," "inefficient," "firm," "diligent," "energetic," and hard-working.  I also concur with Christian Schlect's review that Professor Carwardine's conclusion seeme to conflict with his text.  Carwardine sums up:  "Lincoln is best understood not as the extraordinary figure of the iconographers, but as a man of his times, politically wise but capable of misjudgments, too, and powerful largely because he was representative" (p. 319), as if only iconographers could consider Lincoln extraordinary.  One need only look at President Buchanan before Lincoln and President Johnson after him to see that the times also called up some very mediocre figures.  Carwardine's conclusion comes as a surprise, but the surprise is softened by an afterword that explains his desire to convey a "neutral" view.   His book is praised by many of the best Lincoln scholars alive, and they are right:  with the exception of his page about exceptionality, his book is exceptionally good 
 the first chapter, being the introduction introduces the centrality of the Prophet to the three faiths, accompanied with an appendice that is a treatment of the sources at hand. In a way, this work is a quest for the "historical" prophet, as he is found in the Judeo-Christian literature (silent between the periods of his life between Ur and Mecca) and the Islamic literature (silent on the period of his life in Palestine).   that is not to say, that there is no over-lap: there is, and there are avenues of complementarities, and other avenues where they contradict each other, fundamentally. these contradictions surround the subject of separation of Hagar and Ismail from Ibrahim, the age, the manner of separation and the final destination of mother and son  having accepted this, the author embraces these varied notions, and posits, that one has to be willing to examine all claims, give each tradition serious consideration, and attempt to synthesize across traditions where possible. importantly, when none of the above are possible, one ought to resort to an honest and intellectual examination of each traditions narrative, motivated by the genuine need to integrate the three-monotheistic faiths, where-ever theo-logically it is possible.  while the Bible and the Quran are in dis-agreement concerning dogma and theology, this should not obscure the fact the "historically"  speaking, the two sources complement each other: filling in where the other missed.  how is this possible then, to even attempt a synthesis of narrative? while Jews and Christians while considering the Quran as a source, don't have to regard it as a "sacred scripture", one still has to  deal with the historicity and it's acceptability in the 7th Century CE  it is important to garner the consequences of the author placing this within the context of the 7th Century Christian Era: since he places it within the context of arab tradition being independent, while other sources did exist i.e. Jewish "Midrashic"), and this is where he proceeds to date the Quran and the non-Quranic sources within the appendix (i.e. Appendix I)  having addressed the objection from the Christian and the Jewish, he turns his attention to the muslim belief premised on the notion of "contamination", which he terms a "myopic" view, since  historically speaking scholars and historians are always working with documents that are distorted, altered and/or contaminated. the scholar/bio-grapher combs through such information looking for "grains or kernels of truth".   let it be know, that the synthesis here is that of "narrative" and  not that of "dogma".  words on methodology are in place, delineating "the context", as it relates to the persona of the prophet. the author is conscious of the great man syndrome, which derive in essence from several factors  (a) socio-economic considerations  (b) geo-political factors  (c) climatic constraints  (d) and in my own view, the prevailing intellectual, philosophical, religious beliefs and practices.  the inherent problem within the great man syndrome is that it pushes the prophet "out of the realm of historical reality" and places it squarely within the "world of legend", accomplished through miracle stories and the passage of time, which then lends it an aura of every day occurrence, rendering miracles mundane and by suggesting a stamp of "Divine Authenticity" - leads it to further degeneration into the  world of myth and fairy tale.  these are aspects that need are contended with, as they relate to the incident of birth, infancy and the details of his escape from the fiery furnace. of-course, one is not denying all stories related to miraculous events, for it would tantamount to a denial of the Divine.  the authors approach is to proceed with a construction of the reality of the prophet, with sources, in this specific order,  a. Quran and the authentic traditions from Prophet Muhammad  b. Torah and other Jewish Scripture (s)  c. Non-canonical, pseudo-pigraphical writings in the Judeo-Christian literature  d. Writings in archaeology and Middle Eastern history  
 This is one of those rare fiction books that you want to believe every word of and make last forever. Author Steven Pressfield has given the world a delightful classic which thanks to the phenomenal movie, should have a very long shelf life. Admittedly, the book takes a while to gain momentum, but once it does it grabs hold of you and won't let go until the last page. People who love the game of golf will really love this book and the lessons it offers on golf as a metaphor for life. I don't give many books 5 stars, however, this book actually deserves even more! Additionally, it can be reread many times and new messages appear that were previously overlooked. A real gem 
 I really loved this book. It was recommended to me by my graduate thesis professor who is a leading edge researcher in prosthetics. I am also the mom of a disabled son AND I've worked with amputees during my graduate school years. This book speaks to the realities, doubts, and fears of being a disabled person, yet it's hopeful, too. Trudeau really captures the feelings and thoughts of both the amputee and family members. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is wrestling with amputation and/or disability issues and who wants a thoughtful (and sometimes lighthearted--there IS light in the darkness!) view on it. This book is realistic and human. Don't miss it 
 Many books were written about Jonh Ford. All of them tell the story and the profile of the man. But John Ford was more than that. His life is the beginning, but the book doesn?t take it as a experience or example for his films. The exploration is a long trip in this book. The readers are going to find the artist who control everything around and his mind to think faster than others. He made no more than one take, sometimes to have completely control about the film, not suffering the torture of the film process and the editing. It?s a strange story about the man who won four Academy Awards? for Best Directing but he never won an Oscar for one of his western films. The book explores how he created the images and how he felt involved in those stories so different from cowboys, horses and  shots: 'The grapes of Wrath', 'How green was my valley', 'The informer' and 'The quiet man'.  His camera was different in all these ones.  But finally you can see the horizon, the actor, the music and the ending.  It is a film directed by John Ford. Thanks to him, the movies were different in style. He had the conception of an artist.      
 Maugham, as always, writes in a very easy to read style, the characters are crafted imaginatively and sensitively, and the story is interesting and progresses like a biography. In fact, I was to find out later that the story of Charles Strickland, who leaves his wife and family to pursue his own artistic ambitions is inspired by the story of a French impressionist painter Paul Gauguin (famous for painting Tahiti women).   The novel is in a beautiful narrative, checkered by delightful moorings of the author, well-written dialogues and descriptions which are picturesque enough to be adapted by the reader into a sort of beautiful movie and documentary, which all human emotions coming into play. The novel is about passion, the intense passion that drives artists, helps them to achieve greatness at the cost of their own idiosyncracies, passion which drives as well as cuts, passion that propels a being beyond the commonplace. For admirers of Paul Gauguin, this novel represents a kind of biography, that presents a life-story in a very unobstrusive fashion, and sheds light into the elements in painter's mind and heart that must have influenced his art.   Beyond Charles Strickland and the narrator, there are several characters worth mention. Strickland's wife is a woman who admires artists and writers (and fails to see the artist in his own husband), Dirk Stroeve is a painter who knows his limitations as well as he has the talent of seeing the genious in others and he is a human being who is wronged by his own zeal to be helpful and caring, Mrs Stroeve is (without revealing anything) a very interesting character, and there are many others. The novel benefits from Maugham's skill as writer of short stories and plays, for the novel consists of many chapters, each chapter tells of an incident or dialogue, and the story moves through smoothly and nicely.  Another brilliant novel to read and like. If you liked Maugham's Razor's edge, this will endear Maugham further! 
 It is a tragedy that Brandon Lee died while making this film.  Had he lived, the Crow sequels would have been much better.  The Crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace.  It set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990's.  
 THIS IS A WELL RESEARCHED AND VERY SCHOLARLY BOOK. IVAN VAN SERTIMA AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS WORK HAVE PRODUCED MUCH INSIGHT ON AFRICAN WOMEN IN WORLD HITORY LIKE QUEEN NZINGA, THE CANDACE QUEENS, MAKEDA (QUEEN SHEBA, HATSHEPSUT AND MANY OTHERS. I FEEL THAT THIS WORK IS OF GREAT SIGNIFIGANCE AND SHOULD BE READ BY ALL WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE ROLE OF AFRICAN WOMEN IN WORLD HISTORY 
 Tokyo Story  The only other Ozu movie I have seen is The Story of Floating Weeds (the silent era one), and I didn't like it very much. I ended up blind-buying the Criterion Tokyo Story from my work because it had just been sold back used and with my employee discount it came to $15 (Le Cercle Rouge was also sold back, also $15). I didn't know if I'd like it but if I didn't I knew a LOT of people who would be willing to pay me the fifteen dollars I spent to get their hands on it, so it was all good.  However, that will be unnecessary. I ended up loving just about every minute of it. I don't know quite what was different about Ozu's style this time around as opposed to Story of Floating Weeds, but I think it has something to do with it being sound-era and not having all those intertitles disrupting everything. Story of Floating Weeds was rather dialog-heavy for a silent era film, and it seems that Ozu's particular style is pretty much dialog heavy anyway, so he just works better in the sound era. That said, half the time I forgot the dialog seconds after reading it but never felt like I needed it. Even though this movie is basically people sitting around talking for two hours and fifteen minutes (with a death put in for good effect), it was a very pleasant visual experience.  The whole low-angle static camera approach worked better than I ever thought possible, being a Western film student and all. I was sitting on the floor eating while I was watching it, and the angle with the television was spot on with the angles in the film, so I felt like I was either sitting around watching all of this unfold or was a little kid again watching it unfold. The best part was that I've already read all that stuff about Ozu and family, and he gets it spot on. I felt like I was at another one of my family's reunions, where everyone's happy to see each other and all but different levels of business and energy just eventually tire everyone out.  Also, Ozu's quiet, methodical approach to building a quiet, almost listless world is very peaceful and alluring. With only two shots in the entire film with a moving camera, everything felt wonderfully zen (though I wouldn't label Ozu a Buddhist. His importance of family motif is a bit too worldly for Buddhists). A definite "beingness" pronounced the film and helped it be more than just a slide show of a family reunion.  5 stars.  --PolarisDi 
 "Another Page" was Christopher Cross' second album was released in 1983.  The album was on the charts through 1984 and spawned three hits, all of which hit the top-40: "All Right" (#18 - 1983), "No Time For Talk" (#33 - 1983), "Think of Laura" (#9 - 1984).  Despite this, the album only went gold, a stark contrast from his 5-grammy debut album, released three years earlier.    Contained within this album are a number of phenomenal musicians:  Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Don Henley of the Eagles, Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers, not to mention Art Garfunkel, a duet with Karla Bonoff and three members from the group Toto:  Jeff Porcaro, Steve Lukather, and Mike Porcaro.  Michael Omartian, a kingpin in Contemporary Christian music, produced the album, as well as tinkling the ivories on a few numbers.    Of the hits, "Think of Laura" was made popular when the soap opera General Hospital used it when the character Laura died.  In all actuality, it was written in memory of a friend of Christopher Cross' who died in a car accident.    The other two hits were definitely backed up by Toto (though I cannot prove this), which is one of my favorite groups.  Toto did a lot of studio work prior to their debut in 1977.  Even after their success of "Toto IV" (they were the major grammy winners the following year - 1982), they continued to do studio work, most notably being the back-up band for Michael Jackson's chart-topping "Thriller" album.  If you're as familiar with their work as I am, Toto's style is impreccably recognizable - in fact, Steve Lukather is given credit for his guitar solo in "All Right."    I want to take some time to take about "No Time For Talk."  This tune is one of the most incredibly, creatively written of any pop tune that I've listened to.  The entire verse is built entirely on three notes.  The intro, which contains those three notes repeats itself with the '80's big synth sound and an expanded bass line.  When you listen to verse one, you probably won't catch the similarity.  Then there's verse two, which is entirely different as the musicians use substitute chords to add variety.  It all comes to a head in verse three when the synth returns and one realizes - "that was the intro" - how cool!  As if that's not enough, listen to the drums.  I'm 99% sure that it's Jeff Porcaro - it's just too good.  His playing sounds so simple, yet he's accenting at just the right places - it is purely amazing.  Did I mention the instrumental - very complex chord changes.  If anything, buy the album for this song.  You definitely won't be disappointed.  Of the ten tunes on the album, seven are ballads.  All of them have very memorable melodies and are beautifully orchestrated. Most notable are "Words of Wisdom," which has an amazing guitar solo done by the Cross himself, and "What Am I Supposed to Believe," a gorgeous duet with pop singer Karla Bonoff.   Most critics agree that "Another Page" contained some great material - so what went wrong?  It's hard to say.  Growing up in the 1980's, the big artists of 1983 were "Thriller" and Billy Joel's "An Innocent Man," both of which had six releases each.  His music's not quite as progressive as theirs was, yet it certainly is more interesting than some of the stuff that came out that year.  Could it have been MTV?  History shows that it separated Peter Cetera from Chicago - perhaps he didn't fit the "rock" image.  Another ballad artist that lost during this same time was Barry Manilow; yet, Elton John still retained his popularity well into the mid-1990's.    Who knows what went wrong.  History does prove that despite his 1985 and 1988 releases, he never made it back into the top-40.  If you've read this review and are thinking about purchasing some of his music, this album is worth the money spent.  You won't be disappointed 
 It was bought as a gift for someone.  They really enjoyed the book. 
 Jeezy's been recognized as a representative of real hip hop after his debut album. This album solidifies it.   You will only hear of maybe two tracks through MTV or radio - but honestly the whole album is dope. Jeezy's flow over sick beats is a match made in heaven - and shouldn't be confused with any kind of one-hit wonder or short lived rap.  having said that, my favorite tracks are;   "U Know What It Is" "Still On It" "I Luv It" "I Got Money" (featuring T.I.)  not many guest features on here - taking it back to the old school. T.I. and R. Kelly make appearances - and the copy I picked up at Best Buy has two exclusive tracks, featuring Three 6 Mafia.  This album has the feeling of a raw mixtape style release - not hyed much by any labels or promotion as far as I remember, I didn't know it was coming out until a week before it's release. The production is tight, and as he has consistently done; Jeezy delivers. Go buy this album 
 In studying the Bible, especial the horribly translated KJV, one needs help to understand what is really being said. I belive that the Strongs concordance is a wonderful helper when looking for hard to find verses, or when you seriously decide to study the bible, want to know and understand the language behind it. Hebrew is a language that cannot be fully translated into english because every word either  comes from another root word or is closly related to some other word. For example, the Divine name YHVH has been said to mean " Self existant one". The superficial definition of it in the strongs give it that meaning as well, but with a little determination one can use this book to discover that it doesnt mean that at all. Hava, or HVH in hebrew, means to breath and/or to become. YHVH then means He is causing breath. However, if you digg even deeper you will see that YHVH also has within it AVAH which means to desire, or wish for, showing Gods ability to simply desire a thing to be. So with all this we can see that YHVH means He who causes to breath, or He who causes to become through breathing, or even He who manifests his desires through breath. Of course, breath being a symbol of life and the actual meaning of Spirit, Ruach, Breath, and not some Phantasmic force, but Gods own voice is creating. Compare with Genesis Ch1:2 and Gods breath moved upon the face of the waters,3 And God said... The strongs concordance can help a person see the true picture instead of the horrible translation of 16th century so-called scholars 
 This book covers important type setting principles that are key in creating professional looking typography. Do you capitalize a.m. or p.m.? Where do you put a comma when there are quotations? How do you handle fractions - and more. Highly recommend as a staple for any design studio 
 This biography/autobiography was a fascinating look at the issues of race and identity as they played out in the life of one family.  I was a little disappointed, though, at the brief exploration of those issues in McBride's own life.  It seemed like he didn't spend enough time developing the topics--maybe it was just too much for one book 
 Its a 15 year old book.  And of course Dr. McDougall has written many other newer books on similar subject matter.  Even so, it would sure be nice if he would revise this one.  A real classic 
 As a work/family expert and author of several books on the topic, I've read many books on the pyschological issues facing entrepreneurs today. Frankly, many of them seem to regurgitate the obvious and what has already been said. "Balance work and family", or "when you die, you won't wish you'd spent more time at the office." I was impressed with the breadth and debth of this book, exploring concepts not previously written about, and for the CEO or psychologist who wishes to understand this issue in greater debth, the author does not disappoint. You can skim this book for a new take on the issue, or devote an entire Sunday to it and sink yourself into the book , probably feeling like the author spent hours interviewing you before he wrote it. By the end you'll be convinced that the author knows you, at a level deeper than even your spouse or closest friend. This book is not for someone who wants a quick fix and a few easy ideas that will make all of the deeper issues go away. Rather, this book is for those courageous ones who are ready to examine this issue on a whole new level. Bravo to the author for leading the expedition. I hope this book opens up new conversations on the topic all over America 
 I read this book over 30 years ago and it remains one of the most impressive works I've ever read.  It was actually I book I got from the book club because I forgot to tell them not to send it to me.  I thought that I might as well read it and I was thoroughly astounded by what it had to say.  The author, Desmond Morris, takes a look at man as a part of the animal kingdom and gives us a portrait of a species only slightly above other genuses and species.  His examples and explanations are thoroughly compelling and one comes away presuaded.  The question is; persuaded of what?  Does "The Naked Ape" denigrate humans or elevate our fellow primates?  You decide when you read this most enjoyable work written by an author who knows how to communicate his ideas 
 Hello,  I have been a practicioner of Simpleology for some time and I must say that many aspects of Mark's system have helped me enormously.    A year ago today I was working a full time job I didn't like and making no money.  My friend Tellman Knudson introduced me to Simpleology and I thank him for that.  The 15 Minute PRaxis every morning has helped me immensely and even more beneficial is the Band OF Excellence that has exploded my business.,  Check it out,  Kyle Batti 
 this great toy isnt just for little kids my bff Kelly has these & she 12!! Imight write back so be afraid be very afraid! 
 I recommend this movie since I think it is the best of the whole 4 movies from George A. Romero it is a little more realistic than the other  
 C. McGhee Livers has done tremendous work in taking the original language from 4,000-year-old Greek & Hebrew texts and researching the semantics & language to reveal the true meaning of important Biblical scriptures.  She introduces her work through vocabulary and geneology lists & a map; and then it is a comprehensive, though highly readable exploration of word usage and sentence structure, with a focus on the Book of Genesis.   Chapters include The Garden of Eden, The Queen of Life, The Fall and Adhaim's Three Sons. Livers begins to bring everything together in The Curse of Cain and the summary contained in God's Word to Black Mankind is actually the penultimate coda. Please do not pass up the final chapter, The Story (Written For Children), which could have easily been an introduction to her work.  Documents do not lie, but the manipulation of interpretation has twisted the real meaning of the Holy Scriptures. Livers delivers a vitally powerful book that provides real meaning to the Bible. 
 My book arrived yesterday afternoon, and today at lunchtime it's already having a positive effect.  LOVE IT.  My daughter is smart and strong willed, so naturally she tries to assert her control over every interaction.  The 4 Step program pointed out where we were failing to curb the disrespect; me, in letting her backtalk too long before enforcing the consequences, my husband in snapping angrily at her instantly, but not disengaging.  The authors also do a great job illustrating what is backtalk and what is not.  "You call this food?!" is backtalk.  "Can I have a hotdog instead?" is not.  My daughter wanted to read the book herself,  but since she can't read yet, I read her the age-specific pages 65-66.  (The principles are the same for all ages, but the kinds of consequences can range depending on the childs development.  Sending a 5 year old to her room is different than sending a 15 year old.)    I don't think that being firm in handling disrespect (which is what backtalk is, really) contradicts a progressive, attachment-based parenting philosophy.  Would you let a stranger clerk at a store call you a poopy head?  You would handle the situation unemotionally, state your displeasure with the interaction, and leave the premises.  (I don't like being spoken to in that way.  I'll take my business elsewhere.)  That's the gist of this program.  "I don't like being spoken to in that way; it is disrespectful and unacceptable in this family.  You may not go play at your friend's house like you had planned."  And then disengage to remove the possibility of argument or negotiation.  An attachment-based relationship requires respect from both parties, and it's not just OK, it's necessary for parents to require respect in order to model that to their kids.    
 One of the most moving novels I have ever read.  Petry's novel displays naturalism at its finest.  More than that, it is an enjoyable, easy read!  I highly recommend it 
 I was really hesitant about buying this cd, but I heard a track from his album in a friend's car. I liked it enough to go out and buy his cd. Although I like his last two cd's alot more It's still worth getting...at least to have something to listen to in your car. LOL 
 Billy Crystal had me in stiches.  He is a wonderful storyteller and writer.  I bought four additional copies of this book after I finished mine, to pass out to friends. This is a definite must read for everyone 
 Peter Tremayne is the fiction pseudonym of a well-known authority on the ancient Celts, who has utilised his knowledge of the Brehon law system and 7th-Century Irish society to create a new concept in detective fiction.  The Sister Fidelma novels are taking on almost cult proportions and are becoming ever more popular with each offering from the author, whose obvious knowledge of the times and subjects he writes about shines out like a beacon on the shore.   It is the autumn of the year AD666 and Sister Fidelma has set out on a pilgrimage, her main task and thoughts are to reflect on her commitment to the religious life. Her work has to a degree isolated her from the life that a normal Christian Sister would live within the church.  However on the first night aboard ship a pilgrim is washed overboard, but was it an accident or a deliberate act of murder. Fidelma find herself involved in attempting to solve the mystery . .  
 An entertaining soap opera, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING succeeds especially because of its brilliant capturing of 1959.  The attitude, the fashion, the lifestyle, the vernacular and (both ennervating and bittersweet) the culture.    Once you've enjoyed the movie itself, sit back and relish the great commentary track with both the original novel's author and an amusing film historian.  You'll get quite a few chuckles along with fascinating facts about everything pertaining to the film and the times and circumstances around which it was made.  Wonderful to see so many great stars in all their colorful glory!  Also included, a trailer and newsreel.  Beautiful trasnfer.  A first rate DVD experience 
 This was needed for a class and the supplier got it right out and it arrived on time.  Very impressive 
 This movie to me is exactly what a fairly tail is suppose to be.  It is a little scary and a little dirty, just as the Grimm Brother's wrote them down.  Now a days this type of telling for a story tale might be considered deviant, but its really how they were meant to be told 
 This is a book that I think anyone interested in the Civil Rights movement should read. It will make you think about the Brown v. Board decision in a different way. The book puts the decision into the context of the times, while shocking you with Bell's main argument. While I found Bell's argument interesting, and parts of it compelling, I could not bring myself to endorse it full heartedly. I still side with the likes of Thurgood Marshall on this one 
 I too just loved this book!  I wasn't expecting such beautiful prose from Anna Quindlan.  This is my first venture into her novels.  I am mostly familiar with her Newsweek writings. She wrote this story with such a tender perspective of a woman Lydia Blessing in her eighties who lived through all the stages of life...young to very old.  Then as it seems by some miracle there came a change in her life with the hiring of a good man.  A young and well intentioned fella who finds a baby left on her property.  The baby, a little girl, is the center of love and hope within this story.  Skip's love for her and awe in the newness of her life unfolding to the world all about her creates a ripple effect in his own world.  I think Anna  Quindlan gives light to the notion that we all rescue each other every day in many ways.  Love is within us and all around us as we help, rescue, stumble, forgive, and make right each day.  
 When I read Oliver Twist, I literally could not put it down. I was getting in almost 90 pages per day!! It was so enticing, exciting, funny, suspensful, scary, whitty and downright fun. This is a testiment to Dickens' mastership, for it was his second book that he wrote. And personally, I think it is his best. Fagin, Oliver, Bill Sikes, The Artful Doger, Nancy, Mr. Bumble, Mr. Brownlow, Mrs. Maylie, all are wonderful characters that fit perfectly in this timeless masterpiece. Each of them have distinct personalities that are wonderful.  However, I deeply implore yo to READ THE UNABRIDGED VERSION!!! You will not understand most of the plot unless you read an abridged version.  Other than that, enjoy this wonderful masterpiece.  Oh and, Bravo Mr. Dickens, Bravo!! 
 How can one document the life of someone who spent the first 30+ years of his life as a poor, peasant cotton farmer?  It's not easy to get a good biography on such an individual, but blues fans and historians have for years been tracking down information on the life of Muddy Waters for decades, and in this book that information is compiled in a well written, informative biography.  This book explores Muddy's life on the plantation, his early interest in music, his love life, his family life, his desire to become a famous blues musician, his travels, his successes and his failures.  The author is blunt.  Obviously an admirer of Muddy Waters, the author does not hide the more shameful behavior of the great musician.  Coming out of this book, I admire Muddy Waters as a musician and band leader.  As a friend, a father, a husband, a person he is a disappointment. 
 Baghead is terrific - fun and funny and engaging on every page, with a surprise ending every kid will adore. I read it to a group of eleven-year-olds, and they loved it, too. What a delightful story - I'm glad I stumbled across this book 
 I bought and read the book last year.  The CD has been a great refresher and has additional resources and tools on it 
 Most readers aren't going to know the ancient meaning of most names, nor would they care to look it up if given the chance. I care less about the meaning and more about it's sound and context.   I have the earlier version of this book and just saw the new one at a book store. Amazon has it a lot cheaper so I'm getting it from here. At the store I was glad to see that more categories were added, i.e. Japanese names.   If I have a character, even a small one, who's italian or japanese I can go to the right section and pick one that sounds the best. There's even suggestions for last names. If I'm writing  a fantasy I can find names under whatever culture is similar to what I'm making up. Then you can always alter the name by changing spelling if you want.   This really is a good resource, though it probably won't be your only one. Still it's worth having. 
 As cast recordings go, many of them fail to bring the spirit of the show to life. However, this 1981 cast recording of Joseph Papp's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance hits the spot dead centre! Complete with dialogue, just like the D'Oyly Carte recordings of the 1960s, this is a superb reminder of a magnificent cast. The great pity is that, although Estelle Parsons is wonderful, the recording was not made when the original Ruth, Patricia Routledge, was in the cast. However, when it transferred from the Park to Broadway, she didn't go with it. Never mind, it makes up for it with a dream cast including Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstadt, Rex Smith and the one and only George Rose. A fine recording that every musical collecter (whether a fan of G&S or not) should own 
 This is some good electronic music, along with Chemical Brothers and Aphex Twin (Im just a n00b in electronic, although I want to get into it because the genre rules).  This is a lot better than all the ____ on the radio and what people call techno (i hate the usual mass techno, like We like to party, that really stupid and annoying song on the Six flags commercial).    My only real reccomendation is to listen to the samples.  Slim's music is catchy and cool, but it's not for everybody.  DO some resarch, because I know music is not cheap these days.  Check it out now.  The cd is not always listenable through the whole thing, it depends on the mood you are in, but hey, it's good.  The ______ oinlt thing would be good would be some rap, along with an instrumental version.  For no reason, Dr. Dre also did this with his 2001 record.  IF you can't figure out what I am saying, you are an idiot.   This is one of my first reviews I did without trying to be sarcastic and sturpid.  ____, it works so much better.  Un less your reviewing Paris Hilton ____ 
 My father was diagnosed with cancer and given six months to live.  This book became a bible of sorts.  My father changed his diet and followed other guidelines found in this book.  After five months the cancer was  completely gone and he's been cancer free for 17 years now.  This book was  primarily important for it's underlying mesage that "You Can Beat  cancer" and my dad is proof 
 As for bowls, I love em. However, they heat unevenly and the bowl gets too hot to pick up bare-handed in my Sharp microwave. 
 In terms of depth, this is the pinnacle of electronic music. It may not be as cohesive as Chemical Brothers' Dig Your Own Hole, but what Moby does here is breathtaking: he takes every kind of emotion, whether it's love("Everytime You Touch Me"), elation("Feeling So Real"), longing("All That I Need is To Be Loved"), hope("Into the Blue"), rage("What Love"), or peace("When It's Cold,I'd Like to Die") and abandons the notion of techno as pure dance music, and for that, Moby revolutionized electronica. This is the most important Moby album because of the diversity. This album has trance, classical, rave, hardcore...it is simply amazing. Everything great about Moby is right here. Play is also a great album, but if you want a tighter collection of songs, this is the place to start-no doubt. It's easy to love every note of this album. Brilliant 
 Finally a book written by an expert who cares about people.  This book is very straightforward and easy to read. Get it for yourself or for anyone you know who has a back problem 
 Couldn't believe that this was the same John Lithgow who starred in "Third Rock From the Sun", an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on NBC.  John plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by Denzel's character.  Wasn't expecting much, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining.  Yes, it was a little violent, and some parts were a tad unbelievable, but overall, Denzel and John were worthy antagonists.  Boy, Denzel sure was gorgeous!!  Still is.    
 The sense of actually being in the mid-1800's was so strong, that I felt I had to decompress to bring myself back to my own time.  And I did so very reluctantly. A wonderful story with amazing images! Highly recommended 
 I was skeptical at first and I am so happy that I got this for my kids. I homeschool my children and needed something to keep one of the kids busy while I was working with another. This is easy to use, fun to play and I like the stories that are available. I think you get a great product for a great price 
 Drawing on historical figures that are well-known and little known, plus women of her own family, O'Neal Parker has written a wonderful book that brings me from where we were to where I am now as a black woman in America. Working and married, (although not with children), I found each chapter had a lesson to teach and offered comfort in knowing I am not alone.  O'Neal Parker's thoughtful research in bringing us black women of history is especially welcome.  Excellent work that I will share with my friends, both black and not.  
 I definatley think to some degree this band sounds like Underoath. If you compare it to define the line underoath, they sound nothing alike. If you compare it to chasing saftey, take out all the screaming, make it a little softer and you get the almost Basically I would compare it to the clean chorus from chasing saftey which makes sense since its from the same guy. While I am spiritual and believe in Jesus, I'm definatley wouldn't concider myself Christian. The reason I say this is because this is definatley a Christian albulm most of the lyrics are talking about god or Jesus and its pretty litteral, I think most Christian bands seem to be more symolic in there lyrics then the almost. For example "Jesus, Jesus, theres something about your name, master, savor.." its pretty clear what hes talking about. For some people thats definatley going to turn them off completely. But if you are okay with that, this is a very good albulm. I think the best part of this CD is Aarons voice, while its good it won't even be concidered a amazing one. But his voice portrays honesty and emotion. It's hard to explain but there is just passion in his voice, you know he believes in what hes saying. Pretty much this albulm is good from beginning to end you can listen to every song. If I had to compare it to other bands I would say the poppy parts on Underoaths-chasing saftey, Taking Back Sunday and Anberlin 
 This is the most important book I have ever read. My partner and I finally understand WHy we made the mistakes.  Only then could we fix them and not repeat them.  If you read nothing else ever, read this book.  Your life will make complete sens 
 This was my first but their last so I have special memories.  This album might be seen as representing the downfall of the Pixies  just before they fell apart. The first three songs are by far the best and maybe among my all time 'best-first-three-songs-on-a-record' top 5. It has speed, great tempo changes and is very varied in sound. "Trompe Le Monde" is a great opener followed by a brilliant "Planet of a Sound" and the ode to architect "Alec Eiffel" with an ingenious outro with some weird sound and Frank's singing. "The Sad Punk" is also not a bad song, the choppy intro and the frantic singing makes a good mix. Maybe it's the anguish in Frank because he felt the band falling apart.  If you have never bought a Pixies album before don't get this one but any of the previous albums. If you do have some already you might still like it 
 This movie is full of action, adventure and creative characters without being violent and scary. My two boys loved it. It was loads of fun for my husband and I as well as there is plenty of comedy that transends generations. We have seen Spy Kids 2 as well but can't reccomend it as it contains more violence and the characters were pretty scary 
 Hans Zender has done an admirable job in recording successvily neglected contemporary works with the Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra from Saarbrucken. In fact you can quite soundly say this will be the only encounter with  these works,unless you scour the new music festival circuit in Europe for  months.And no composer is more neglected than Morton Feldman. Well not now  since his death in 1988,where practically his entire body of work has been  recorded. These various works featuring a solo instrument are really not  concertos I'd like to suggest that these works subvert interestingly enough  the concerto concept, and they do it rigorously. The Feldman you might know  is one attenuated to open beauty expansive with floating disarming-like  sounds in all registers with a deep feel for instrumental colour and  imbalance in a positive way. His aesthetic for his music has engaged visual  thinking particularly the American Expressionists who he knew  intimately,Guston,Rothko,Franz Klein and Motherwell. Feldman saw no  creative value in traditionalist post European theoretical perspectives one  engaging the serialized thinking. His music especially the piano solo works  sought a new aesthetic,one of formless yet structured dimensions. Sometimes  he embraces musical gestures too large for their frames, but this is the  experimentalist cast of his music,one shared by his early mentor John Cage.  Yet Feldman has always been committed to the aesthtic object whereas for  Cage it was always an indeterminate by-product of his art,one of blissful  surprise. The "Oboe and Orchestra" is oddly a deeply disturbing  work and you really don't recognize the Feldman I've been describing. The  oboe soloist exhorts a tortured sound screaming,twisting,contorting and  tearing its sounds in the strident upper registers. The orchestra as  accomplice fully gives graphic support to this with ominous low thunderous  rolls,and end-of-the-world-like sheets of brooding chords.Likewise the  "Flute and Orchestra" engages an anxiety-ridden melodic discourse  like something serious has happened yet we quite don't know the details,  and again the orchestra supports this Cassandra-like exhortations of the  state of the world. Yet the flute is beautiful with full-throated low  register gestures in its most rich register. This is a Feldman I never  encountered before one reflecting the negative expressionistic side of the  lifeworld. The "Piano and Orchstra" returns to the Feldmanesque  beauty at work, yet midpoint gives way to snarling brass and a menacing  muted trumpets with half-steps suggestive of Stravinsky's  "Rite".Yet the piano is bell-like and child-like,with  painstakingly crafted timbres which "accompany" the piano, these  orchestral moments are more as "supports" or screens or blankets  of sounds consistent with Feldman's penchant for the colour fields one  might encounter in Rothko. Oddly again the Harp is a hidden  accomplice,fascinating how when a tone is exposed it becomes a  revelation,like a resolution within the context of Feldman's anxiety-bound  concept at work here. All the soloist here enter and project as if they are  mere conduits, no personalities emerge,yet being soloist forces this  context on our musical perceptions. The incredible price(I was shocked) is  worth special mention here 
 I purchased this DVD set in 2001 and found it to be quite good, just I was a little disappointed with the Genesis DVD because it was not a movie and they could of done a movie instead of a documentary. 
 Dragon Bones is one of my favorite books. *I also like the seqeul Dragons Blood*   Ward has been considered a simpleton for a very long time and that suits him all to well until his father *who beat him almost senseless on occansion* dies and his uncle is being considered his father's hier. So Ward has to come out of his safety shell and defend his family and land. The only thing is how to become a sane man. Our faithful hero takes a chapter out of his hero's book Selieg. *I think that's how you spell it* and becomes a hero! Before he leaves though he brings along Oreg the casle ghost, a slave girl, his brother Tosten,his sister, whom he calls Brat, and his fathers man (who is actually half dwarf). So Ward sets off with his band of unlikely heroes. Yep so I hope that helped and hope you enjoy! ^. 
 I had not read a novel by Dan Chaon but this will not be my last. This is a unique, intertwined story about Troy, a man who loves his son but has his faults; Jonah, a lost "little boy" who is an adult coping in a world that he doesn't quite understand; and the distant story of their connection, their mother, Nora, whose sad life sets the tone for the next generation.  We delve into the story of each of them as they come of age, the story of Nora's early era contrasting interestingly with that of Troy's more druggie era and Jonah's self-reflective days. Troy was the son Nora gave up for adoption, Jonah was the one she kept--and who was the luckier? You will find out in this novel's unusual twists and turns.  The element of how Loomis, Troy's son, fits into the picture, is also colorful and augments the story with contrasting how Loomis is like Jonah, and the position that Troy has in the middle of them both.  This is the type of book for those who like the gentle unfolding of storylines. It is not an action-packed novel, but yet is fully interesting. What a great character study! Both Troy and Jonah unfold like gradual flowers, showing captivating nuances and self-reflection that applies to all of us.  This rich novel is surely a harbinger of even greater stories to come from this author. Do not miss this deep, moving, inspiring novel that has lessons for all of us 
 This is a book that every ecologist, botanist, conservation biologist, land manager and other environmental professional should read as they work to improve on the critical skills involved in conveying the importance of a healthy environment to "people" values that matter to Joe and Jane Public.  For undergraduate and graduate students in environmental studies, ecology, environmental science, environmental policy, environmental management and other related majors, it should be required reading in at least one of their courses.  Right now too many Americans think of environmentalism and conservation as a threat to our economy and quality of life.  That is clearly a major communications failure, because the there are in fact abundant ways that conservation can SAVE money, protect the public health, reduce risk of floods, fires, and other such disasters, reduce cancer risk, improve our energy independence and thus national security, and much more while also protecting the health of our environment.  Refer to www.ConservationValue.org for some outstanding examples.  Conservationists just need to do a better job of getting their message out there in a way that will resound positively with the public, and this book is a great starting point for learning how to do so 
 This was a christmas gift for a relative. As far as I know, he is enjoying it. Thank you and have a prosperous new year 
 This book is a treat, and I'm looking forward to a sequel!  I have read Kelly McCullough's short fiction, and was looking forward to seeing his novel.  WebMage did not disappoint!  The action is constant, the characters are real and accessible.  This book kept me up nights - for all the right reasons.  As for the problems some readers had with the book:  I know nothing about coding except that it's based on zeros and ones.  That didn't stop me from enjoying WebMage.  Also, I have loved reading Zelazney for years, but found the Amber novels too scattered.  I like WebMage better 
 It works pretty good, although sometimes it take 5 tries to turn the light on. Also the backing of the light where you hook the book is very very tight and does not go out at all so its hard to connect the light to books without ruining the pages 
 Excellent for all levels of lifters.  The authors do not pretend to know it all but offer a fresh, informative, funny no-nonsense approach to acheiving results through weights, be it fat-loss, strength or muscle gain 
 I passed the PMP test on my first try on September 25th 2006. My preparation material:  1. The PMP Exam: How to Pass On Your First Try(Andy Crowe) 2. PMP Exam Prep, Fifth Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam(Rita Mulcahy) 3. PM FASTrack: PMP Exam Simulation Software, Version 5 (CD-ROM)(Rita Mulcahy) 4. PMBOK  I read Andy Crowe's book twice. I felt that it has a lot of information in a very easy to read format. I actually liked it better than Rita's book since Andy explained certain confusing concepts VERY clearly. His writing style is very easy to read without putting you to sleep. He covered all the material from PMBOK and more. On the other side, the sample questions in his book are too easy. I used Rita's book more as a supplement, but it's a good book to study as well. I used Rita's CD for practice tests and questions. I read the PMBOK 2 days before the exam just to see if there's anything the other books missed and there was none. 
  If you have ever had a friend who tells you stories that should stand on their own, but instead must continually prop them up by reminding you how funny they are and how funny other people thought they were, then you have an idea of this book. You are told in each synopsis that each movie was so bad it was funny, but rarely does it come across as to why this is so. This may be more a fault of the format than the author, but as someone else stated- you're expecting something livlier from the creator of the Razzies. Still, I enjoyed it, and would give it a nod because of the sheer number of bad movies it lists, and the information it gives. However if you are looking for less of a reference book and more of a humor book, you'll probably want to keep looking.  
 This book, to me, was GREAT!  It made me want to go to camp. It had  a lot of feeling words in it that made it like a Diary or a Journal. When it came to other parts, like adventure parts, it got me all excited. Like, "WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?  Paula Danziger is my favorite author. I  hope she keeps writing books 
  I am a chemistry major and so I really like this book, however when I initially started o-chem, I did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook. So I suggest, to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at Hornback or McMurry.   The text isnt an "Advanced" textbook perse (after a good grounding in the basics for three days, I found this book quite user friendly), its organization is completely different to most other o-chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic. Both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity.  An examples is that when introducing orbitals, and orbital interaction; Greeves et al quickly go to HOMO and LUMO based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding. Wade and McMurry leave this, one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later.  A second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals, lone pairs and charge. These are the things used to identify em.  As such, the book isnt fragmented. Each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry. Chapters are well referenced so if, say you are only interested in NMR then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding. Most textbooks act like a stupid monologue, miss a passage and you'd completely miss organic chem.  The chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant, it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept (i.e. Jacobs).   However, the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry. Principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge.   Organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors. FOr individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry; I would suggest you look elsewhere. A substitute (a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry) is Hornback's which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry.  
 Savannah Breeze was a fun read containing all the elements, fun, adventure, and romance 
 This book provides an easy to understand overview of estate planning plus easy to understand detail on many special circumstances.  It is very easy to understand which estate planning techniques are right for you, and there are many examples that illustrate how the techniques work.  Approximately half of this book is relevant to everyone.  The other half gives clear, common sense explantions of advanced planning techniques that are typically reserved for those fortunate enough to be planning a high net worth estate (lets say $1M+).  The advanced techniques are not for do it yourselfers, but the book gives you a good understanding of the issues and lets you converse intelligently with an attorney 
 I loved this book! The combination of personal growth/intraspection, Virginia history and horses is just more than I can pass up.  The plot of historical time travel was a novel (no pun intended) approach and very enjoyable 
 This record has been immortalized in the past few years as the crate-diggers and backpackers bible. Every single year, with another list marking the best of the past 10 years, 50 years, and maybe even millenium, Endtroducing has become a musical canon. Whether this allegation is factually true, it has become a canon for an entire generation of people who bought turntables instead of guitars. And rightly so: This disc is THE essential record for sound collages. The rampant sampling of the eighties reached the nineties with such cynicism that with the release of this record changed an entire generation's idea of what a song is supposed to be like. For the youth of today, the music they listen to is inevitably tinged with the influences of this record. DJ Shadow had taken sampling to a point where only keyboards could replicate the intricacy in which he used records.  That being said, Endtroducing stands the test of time, firmly implanting itself in popular cultures lexicon of important records. Endtroducing has far exceeded even the largest expectations: perfect production and album arrangement greeted by overwhelmingly positive reviews and an ever-growing fan base. Some people consider the record an emotional masterpiece, others an aural marthon, and some even think of it as turntablism at its finest. Quite frankly, it is truly the first musically post-modern piece of music in the recording art industry. While certainly neither the first to sample nor investing in a large amount of samples, the direction, focus, and articulation of a generation can be surmised within the record. It is the death and rebirth of the recording industry all at once. Josh Davis captured it perfectly: funk becomes ominous, break-beats become convulsive, instruments are used sparingly, and scratching becomes welcomed. It is a record that cannot be overlooked and cannot be forgotten. Now commemorated in this deluxe edition, we finall get to look at Shadow from the lens by which he viewed the parts that made up his record: antiques destined to die unless someone revives them.  The second disk of redos and remixes is like butter on toast. It may not be the most essential thing to have yet it grants further insight into the scope and variety this record can/would represent. From the decidedly dancable overhaul of "Organ Donor" to Cut Chemist's mayhem of "Number Song," the variety of perspectives and directions the album could have taken is immediately apparent. It is the kaleidascope from which to view the world of Endtroducing, granting variety and intrigue to the many pieces that make up this grand collective.  Coupled with a live performance at the end of the disc, Endtroducing is finally given the proper platform which it deserves. For fans who have all the vinyl, it can be a redux and a compilation by which to listen to some of the most defining music of the decade. For the unassuming viewer, this record is immediately accessible and mandatory. You're cutting yourself short by missing out on this Deluxe Edition 
 Before you start this book you should know that any resemblance between the book and the movies that Hollywood has turned out is completely accidental. The names of the main characters are about the only similarity that I could find and as is the norm, the book was much better.  This, the last installment in the Musketeer series, gives us the story of the final acts of our heroes, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan. Unlike many literary characters our Musketeer friends have aged as the story progresses and have all retired but D'Artagnan who is still the Captain of the King's Musketeers. Athos and Porthos are quite wealthy and Aramis has attained the rank of Bishop. Aramis is not content with his station however and knows a secret that he thinks he can use to become Pope. This secret is the knowledge that Louis XIV has a twin brother who is hidden away in the Bastille and Aramis is quite sure that this brother would make a better King than the current monarch. Aramis is also pretty sure that the new King in gratitude will nominate his liberator for the office of Cardinal and then will scheme to make the new Cardinal Pope.  In this plot Aramis acts alone except for some help from Porthos who has no idea what he is involved in. The twins are successfully switched for a short while but then the plot falls apart and Aramis and Porthos flee for their lives although Porthos is still not sure what is going on. The "pretender" to the throne is left to his own devices by Aramis and is imprisoned in a new location with the iron mask added to his discomfiture. Aramis does not come across in this book as much of a hero and in many respects this story is much darker than it's predecessors.   Given the advanced age of the Musketeers, there are not nearly as many swashbuckling adventures as one is accustomed to but on occasion Porthos in particular will rise to the challenge. The political intrigues of the Court of Louis XIV and the decline of the Musketeers are in fact the main plot lines of this story. In the end, only one of the four is left and to find out which one you will just have to read the book. Athos, by the way, only seems to play a side role in this story and is neither involved in the plot against the King or in his rescue.   As is always the case, Dumas' writing style is superb and is filled with historical fact. He does tend to be a bit wordy and his books are often much longer than necessary but even with this slight drawback he ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors. In this book Dumas closes out the careers of his most popular characters and he does it with style 
 This book was good. I have been reading it for a few days and I have not been able to put it down. It is a bit long though. It is about a girl named Emily whose mother is very sick. Well she finally dies and so the girl goes to live with her uncle eventually where she learns a horrible secret about the man who has always been there for her and has given her a home. Finally, Emily must make a decision that will have a very big impact on her lif 
 The moral of the story is really good because it teaches kids to always be nice to peole no matter what. Even if people are are mean to you it is important to always be nice and polite and this book does a great job of teaching that. It helps kids see what can happen when people dont treat other people like they would want to be treated. The illustration in this book were very cute. They were very creative and they kept kids interested.  This really is a great book and kids would really like to listen to this story. They would enjoy the illustations and they would remember the characters long after reading the book. 
 Over twenty years have passed since Edward Loy left Dublin for the United States, but the private investigator returns home for his mom's funeral.  On the same day his mother is buried, an old school chum, Linda Dawson tongue kisses Edward while asking him to locate her missing husband Peter gone four days.  Though he struggles with the concept of tonguing one man while allegedly missing your spouse, Edward agrees to investigate as his mother's death serves as a reminder of his tragedy back in L.A. that has left him with a bottle as his only comfort; this is an opportunity to begin the climb back out of the alcoholic haze.  Loy follows Peter's last known trail, which leads him to a corpse in town hall.  From there he runs afoul of an organized crime mob, the IRA, and the Garda; each in their own style warning him to not just back off, but to go back across the ocean.  Other murders and more kisses follow as Loy continues his inquiries refusing to allow anyone to scare him off as death seems easy compared to the fall into the ooze beneath the food chain that he already has taken.  Although there are too many subplots intruding in this violent exhilarating Irish private investigative tale, readers will appreciate Loy's first person lament.  What is fascinating is the comparison between Loy's "world" filled with hostility and cruelty vs. the pastoral setting of Dublin.  Loy is an interesting protagonist whose hard boiled investigation makes for a fun armchair tour of the Irish capital.  Harriet Klausner 
 Alot of kids feel that reading is stupid but this book will change their  minds.  This book will make you laugh and is also a very educational book that teaches the young minds how to rhyme. Many kids think that reading is stupid, but this book makes it fun with silly rhymes 
 I got this for my 8 year old son .  He had a blast, moving, jumping, waving his hands, playing the game.  My 4 year old daughter easily picked up the games too ( Bubble Pop is her favorite). I love the "Anti-grav" demo game and intend on getting the actual game later on. It is amazing technology at work ... This is not a passive, PS2 game at all and you can break a sweat while playing.  That's what I call fun !! We can even make funny videos of ourselves and see ourselves perform on TV !!!  That is cool! 
 This book introduces us to Priya, who was born and raised in India and then left for the US to attend college. Once in the US, Priya meets a man, falls in love, gets engaged and has to figure out how to break it to her parents. Priya heads back to her home land and things get more complicated. Priya's family is a mix of interesting characters, some you like and some are more difficult to understand. This was a quick read for me and also an enjoyable one 
 Personally, my favorite gymnast is Olga Korbut.  But I like Nadia , too.  This book was great.  I could really understand why she became successful and superstar.  I like the part Nadia has 10 rules to live by, and she knows the  secret of success since when she was such a young age.  That's very amazing.   Her rules gave me power.  Nadia is a very strong super woman.  However, there are some disappointments , she never talks about her teammate Teodora Ungureanu, who seemed to be her good friend during the 1976 Olympics.  Teodora was also a great gymnast who later was a wonderful and daring circus performer.  She also never talks about amazing gymnast Olga Korbut.   Nadia's performance was perfect (1976 Olympic)  but, I never even noticed  the" Comaneci Salto" until I read about it in her book.  Olga Korbut's back flip on uneven bars and her beam performance, her 1972 floor exercise was much more big impact, artistic, creative and unbelievable performance. Nadia compliments only herself and her coach and her family.   and also compliments Mary Lou Retton ????  what a joke ????  I understand Nadia is not very interested in other performers.  If she was just a litte more humble and  with a sense of  humor, this book could be more fun to read.  
 I was a smoker for 17 years- believing I really enjoyed it.  I had quit almost a dozen times prior, trying all types of aids- from hypnotherapy & acupressure, to nicotine replacements & zyban to cold turkey!!!  All would work for about 2-3 weeks and then I would give in.  Typically, I would be very angry because I "missed" smoking and would give in OR any time I would have a drink/ be at a bar.  That was always the time I would think I could have "one".   After reading this book, my last cigarette was June 11, 2006 and I have been able to easily walk away from the cigarettes- for good!!!!!!! I encourage ANY smoker who is having trouble quitting to read this- good luck - you can quit!!!! Thanks Allen!! 
 The original compiler/editor, Hugh Holman, had created a classic--probably the best handbook to literature (almost exclusively English and American) available.  The latest edition (10th) has everything that Holman had, with some modifications and additions.  One of best features of Handbook is its invaluable time-line at the end, covering every major book and author in every major period of English literature, side-by-side with a chronology of American literature 
 It is a compelling book about one of this country's greatest politicians. One can not help but compare President Lincoln to leaders in our lifetime.  Lincoln was vilified, denounced as a buffoon, and called incompetent by his rivals for office.  Yet they were defeated.  He was considered a novice among leaders, with limited experience.  Yet he led his cabinet and country with skills that were unparallel through the most tumultuous times in our history.  They called him a backwoods lawyer with limited communicative skills.  Yet he became one of the most eloquent speakers in our history.  I learned and was reminded of many lessons while reading this monumental piece of American history.  One lesson is that people can live up to levels of expectation created within themselves. I recommend this book as a definitive guide for anyone in a leadership position and for all who have been told at some point in their lives; "It  can't be done!"   Reginald V. Johnson, Author, "How To Be Happy, Successful And Rich"   
 Miles doesn't love shows on the WB (0r CW), he doesn't gush about J. Lo's posterior.  He doesn't rave about the football team's wins.  Miles  loves famous last words.  Teenagers have depth.  They feel things tremedously.  They are real people with real problems, real joys, and real angst.  It's nice to see them portrayed realistically in this novel by Green as opposed to the happily ever after teens found in other bubblegum YA novels.  Miles has no friends.  He is lonely.  He has two wonderfully warm parents (whom he even admits as 'such nice people'), but it's not enough.  He wants a chance to get away, become a new person, search out the Great Perhaps.  So, he embarks on a coming of age story.  And what a story it is.  He attends a private boarding school in Alabama where he finally makes friends.  He finds a place for himself.  Through his friend and roommate, Chip, and a quirky, moody girl, Alaska, Miles discovers who he is.    Green creates beautifully tragic characters in this novel.  They make you want to find all the troubled kids in the world and talk to them.  Listen to them.  And make sure that they don't say their last words too soon 
 There's a reason this book is a standard in the field. It explains both fact and theory, in just enough depth, to support HR generalist efforts.  The current edition -- for those of us who haven't seen the inside of a school for quite a few years -- features on-line resources that are particularly useful in work situations.  Call it a textbook for OJT.  
 I thought I was going give this a bad rating because I hated Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw so much that I couldn't bear to read any more, but that's the reason why I gave it high marks!  It's been awhile since a novel has brought out such feelings in me!  Frankly, Cathy and Heathcliff deserved one another; I hated Cathy because she was so selfish she did not deserve to be loved by anyone with a good heart, like Edgar; I hated Heathcliff because he was such a monster with no heart towards anyone else other than Cathy.  I was sick to my stomach the way he punished those around him.  I don't know why Heathcliff was so fond of Cathy either.  There was nothing about her to love!  I loved Missus Dean though.  She had the strongest spirit and I found her a refreshing character amidst the madness of all the others.  This book was incredibly tragic and even hard to get through because it is such a downer.  It's like when you think it couldn't get worse, it does!  I didn't give the book 5 stars, however, because I found the ending weak and abrupt.  Other than that, a worthwhile read!  
 I'm always interested in how guitar heroes make the leap to singing and making a solo record. Playing for Tin Machine (w/Bowie) and The Cure has surely paid off as his songwriting, singing and, of course, guitar playing are impeccable! Loving the disc from beginning to end... am glad to say that it was well worth the wait! Enjo 
 Earl Swagger is immersed in the deep south investigating Thebes Penal Farm - an all negro penal ranch, set against the backdrop of the murky 50's and racial divisions of the Southern US. Accepting that our hero is of almost superhuman prowess wears a little thin after a while, as he continually weathers horrific mistreatment at the hands of the villians, and stills comes out on top. This aspect aside, this is better than an average, and by no means dime store drivel. I am new to Mr Hunters writing and what first appeared as something of a tome at over 550 pages actually flew quite quickly, and bobs the reader along at a steady pace. Some interesting twists in the plot and excellent character development without being over descriptive more than adds to the flavor, and the end result is a pleasing read. Not one that will live in the memory for many years I felt after finishing it, but certainly worth a look, and a great vacation or travel companion. Enjo 
 This is a little dated, and yet it is timeless information. It would be best to use this at the suggested time, before your kid hits puberty. However, just the fact that you will be spending some quality, alone time with your child is huge. Highly recommend this for any parent to use. Especially since so many parents just hope this phase will pass, and they won't have to really deal with the issues of puberty 
 "ABBA The Movie" is a difficult film to rate because it is really two movies in one.  The first is a documentary of the Swedish pop music group ABBA's early 1977 tour of Australia.  The second is a fictionalized story line about an Australian country DJ, who attempts during most the movie to obtain an interview with ABBA.  The DJ also devotes a great deal of screen time to interviewing ABBA fans.  The documentary portion of the film contains outstanding live concert footage of ABBA's performances at various venues throughout the country.  Photography by the film's director Lasse Halstrom is excellent.  I counted 17 live song performances and two additional songs in video format.  Granted, most of the filmed performances were not complete songs, but any ABBA live concert footage is extremely rare today.  It is available on DVD only in this film and in "ABBA in Concert," which records portions of ABBA's 1979 tour of North America and Europe.  If you buy only one of these disks, I recommend "ABBA The Movie."  There are more songs on this disk and the camera work here is better than that of the 1979 tour.  The storyline of this film is a distraction and unnecessary.  The DJ interviews a seemingly endless number of ABBA fans and after the first two or three, we get the point: Australians are crazy about ABBA.  Anyone interested in this film today is obviously focused on the music, so it is somewhat frustrating when the film cuts away twice from ABBA's first live concert, in Sydney, to show the DJ denied entry to the concert.  Later, the film cuts away from another live concert to show the DJ conducting fan interviews and attempting to schedule an interview with ABBA.  This film would have been much better had it been constructed along the lines of Martin Scorsese's "The Last Waltz," which was released at approximately the same time.  In "Waltz," Scorsese filmed a complete concert by "The Band" and between musical numbers presented in depth interviews with the performers, not fans.  On the other hand, "ABBA" has mostly excerpts from songs and very little is discussed about group members or their music.  A snippet of an ABBA press conference early in the film reveals that some people regard Agnetha's (the blond's) "bottom" as the "sexiest" in show business, an assessment that is supported by subsequent concert footage.  But little of any real substance is revealed about the Swedish group.  In fairness to Mr. Hallstrom, he thought that presenting a feature length film comprised of only concert performances would not hold an audience's interest for two hours and few, if any, would have predicted, at the time the film was made, that the public would be clamoring for live ABBA concert footage nearly 30 years later.  Although the DVD has been released in Europe, Australia and Canada, it has not been released in the US.  It is my understanding that the Canadian version of the disk is the only one that will play on US DVD players and is available only in a single disk format.  I purchased my DVD from a Canadian based internet marketer.  As stated above the photography in this film is excellent, but the video transfer from film to DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  Portions of the video have a grainy quality, even with my DVD player set on progressive scan and using a high definition TV.   The audio in both DTS and Dolby 5.1 is wonderful.  The DVD offers subtitles in English, Spanish and Portugese.  There are no "extras" on this disk.  Included with the DVD is an 18 page booklet containing photographs and text giving interesting background on the tour and film.  This DVD stumbles however when it comes to the chapter menu.  This film was on cable TV earlier in 2005, and I recorded it on a digital video recorder.  Before buying the DVD, I watched this movie on multiple occasions on my DVR and, after the first or second viewing, watched it by fast forwarding through the plot portions and watching only the music.  Surprisingly, Universal Music provided no menu on this disk to access only the music.  Making the situation even worse, the chapter menu is arbitrarily chopped up into segments that bear no logical relation to different parts of the film.  Chapters actually start in the middle of musical numbers, making the chapter menu virtually useless, if you want to watch only the music.  Finally, every time I play my disk, there is a momentary pause in the middle of "Why Did It Have to be Me?"  I do not know if this is a defect in my disk or it is a manufacturing problem that is common to all disks.  In summary, the music portion of this DVD rates a strong five stars, but the silly plot and the problems with the disk discussed above, bring this DVD down to a four star production 
 This wonderful book on male/female relationships has helped more than anything I've ever read. It is respectful of both men and women and contains a wide group of people interviewed. In addition there are many experts quoted in this book. Many top doctors and psychologists have joined in. There is never anything disrespectful in the book. The review which said that there was a man talking about being brutal and including other sexual references is just a complete lie and hoax. There is nothing in the book like this. This book has helped many. It will also help you 
 This album makes for a perfect comanion during dark autumn nights. Cuddle up, open a bottle of red and enjoy. 
 This is a Rankin/Bass classic and one of my favorite Easter specials.  The use of the Mailman character from "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town" creates a wonderful link between the holidays.  I easpecially love how all of the Easter traditions are explained in such a whimsical manner!  
 In "Andrei Rublev" Tarkovski illuminates an era in which great faith and great brutality coexist side by side.  On one hand you see this world of great Christian artists, who live for their work.  On the other hand, you see the world of invaders.  Remember the scene where the invaders lock the entire village in a church?  The torture scenes are not very grafic, but the implications will make you sick to your stomach.  At some point they invaders pour melted metal into the mouth of one of their victims, to silence his prayers, and then put a sack over his head and drag him outside, tied to a horse.  And between these two world is a world of pagans.  They are a cast suspended between the two universes.  They are Russians but not Christians.  They are an echo of the heathen Russia.  Tarkovsky shows that Ortohdox Russians treat their heathen breathren with the same brutality as they themselves were treated by invaders.  
 I have owned this book for 18 yrs and am buying another copy because I wore the 1st one out.It covers Just about everything a tinkering homeowner could want.It has a great amount of info useful to the homesteader or anyone interested in the way things used to be done.I have used it for raising chickens,grapes,gardening and making maple syrup.I also like the firewood section.I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to tinker 
 I liked this book so much I ordered the movie. It reads well, however it is a bit contrived so many events would be unlikely to happen.  Character development is realistic.  Overall this is about as good as it gets for pleasure reading! 
 This is without a doubt the best book on model rocketry I've ever seen, and I read it from cover to cover. It deals with every aspect of rocketry in a very accessible manner (for example, presenting formulas for various calculations, but not requiring their use). It is organized so that the reader can focus on single aspects of a rocketry program (for example, separate chapters on aerodynamics, rocket propulsion, recovery systems, altitude measurement). I am a science teacher and coach to two Team America Rocketry Challenge teams, and I keep copies of this book available for my teams as reference. I wish it had more information on electronic payloads, but that is a more advanced topic, so it is very forgivable. If you own only one book on rocketry, this is the one to buy 
 For the money, the package containing two docking/charger multipurpose cables, AC and car charger adapters, and the silicone skin case was a great deal!  Overall this was a great buy for me.  The only criticisms I can make are (1) the skin was a bit thicker than I had envisioned.  However, the slightly thicker form factor my Zen Vision M with the skin is balanced by the added drop protection.  And (2) the skin covers the lighted blue buttons giving the whole player a slightly less cool appearance.  Having said that, I'd gladly make this purchase again given the opportunity 
 Subtitled, 'The Story of Hannah Breece', Jacobs has gathered her aunt's  journals and diaries, as well as US government data relating to Alaska  during the years 1904-1917 and has written a fascinating history.  Hannah  Breece served as a US government funded public school teacher in a number  of remote sites in the then newly admitted state of Alaska.  Her students  were Aleuts, Eskimos, Russians, and children of other more obscure  nationalities and ethnicities.  Although Breece tells her own story in a  less passionate, emotional voice, the story itself, is a powerful one.   This is a biography of a single woman in her forties and fifties, thousands  of miles from her family in Pennsylvania, teaching native peoples, not only  English and math and science, but gardening, sewing, cooking, and a variety  of other more domestic skills.   Her tales of the extreme weather, the  isolation, the conflicts and discrimination between the different ethnic  groups, and of her travel, which took place from the Kodiak Islands, to  Wrangell, to Fort Yukon, are astonishing and provide an illuminating  glimpse of life in a different time, and in a far-away place.  In the last  quarter of the book the author, Breece's niece, brings together some of the  historical data that Breece leaves unmentioned in her journals.  We learn  more about the US government constraints, policies, and employees all  functioning or not at the time 
 I think the audio CD may be the way to go on this book as opposed to the printed form. I noticed other reviewers didn't like the printed book for various comic strip graphics; this was obviously non existant and thus not disappointing in the audio CD (the way I chose from the library)   The narrator of the story is Carol Monda, and her voice is adequate, not melodramatic or tiresome. She does all the voices of characters in this story, and it works. But let's get to the story:  Although some reviews have suggested that Picoult tried to include too many themes in this story, I don't agree. The crafting of it and the detail worked for me. Fascinating portrayal of marriage, parenthood,adolescenct angst, and rape told by the main characters in the story (a family). Trixie, a 14 year old girl raised by a father (Daniel Stone) who is an artist and her mother  who is a classics professor at a university.  So from the beginning, it's refreshing because it's told from the perspective of a "stay at home Dad" and the relationship he has with his daughter, and his wife. Gradually, the reader/listener learns about Daniel Stone's past and childhood, about the kind of father and husband he is.   Early into the book, it also becomes suspenseful due to the crime factor of alleged rape. Point of view occasionally shifts to the police detective on the case, although I found this character somewhat flat. Note: there is explicit description of various sexual acts and the collection of evidence after a rape. This was completely in line with the story, current in today's society, and not tawdry or excessive, in my opinion.   I found the pace quick, and expect it would be a page turner. It took about 13.5 hours of listening time on CDs.   The author heavily uses metaphor and simile, sometimes to the point of distraction, although it is all effectively written. I especially enjoyed the allusions between the story line and the classics lectures on Dante's Inferno, woven into the book through Laura Stone's profession. Even if you have never read Dante, Picoult makes it accessible and relevant. You might even find yourself wanting to read Dante's Inferno after you finish the book.  I wouldn't say the outcome was obvious, although I did correctly predict the ending of the story about halfway through. It would have been better if it had not turned out the way I expected; still, it was intense at times, moving and painful.  Characterizations are rich and detailed.  A portion of the story is told in the setting of Alaska,with native language and it adds to the texture and tone of the story. Several native words are used, pronounced and defined in a clear way, to enrich the narrative and tie in symbolically and literally one part of the tale to another. As the cover photograph suggests, the setting is cold, the language is evocative of just such a bitter winter.   Recommede 
 Nominated for Best Picture Oscar in 1936, Jack Conway's screwball comedy is a raucous farce buzzing with zany humor, thanks to a flurry of impeccable one-liners delivered by Powell and Loy, reunited from their initial pairing in "The Thin Man." Playing the newspaper's frantic editor and his continually jilted fiancée, Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow round out the stellar foursome. (Harlow, Powell's real-life love, would die tragically only months after filming was completed. 
 Still having some slight problems with going potty on the toilet but goes to pee every time.  He transitioned well to his new toilet seat and even sat on it while I had it on the floor before installing.  
 This is a good book on the subject, with thorough coverage of the topic and prose aimed at the nonlawyer.  In my situation a corporation was a better choice, and the book helped me come to that conclusion 
 This is a good book for children who does not understand the meaning of working together. Also, this book was structured very intelligently; so that any reader can follow the same story but from other people point of views. In addition; the way the author painted colorful pictures of the city was very unique. 
 It's a great book that gives briefs, but very good comments, about the artists and their work 
 Little Einsteins are absolutely delightful in all angles. Worth the extra dollars for the book compared to the others. You'll never find Little Einsteins or RoliePolie Olie for 2.50 on the Walmart rack, because this is a good quality book that your child will love. Great color, great quality in paper for a paperbook.  **Here's a helpful tip----leave your child the inexpensive, dollarstore hardcover or boardbooks on the floor for your child to read on his/her own, but put these more expensive and better quality books up high on a shelf for supervised "special moments" when you read together. This way the book is always taken care of for repeated reading which everyone enjoys. ** 
 L.A. Woman by The Doors *****  The Doors are one of those bands that in my book can do little wrong. Almost everything the critics said effected their music I only think made it better. The seemed to get better with every album they made or at the least more experimental and creative. The Doors will always be high on my list of the all time greatest bands. Easily in the top ten. L.A. Woman is in my opinion one of the bands all time best albums, more blues then the others, yet still psychedelic and full of great lyrics, musician ship, and of course passion for the music they were playing. On this album I think Robbie Krieger's guitar playing was at an all time best along with his song writing. Ray Manzerek's keys are amazing as always adding nice textures to the songs, and John Densmore's jazzy drumming fits perfectly. Jim's voice sounds amazing here and his lyrics are astounding as always.  The album starts of with `The Changeling' which is a heavy blues song that contains some of Jim Morrison's all time best vocals. definitely the very best song to open the album. `Love Her Madly' is one of the biggest hits the band ever had and is one of their most recognizable classics. Great acoustic guitars and awesome lyrics by the great Robbie Krieger. The song sounds very 1960's and very cool. `Been Down So Long' is a nice song with killer guitar playing by Robbie Krieger. The slide guitar solo reminds me of the late Duane Allman at the height of his playing, very good indeed. The lyrics are nice and blues and it's a very cool song to just sit back on and listen to, one of my favorites on the album. Next is the nice slow blues of `Cars Hiss By My Window.' While I think it is the weakest song on the album I do think it is still a very good song. It's the kind of song you would love to listen to while relaxing. The guitar as again is superb. The drumming is nothing special but it works perfect for the song. The lyrics are perfect, classic blues lyrics all the way which make this an excellent song.   The title track is next. `L.A. Woman' is one of the greatest songs ever written, it is as simple as that! Easily the best song on the album, and one of The Door's all time best. Jim Morrison's lyrics are the stuff of legend. Perfect, and his vocal performance is brilliant. Manzerek keys are great, Densmore's quick beats keep the song on a rollin.' Robbie Kriegers all time best guitar playing is here. Forget `The End' `Light My Fire' and `When The Music Is Over.' This song alone shows what an underrated guitarist he is, truly one of the best!		  `L'America' sounds like Door's of old. Very 1960's and very psychedelic. The track sounds very spacey and out of this world. Nothing very special but still a pretty cool song. `Hyacinth House' is another song that sounds like something from earlier Door's albums like Waiting For The Sun. It's a nice song with self pitting lyrics by Morrison and great guitar from Krieger. `Crawling King Snake' is a John Lee Hooker cover, which the boys pull off wonderfully. I think it is actually better then the original which is saying a lot because the original is a classic which influenced many people to pick up playing guitar. `The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)' is a killer song and I never understood how it didn't become a hit single. The song is just out of this world, it truly is one of the best songs the band ever recorded. The album comes to a climactic close with one of the bands most memorable songs, the classic `Riders On The Storm.' Amazing production, rain falling in the background, great keys, wonderful vocals and lyrics. This mellow/eerie haunting song is about a killer is the best song to close the album. It's eerie how the song about a killer closed the bands final album.  While L.A. Woman is certainly not the bands best album it is one of their best. Concerned by many to be one of the all time greatest albums in rock and roll history.  It's just a sham this was the bands final album because this shows you where they were headed and it could have been amazing 
 Under 200 pages, well written, loaded with references and end notes.  Greg has a fairly unique ability as a writer to provide meaningful information and objectivity while keeping it interesting and concise.  His ability and experience in the field allows him to catch on to things that slip past others.  I've been a big fan of The Daily Grail for many years and the massive amounts of news and information it produces.  His work both in this book and on Sub Rosa magazine takes that to an even greater level in terms of quality.  To learn more, I'd recommend checking out the Daily Grail website and doing a search on "strange constructions".  You'll find a sample chapter from the book there.  Anxiously awaiting both Dan Brown and Greg Taylor to produce their next master pieces.. 
 I purchased this previously read book as a gift.  It is CLEAN in language and story line.  It is educational (flora and fauna, etc.) and about people with good moral values.  When I finished reading the book I wanted more, so I've read more of Gene Stratton Porter's books and shared them with my friends 
 I can't recommend this book too highly. I have been working in this field for years and have searched for a book that would not turn off people struggling to come to terms with addictive problems. This book is easy to read, concise and presented in a manner that invites the reader to stay with the material. In addition to giving great information on the biology of addiction, it is full of excellent suggestions on how to practically go about attacking the problem. And it is optomistic! So important when someone feels overwhelmed by the problem and has struggled, often unsuccessfully, to change behaviors that are self-defeating. I would also advise relatives and friends of addictive persons to use this book to help them cope better with this issue and to find hope 
 With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.    The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all.  I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.      
 I was searching for a book that would fully cover both old and new (2005) features of T-SQL.  This is the only one in the market that is actually doing so.  But, more then that, the first chapter alone that explains how SQL works logically in human coherent language is worth the price of the whole book.  And the other chapters are of same excelent quality.  This is the best book about the subject in the market and I am sure to buy the sequel (about T-SQL programming.) Z 
 Over this past year, I have had several set backs starting a fitness routine resulting in injuries.  As a working professional and mother of two, it's challenging to carve time out for fitness.  I am looking for optimal results with limited time.  Peak Perfmance Fitness is a  great resource for developing a solid fitness foundation.  Jennifer Rhodes has a gift for providing practical, simple explanations for how to prevent injury and develop an effective fitness plan.  The diagrams and step-by-step instructions are a real value add 
 The first two chapters of this wonderful book were so overwhelmingly sad I almost choked while reading them aloud to my son. A mother's greatest fears come alive in these chapters and at some points I could not believe I was reading a children's book. While the rest of the story is a little less sad (at least on its apparent side) it works on our deepest fears, mainly loosing a loved one, being alone. These however are my observations as an adult. I am sure my son's perceptions are not similar at all and that as an adult I feel this book in a different level.  I enjoyed reading the other reviewers that describe their memory of reading this book as children. My experience was different, having read this book for the first time slowly, for several weeks, aloud to my son. My feelings are thus those of a grownup and maybe this makes this book even sadder to me (I do not want to plunge into the discussion of should children know how sad the world is - I have no good answer). In any case this is a marvelous adventure book for all ages whose power stems from many aspects. For me it was mainly the candid descriptions of the narrator, Scotty, who regards himself as a coward and who is moved to great acts of courage by his love to Jonathan, his beautiful, brave and kind brother. The love for Jonathan is really Scotty's driving force. The book really belongs to the canon of best children books ever. On the first level this is an adventure book. The good: a beautiful hero, who always seems to know the right words, a fight for freedom, acts of bravery and self-sacrifice. The evil: a cruel leader, always finding new horrible ways of torture, demonic creatures, treachery and deceit. On the second level this fight for freedom is taking place in a mystical world-beyond who has another world-beyond, a notion that is both scary and comforting (there is always where to go but it seems the problems never end). On yet another level I felt the story works on our deepest fears: death, oppression, darkness, monsters, loneliness and separation from your loved ones which are really the most important aspect of life or of living. I am thinking to myself that maybe the message is that death is better if you stay with your loved ones? is this too horrible to think?  The reading therefore can be pleasing, emotional and thought provoking for different ages and is remembered a long while after the reading.  . 
 Some time ago when I started with watercolors I discovered Susan Harrison-Tustain's book "Glorious Garden Flowers in watercolor" (also available here on Amazon). I was blown away, at first by her great paintings and then of course, how she showed and explained, that I could do it, too! She is a great artist and a great teacher, so I was looking forward to get her DVD. This DVD is simply wonderful. You can see, how to paint a wonderful rose in watercolor from beginning to the end, which palettes Susan uses, how to stretch paper. There is an apple-study, another study of a beautiful lily, she shows different backgrounds, how to get a velvet look, how to paint dewdrops, she shows how to paint lost and found edges and so on. You really see, how she paints and she explains every step with a lot of tips. A wonderful thing is also her gallery, where you can see many of her wonderful paintings and there is also a slide show. To look at her gallery and hearing the music on the DVD in the background, you feel as you were in a magic world. This DVD is easy to manage with going from chapter to chapter. Susan Harrison-Tustain loves to share all about watercolor, what she knows. This DVD is a "Must have it", you will learn all, what you want to know about watercolor, and this from one of the best artists, which I know. 
   	"He saw the blueness, almost a ball of energy, the crack-flash of color that came from inside his mind, inside his life, and then he was back and down and saw nothing more." You may never know when there will be a day where your stranded on an Island with know where out, you have yourself and Mother Nature with you, that's it. The River is a book that has to do with survival; Brian Robeson was alone with Mother Nature itself for fifty-four days with a small hatchet from his mother. Luckily Brian overcame the wilderness and survived. The U.S Government has contacted Brian to help teach the military and astronauts to survive the way he did. The only problem is he has to go back and face the wilderness again like he did once before. Derek Holtzer a government psychologist will join Derek and take notes for survival skills during the trip.   	The Government provides Brian and Derek with equipment for the trip. Brain knowing his instincts and survival skills threw all the equipment away except for the radio for emergency uses. Derek agreeing with Brian is struck by lightning one night as well as the radio Brian was holding. Brian healthy and up the following morning is troubled when he finds Derek in a coma and doesn't know what to do since the radio fried up during the storm. Brian doesn't have his hatchet beside him now, he's alone and he has to find help fast.   	Hatchet one of the greatest books of all time has found a rival in my opinion. The River being adventurous and also being the sequel of Hatchet has had many controversies between my sister and me. I believe this book is on my top five greatest books ever read for me because the book delivers tips and strategies for surviving in the wild while keeping a story line thorough to make it interesting. My emotions were highly remarkable; I would go from relaxing and taking time off to read a book to reading vigorously without missing a single word. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars because the suspense of the book is so deep and intense you fall in to the book and feel as if you're experiencing every moment with Brian and Derek. Pick The River as your next book you'll never put it down. 
 Without a doubt "Lives of the Great Composers" is one of the finest biographical books on composers in existence. The information presented is neither too brief nor overly exhaustive; it provides an invaluable source of information whilst keeping extraneous and tedious knowledge to a bare minimum. Each page is as interesting and informative as each other and will always be a great pleasure to read, never a bore 
 I have owned the Forerunner 305 for about 3 weeks.  Mine has performed exactly as advertised.      The GPS rapidly acquires satellites and I have not had a problem with it losing connection.  I live in Hawaii and the GPS had no problem finding satellites (updating the Almanac data) and providing a fix while I sat in my living room on the initial start.  Since then it occasionally seems to take longer to find satellites, but while I input my planned workout it continues to find the satellites and by the time I am done, it is ready to track my progress.      The heart rate monitor has worked perfectly.  It has not once failed to immediately display my HR.  So far it has worked better than my Polar dedicated HR monitors.     The display feature allows you to customize different displays with up to four attributes each out of a list over twenty different parameters.  For example, if you want to know how long you have left, how far you have gone, your current heart rate, and sunset while you are exercising you can make a display just for that!  The display illuminates well at night.      I have found the pace information to be very useful and not at all jerky.  Since GPS does not provide speed directly, the 305 like any other receiver calculates speed based on measured position changes over time.  Since those calculations tend to provide pace information that is naturally jerky, the 305 allows you to smooth the data to varying degrees.  It records the raw speed information, but the pace it displays with "high" smoothing is very steady and useful.  I have not tried other pace settings because I am getting useful information.  Bottom line, pace information is useful, but may require you to adjust the settings to your personal preference.     The best part of the 305 is how it effortlessly provides useful summaries of your workouts, tracks lap to lap performance, and allows you to transfer information to a computer.  I did update the software for the watch (firmware), the USB connection, and the computer program so I may have avoided problems that plagued earlier versions.  I was very impressed how fast and easy moving training plans and routes to the watch and historical workout from the watch to the computer.  The entire process took no more than 3 minutes and didn't require any complex setup.  Once your training records are on the computer, they can be displayed on the Garmin software or a number of different third party web based software solutions that provide different analysis tools, workout plans, and trails to explore.  Most of the features available online are free.  Even if you don't use a computer, the watch stores a long history of previous workouts and displays your previous workouts with useful summaries.     In summary, the 305 is a great tool for runners who want to monitor their workouts or keep an accurate record of their training with very little effort! 
 If you like anything 3rd day has ever done, or like them in the least, get this album. It is the best by a mile. It's awesome 
 I picked up this book, after running into my ex-fiance five years after the fact. I have been struggling with gender role issues longer than I care to admit-I turned 50 this year. To my amazement, I learned some things that I can't apply to a male/female relationship at this time (i'm not in one), but is helping with the most difficult relationship I have-with my adopted mother who is my complete opposite. I learned that although she is a career woman, she still has a more traditional mindset than I. If you are a busy person, and you don't get the whole book read, the first three chapters may change your life significantly 
 Treasure Island is one of the several films that the dream team of Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper made together. This one seems to illustrate their relationship off-screen much better than others in the past. Cooper plays the main character, a boy who works in his father's tavern. His life is changed when one day, a sailor called Captain walks in (Lionel Barrymore). His appearance sets off a series of events leading to pirates entering the area, leader of all being Long John Silver (Beery). They come to seek the treasure indicatd on a treasure map the Captain leaves at the tavern when he dies suddenly. However, the map is in the hands of loyal British subjects under the orders of an honest man (Lewis Stone), so the pirates have to resort to trickery to get their way.  What is disturbing about the movie is how evil one man can be to a boy who looks up to him as a friend and as a father-figure. One can only imagine that this was the way Beery really treated Cooper in life, especially from hearing Cooper tell how much he hated his constant co-star. This information makes the film all the more powerful and heartbreaking at times. Otherwise, it is a wonderful adventure story, something that never goes out of style.  Also included on the DVD is the trailer for the film and a few short subjects including an early color short 
 This book is an interesting addition to the story of Easy Company as chronicled in Band of Brothers.  It is the story of one highly literate enlisted man's view of the war.  It lacks the overview of the war in Ambrose's book and is much more cynical.  Before reading it, I would recommend first reading Ambrose's Band of Brothers and Winters' Biggest Brother 
 Supertramp is a great rock group and this is a very fine compilation from them.get this and volume 1 of their hits 
 Roger Baron's book goes to great lengths to cover all the basics having to do with the media planning discipline. This book should be required reading for all entry level media professionalls as well as those considering a career in media planning. Well written, good flow.  Highly recommended 
 I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean.  Aired on September 15, 1961 as the show's third season opener, the episode is a Cold War fantasy appropriately called "Two" about the last two survivors on earth, a man and a woman, after an apocalyptic world war in 2109. Written and directed by TV veteran Montgomery Pittman, the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an American infantryman and she is an invading Russian soldier. Like two feral animals, they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war. He even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him. The reality of their solitary existence, however, gradually dawns on them, especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - "Prekrassnyi" - the Russian word for "lovely".  What really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting. Two years before she twitched her nose on "Bewitched", a brunette Elizabeth Montgomery, looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun, plays the untrusting Russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability. The American is played by perennial tough-guy Charles Bronson, fresh from "The Magnificent Seven". Even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war, he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism. They make an odd couple, but it works splendidly. I also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century. Narrated by Rod Serling in his inimitably halting manner, the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript: "This has been...a love story." This is classic TV 
 I have been reading these mysteries from the very first book, it was a nice change to have the book read to me. The book was well read except for some for the pronunciations of some of the famous and infamous locales. I admit I cringed every time I heard Susan Ericksen say Ghirardelli Square.  The characters have evolved nicely over the years and I highly recommend this book, personally I love the audio cd's during my commute to and from work 
 I agree with the other reviewer--the picture *is* misleading.  Bissell does actually sell the pad/brush combination.  Amazon should strive to make sure the picture does represent the product or give a clearly seen disclaimer.  Conversely, I was not unhappy at all with the product received as I can use the pads a lot more than the brush attachment 
 I bought this book for answers to my title above. It is a slow read, but the book is chock full of info of interest to me. It would be difficult to read it without background knowledge of PA history for the period 1600-1800. I am still enjoying the book as I read it at my leisure.  Aloha,  Ed Conne 
 If you love Jack Johnson, you will love these tracks. Soothing, fun, simple, and mesmerising to listen to. 
 Great CD! I saw him in concert here in Chicago and he did mostly songs from this album. Maybe half ballads & half toe-tappers. I'm new to this type of music but I got hooked fast. I have all the Buena Vista Social Club albums, Ibrahim's is my favorite 
 Part 3 of a movie to rule them all 
 In my past reviews  I applauded Mr. Larson's " Isaac's Storm " , also  his       " Devil In The White City " .   He does go into much detail when he writes but, in his defence , when you finish one of his books there are not questions left unanswered . so, it seems for once I agree with just about every review on here  as well as publishers reviews . If you read one of his books and enjoyed the ride  I can only  suggest you try the rest .  Bravo again Mr. Larson...Brav 
 This is what a memoir should be. The Coldest  Winter does not purport to be a history of the immediate post war countries that she visited but, rather, a story of herself, a frightened young woman with ambitions that she didn't understand and  her struggle to reach up to a higher calling that was driving her.  The writing is exquisite, this is as much about the cold that enveloped Europe that winter as it is about the people or the politics that lurched along uncertainly after the holocaust.  Anyone expecting to read a study of the post war European condition should look for another book.  This a small gem by one of our best writers and a true national treasure.   
   Night Ranger was one of those bands from the '80s who should have been a LOT bigger than they were.  Most fans were introduced to the group with the tune Don't Tell Me You Love Me.  Of course the band become popular with the song Sister Christian.  The problem with Sister was if that was the only tune most fans knew they probably thought Night Ranger was a "pop" band which was not the case.  This band could rock with the best of them.  Night Ranger was one of those few '80s bands who could please the hard rock fans as well as the pop fans.  They are still touring today and if you get the chance check them out.  But before you do pick this up so you can rock with the band all night.  You can still rock in America indeed!! 
 Austin blues legend, drummer Doyle Bramhall returns with a smokin followup to "Bird Nest On The Ground". Although I own both albums, it didn't hit me the first time around, what an influence Doyle's vocals were on his friend Stevie Ray Vaughan. The resemblance is downright spooky. I would imagine that some will assume that it is Doyle who has been influenced. Some of the highlights for me were "I'd Rather Be(Blind,Crippled and Crazy), "Life By The Drop" and "Forty Four". If you add the fact that Doyle II and his sizzling guitar are present most of the time, this is one killer set. If you're a blues rock fan, "Fitchburg Street" is destined to be one of your top ten favorites for 2003. The Bramhalls rock my world 
 Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three.  Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great.  These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade.  That's a good class to be in.  
 I bought this when it came out in paperback, put it aside, forgot I had it and went on to read several later books in the series before I realized there was a gap in the story line.  If you're thinking that this reveals a certain ambivalence towards this long running series by F. Paul Wilson, you would be correct.  The combination of high tech and numinous evil does not always ring true and Jack, the Repairman of the stories, sometimes comes off more like an urban folk tale than a real character.  For the most part these issues are small and the books are always readable.  But there are times when I'm not in a hurry to read them.  Gateways turns out to be one of the best of the late books in this series.  Jack's father, who has retired to Florida, is hospitalized with a severe coma after a mysterious traffic accident.  When Jack comes south to attend his father he discovers suspicious goings on that include weird lights in a swamp and a group of weirdly talented and deformed people who seem to be tied in with the management of the gated community in which Jack's father, Tom, lived.  Anya, Tom's neighbor in the retirement community befriends Jack, but he has a lot of trouble believing what she tells him.  Out in the swamp is a gateway to The Otherness, a place where The Adversary resides awaiting its opportunity to claim the earth.  It is the emanations from this gateway that have warped the denizens of the swamp, human and otherwise.  Jack's father has been marked as a sacrifice in opening the way, and so Jack is catapulted into a struggle with Semelee, the young woman who leads the swamp folk, and who believes that she is the one destined to master the planet.  It doesn't help that she has a 'fatal attraction' for Jack as well.  Jack has encountered the Otherness before, but this time it is not only up close and personal, but it has a face (or two) and a larger part in the story.  Jack's role in all this becomes a bit clearer.  This novel works well, and the change of scene to Florida is a break from the muddled grays of New York City.  If you've been staying away from Wilson, Gateways is an excellent way to get back into the larger story arcs of the series 
 The Sociopath Next Door is a very simplistic portrayal of sociopathy.  It often generalizes far too much, and tries to reduce all sociopaths to  three or four categories.  That being said, it is the only book on sociopathy that I have encountered which actually describes what the average sociopath is like.  In all of the other books on sociopathy and psychopathy which I have read, they mention that most sociopaths are not serial-killers or people who spend most of their life in prison.  They then go on to spend their whole book talking about serial killers and those who spend their lives in prison, as if that is what all sociopaths do.  This book talks about the kind of sociopaths that you would actually encounter in real life:  the ruthless man at the top of the business world, the vengeful psychiatrist, and the utterly lazy dad who displays a complete lack of emotion about important issues.  This book may only at a popular level, it may be too general and too simplistic, but until someone else actually writes a better book dealing with the average sociopath, I will have to recommend that you read this book if you want to know about these sociopaths.  Overall grade:   
 Amazon is selling this at nearly 50% off! The eyepieces are great for a beginner and the great case has room for more when you add them. The filters are really cool. 
 This book is a great overview of all things Shakespeare. It intorduces the man himself, the language of the works, the culture of the Elizabethans and the theatre, sosurces, and basic scholarly criticism and ideas. A wonderful foundational text with primary documents which greatly enhance the reading and give the subject a new life 
 Of all the Tony Hill/Carol Jordon books, this one is my personal favorite. The flirtation between Tony and Carol is at its peak (well, as far as the three books that have been released in the U.S. ....), and one of the two crimes being solved is one that really makes you think...at least it made me think! :)  There were several moments where McDermid's usual dry sense of humur made an appearance; having this exact sort of thing laughable myself I find her style irrisistable.  There is a pretty major surprise at the end of this book, and it is best to have red the two prior books in the series before starting on this one.   Also, a brief warning to future readers: I foud the beginning of The Last Temptation to be confusing and rather boring, so much so that I almost put it down, I'm embarrassed to admit, but I'm very glad I didn't...and you'll be glad you didn't, too 
 Relaxing and inspiring ideas are contained in this lovely little book.  It was very refreshing to see such simple ways to treat yourself or sooth your soul.  I am definitely stocking up to give as bridal shower gifts, etc 
 When you read a story that has love. Plenty of it, mind you, not sex just love in all addressees, is a good reading because you'll understand all kinds of love. Affair love, child's love, offspring's love, animal's love, etc. This book has all of it and you'll understand the four letter word in all its extent. When you read a book with a message, a real good message that's a good one. So this is a good one. 
 Written in 1920 and often regarded as D. H. Lawrence's greatest novel, Women in Love is the complex story of two women and two men who scrutinize their lives and personal needs in an effort to discover something that makes the future worth living.   The personal and social traumas of post-World War I, combined with the rise of industry and urbanization, have affected all four main characters, often at cross purposes as they explore love and its role in their lives.  Intensely introspective and self-conscious, each character shares his/her thoughts with the reader, allowing the reader to participate in the inner conflicts and crises that each faces.  Ursula Brangwen, a teacher in a mining town in the Midlands, is attracted to Rupert Birkin, a school supervisor;  her sister Gudrun, an artist whose sculptures have drawn some attention in London, is drawn to Gerald Crich, whose father is a mine owner.  As the two women earn their living and consider the issue of marriage, which they regard as an impediment to their independence, the men deal with issues of sexuality and power, and whether the love of a woman is enough.  Both men have homosexual urges which compete with their feelings for women.  Gerald is the most conflicted of the four.  Taking over the mines upon the death of his father, he is fiercely committed to making them successful, even if that means hardening his heart toward his workers.  He feels no sense of responsibility toward them, dedicating his efforts toward success and power, an attitude he conveys also toward Gudrun, who finds him self-centered but physically attractive.  Rupert Birkin, who is eventually drawn to Ursula, is often thought to have been modeled on Lawrence himself, and his sensitivity, self-analysis, and feeling that love is not enough--that one must progress beyond love to another plane--display the kind of agonized soul searching done by many other young men of his age following the horrors of the world war.  Extremely complex in its exploration of the period's social and philosophical influences on the characters (who are archetypes of society), the novel is also full of symbolism, with many parallels drawn between love and death, which the characters sometimes prefer to life.  As the love affairs of these four characters play out, filled with complications, disagreements about the meaning of love, questions about love's relation to power and dominance, and the role of sexuality, Lawrence projects the tumult of post-war England as the values of the past yield to newer, more personal goals. n Mary Whipple  
 I like almost anything Dean Cain is in.  This was especially exciting and full of suspense. The ending was truly a surprise.  I highly recommend this movie 
 This is a fun book for Pennsylvania natives who like to stray from the beaten path and learn more about some of the weirder landmarks and tourist attractions across the state. The coverage here is similar in scope and humor to the excellent "Roadside America" book series and website. Non-natives might not be too enthralled by this book, but natives will be surprised by the diversity of people, customs, landscapes, and bizarre attractions that are found across Pennsylvania, even if you travel the state extensively. Some of those small towns can have some real weird things in those nooks and crannies. Just watch out for the many typos in this book, which is interesting because Deleon points out several typos on historical markers and artifacts around the state, especially the misspelling of Pennsylvania on the Liberty Bell 
 This is landmark book, one that has the potential to broaden and, at the same time, focus the study of American quilts. It adds substantially to current knowledge of quilt history, particularly in the under-documented inland South. It also models an analytical approach, what one cultural historian calls "cultural behavior," that expands the study of material history to reveal the complex meanings inherent in artifacts.   It is not a "picture book," although it is richly and thoughtfully illustrated. Over 100 sharp images, 32 of them in well-rendered color, depict the quilts and complement the text.  Nor is it a conventional "quilt book," focusing only on quilt documentation.  It transcends categories and is at once an analysis of sixteen quilts made and preserved by one family over six generations, a superb local history, and a study of a family whose values helped shape a community.  But its focus is the sixteen family quilts preserved by Mary Black and donated to a South Carolina museum. In seeking to discover their meanings as textiles and as personal and cultural documents, the author creates  a world both immediate and immensely interesting.  This is highly readable book. After the first chapter, in which she identifies and illustrates the analytical procedure she used to study the Black family's quilts, Horton avoids the jargon of scholarship and critical theory. This choice and her crisp prose style are seductive: her book reads more like a story of discover than a scholarly analysis. The truth is, it is both.  The epigram, from James Deetz' "In Small Things Forgotten," suggests the writer's mission and method. Deetz writes, "In the seemingly little and insignificant things that accumulate to create a lifetime, the essence of our existence is captured. We must remember these bits and pieces, and we must use them in new and imaginative ways so that a different appreciation for what life is today, and was in the past, can be achieved."  In Laurel Horton's experienced hands, this approach yields bounty. Horton is uniquely equipped for her task. She has studied the same terrain for 25 years. She knows it from personal experience, from her study of the Scots-Irish who formed its backbone, from her study of the quilts of America and the British Isles. Her understanding of the deeply narrative South Carolina upland culture attunes her to stories and signs that point beyond the concrete object and reveal meaning. In fact, the metaphor running throughout this book is that of the scholar as one who "listens" to the voices in the material remains she studies.   Yet it would be mistaken to conclude Horton regards the scholar only as a medium through which the quilts speak. She knows the textiles exist with a series of contexts that can help free their voices and permit the listener to construct valid meaning.  In a culture where women left relatively few documents, however, the quilts remain the writer's primary sources. Horton says she began her research "with a close examination of the quilts themselves, attempting to set aside what I thought I already knew and trying to be receptive to what they could tell me....I have attempted to attend to the quilts and to `listen' to their stories objectively, without rushing to supply answers to my emerging questions."   The result is a fresh and exceptionally well-articulated understanding of a coherent group of quilts. In her effort to identify their meanings, the author opens a world to the reader and in the end, the quilts also become memorable objects in the reader's experience.  Mary Black's Family Quilts is valuable both to the cultural and political historian. It is important to anyone studying the lives of women in America. Certainly it will become part of any complete bibliography of the history and culture of the American South. It is being read in student coffee houses in Spartanburg and readers interested primarily in local or state history have created long waiting lists for it in Carolina public libraries. In short, it is a book for many readers.  One of its more obvious audiences is that of quilt historians, for whom it provides a model and for whom it is also cautionary. Quilts from the inland South have been subject to many unfounded generalizations. A student of textiles and quiltmaking who is keenly attuned to the differences in the cultures and quilts of adjacent counties in Pennsylvania, for instance, often sees the quilts made south of the Mason-Dixon line as a unit.   Studies like Horton's show the danger of such generalization. They remind us of the variety present even in a generally coherent community. The Spartanburg, South Carolina area and the members of the Snoddy and Black families are not offered as microcosms or even representatives of larger groups. Mary Black's Family Quilts focuses on the particular-quilts made by the women in one family in one place and time.  Considering the general lack of scholarly attention so far accorded the quilts of the Deep South and the southern hinterlands, one hopes Horton's work generates the discovery and equally thoughtful study of other groups of quilts in the region.  "Mary Black's Family Quilts" reminds us of the tremendous importance of the concrete detail in the study and communication of meanings in history, the sound or fragrance or scrap of fabric from which explodes a world of meaning. It also reminds us this detail is part of a larger whole. Both in its method and subject, it breaks new ground and will, one hopes, encourage other books that do the same.  For anyone interested in the study of American quilts, women's history, or in the culture and history of the American South, this book is a must-read. 
 This is a collection of Jeeves stories, most set in New York, that also includes the story of how Jeeves came to be hired by Bertie Wooster and Jeeves own account of one of his adventures with Bertie. All is classic Wodehouse and great fun to read 
 It is amazing how Syd's legend is still such a fascinating and thought provoking story. I was stunned way back in the Wake of the Beatles by Pink Floyd and The Piper Recording. I found the music almost shocking and I was really mesmerized by that album. I was so glad to listen again to Syd's solo work and that first cosmic outing while I read this unique book and once again was captured by the sounds, spirit and sadness of a true Rock and Roll genius. A very good read indeed 
 I have practiced interior design for over 20 years and still found this book to be invaluable.  The information about legal ramifications and insurance coverage was enlightening but also sobering.  It's a must read for any design firm principal or freelance designer 
 I just couldn't stop reading this book. The authors writing is very hypnotic, I found my self drifting off while enjoying this book. He tells you the basics to NLP and Hypnosis and tells a bunch of little stories to really help you understand. I love this book, After I finished I decided I would read it all over again. I would have read it again right after I finished if time had permitted it. But I really enjoyed this book and I can't stress it enough, If you are interested in hypnosis or NLP you NEED to READ this book! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! Good Luck fellow minds, In the game of life.. 
 This is an excellent resource for the elementary school teacher.  The activities are teacher friendly, easy to gather materials for, and kids love them.  The content of this book provides a terrific avenue for incorporating outdoor education activities into the school curriculum...likity split 
 Kudos to Mssrs. Schafer & Welsh. CLASSIC AMERICAN STREAMLINERS is worth its price just for the wealth of photographs (the majority in color) of these stylish steel titans of a bygone era! Its more than just a picture  book as the text is also extremely informative.I especially enjoyed  learning where a vintage locomotive wound up after its days on the raills  ended (Scrapheap? Museum?) If you're a train buff, you NEED this book! Not  a train buff? Read this book and you just might become one 
 Edward Gorey is the type of artist who produces very specific reactions from anyone studying his work:  one will either love or hate his artwork and/or stories.  For those of us who are a little off center ourselves, this book is delightful.  His unique drawings remain unmatched to this day, and his tales--well, they are not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination.  Even though I am a staunch Gorey fan, I must admit that there are times when some of the endings leave me quite sad but, just as in life, not every tale has a happy ending.  The book itself is huge, very heavy and filled to the brim with as much Gorey drawings as any fan can desire.  Mr. Gorey deserves more recognition for his unusual but strange depictions of characters whom we don't really know whether to love or hate--a sort of bizarre Alice In Wonderland world of people who run the gamut from the familiar to the insane, and a bestiary of creatures born from the depths of an uncommon imagination.  One has to wonder what a cartoon series based on his drawings and story lines would be like--certainly not Saturday morning fodder.  At any rate, the book is well worth every penny whether you are a fan of Edward Gorey or have just discovered his works and find yourself fascinated by his bizarre view of a world which existed in his extraordinary imagination 
 This little charm of a movie is not just about a generation gap, but about a social and cultural gap.  It's about a spoiled  city boy from Seoul gets to live with his deaf-mute grandmother in the country.  The kid, who's absolutely hateful at first, so much so that one feels one should jump into the movie screen to help the old woman from this demmoic little child,  wants nothing more than to play his electronic Gameboy all day long, ignoring his own grandmother whom he expects to wait on him hand and foot.  (And she dutifully does).  When he's hungry he wants nothing more than pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Choco Pies from town.  Poor Grandma has no idea what "Kentucky Chicken" is.  She sells her own mellons to be able to pay for all the things her grandson wants, sarificing her own needs for those of her grandson.  But then the batteries of the GameBoy die and the kid has no way to restart his game.  Now he learns there is more to life than just superficial electronic games.  He meets other villagers and their children, their crazy animals and their crazy ways.  Although I never felt like the kid truly changed from his visit, the love of the woman to the boy was geniune and heart-warming.  There was little dialogue in this movie.  On a technical note, the instrumental soundtrack was at times overwhelming, in which the music was almost too loud for the rural scenes.  I played this movie in an open dayroom, not expecting anyone to join me.  By the time the movie was over there were five others in the room with me, all saying they really enjoyed the movie 
 I enjoyed reading this book, and being the first Delinsky book that I have read, I picked it up and couldnt put it down. I thought it was a sweet on the side love story mixed with the reality of small town prudeness. I will enjoy reading this book again 
 Of the many books I have read and own on this subject, this one flows the best and is the easiest to read.  That said, this book does not speak to the technical in terms the hows/whys of resources 
 Artists of all skills levels will find CARTOONING, CARICATURE AND ANIMATION MADE EASY a simple presentation of step-by-step cartooning instructions presented by professional Thorndike: the result of a republication of two classics SECRETS OF CARTOONING and ART OF CARTOONING, which appeared in 1936 and 1937, respectively 
 Jane Glover, a well known conductor and Mozart expert does not claim that she has written an original book on her admired and adored composer genius.  She admits: "The Mozart field has been enormously well mined, and for this book I have done no original research". It is a new angle  that she presents on Mozart, looked at through the eyes of the women who brought him up, grew up with him,  loved him and with whom he worked in the world of music.  After reading many books on Mozart this book still gave me a lot of pleasure and a new insight to the life of this likeable genius of music.    The book is divided in to two major parts. The first on Mozart`s life with his two families, the second on the  singers of Mozart`s operas and how the composer created music, blending and integrating the individual talents and capabilities of these singers with his music.  This analysis is highly technical, but never boring and can contribute to the better understanding and enjoyment of Mozart`s music.  The end of this second part tells the reader about the lives of Mozart's women after his death. It is a good ending, satisfying the readers curiosity about how Mozart, the penniless,  ignored and poorly treated composer, at the time of his death, suddenly became the most durable and popular composer, generating a handsome income, that was denied to him in his lifetime, - for his widow and two sons. This, interestingly, had a lot to do with his widow's business talents.  This well written book will bring satisfaction and a new insight on Mozart's life and works, even to those who are familiar with the large Mozart literatur 
 Unfortunatly, this was actually when Garfield books were starting to fall a bit flat on ideas and the 1990's books weren't as good compared to the mid to late 1980's books but this book is still very funny, but overall if you're a Garfield fan, this book is highly recommended 
 These little cutters are great for making bento, but they also get my picky toddler to eat more veggies.  You gotta love that!  I have also used them to cut out maple-leaf shapes from scraps of pie crust dough to decorate pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, too 
 My son was not as enthusiatic about Astronomy as I was, until we watched "My Fantastic Field Trip To The Planets."  Now, he wants to look through our telescope and imagine that all the planetary characters in the video are up in the night sky.  Very cute.  I am impressed that he can now name all the planets and their order from the sun.  He told me that Saturn's rings are made of ice and dust and that Jupiter is the biggest.  The song "93 Million Miles Away" really drives home the fact that the sun is 93 million miles from Earth.  The video is amazingly engaging and effective.  I think it is the best introduction to the planets that you can offer your child 
 This movie from 1985 was the last movie performance of Lucille Ball before her death in 1989. When it was filmed, Ball, who's early drama career became pretty much forgotten because of the name she made for herself in slapstick comedy, stated that she made this film so her public would not just remember her as a dizzy redhead. She wanted to be remembered as an actress who could play virutally any role, and that she could! This in my opinion was her greatest dramatic role. This is not the Lucy America knew as a coniving, scheming redhead who always managed to get into something she had to find a way out of. This is a whole new dimension of Lucille Ball. Grey haired, head lice, dirty, down and out with no social status, her character is a bag lady who has hit the absolute bottom living on the streets of New York City and struggling to survive. An outstanding performance on her part, in this "made for TV" drama. Her rendition of the bag lady Florabelle, will certainly make you stop and think about homelessness. After all, Everyone loves Lucy. When you see someone you have loved for half a century, now aged and homeless, it hits home. In addition to Lucy, Daphne Zuniga also gives a shining performance as the young social worker who sets out to get Florabelle off the streets and into a home of her own to live out what remaining years she has. The problem is that Florabelle has been on the streets for years and knows no other way of life. You will be enthrolled as you watch to see how it will all end. Very good quality all the way around. If you are a diehard Lucy fan, You HAVE to see this movie. If it's not in your Lucy collection, you don't have one. I highly recommend this film........ 
 	"He's very nervous when it comes to meeting new people.  That's why he's still alive."  In The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray, by Chris Wooding, Prussian bombings and the revolution of science have turned London into a city of terror.  With the sudden appearance of supernatural, malevolent creatures called wych-kin, new advancements attempt to keep the city safe.  Wych-hunters, like the acclaimed Thaniel Fox, prowl the streets of this strange Victorian London at night to control the damage done by wych-kin.  The action begins when Thaniel, a seventeen-year old boy searching for answers, stumbles across a lost, possessed girl on his nightly wych-hunt and decides to bring her in.  Much to his surprise, the girl, Alaizabel Cray, holds inside her an ancient evil that could end up destroying them all.  Surrounded by the brilliant minds of beggars and occultists alike, Thaniel must try to rid London of a growing evil force.       	This compelling horror/science-fiction novel is a fast read, and the themes of the book are very gripping.  Even though it goes by quickly, the ending of the story will leave you thinking and questioning the truths of humanity. Although The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray contains very realistically formed creatures, it is far from a fantasy novel. The wych-kin are always out to kill, and the descriptions of certain characters and what they are capable of doing are far from anything you would consciously imagine.  Wooding's complex and realistic details add to the horror elements.  Through the book, he tells the story as if it actually happened and does not spare the reader from harsh realism.  If you enjoy gripping horror novels that come face to face with the supernatural, you will love The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray because it is frightening and exciting with a slight variation of the classic good versus evil battle.  The book is very similar to The Shade's Children, by Garth Nix because it stays both action-packed and emotional.  However, it is different from other novels of this genre since a lot of the focus remains on the characters and how each is affected by the toll of evil.  If you enjoy a classic horror story twisted with fantastical elements, you need to read The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray.   
 This is not a "fans only" disk.  It's an outstanding introduction to Iggy produced by Don Gallucci, the same fellow who was behind Louie Louie by The Kingsmen.  Like that record, it's loose, loud, fun and very addictive.  Actually, if you've never heard an Iggy Pop album, but you really appreciate rock and roll, start right here.  Get it NOW.  This music was the bridge between garage and punk.  Tight playing, short songs, killer guitar riffs and a "Do it Yourself" ethic were all at work here.  Screw the image, screw the coroporations, let's have some fun and stop trying to save the world.  As Iggy stated in his 2005 interview with Teri Gross on NPR's Fresh Air, it was obvious that the whole "hippie" acid-rock movement was failing to deliver the goods in terms of social change.  18-minute drum solos and noodling keyboard gymnastics weren't going to cure hunger, materialism or militarism.  The message from Iggy and company was clear:  We're not into rock opera, we just came to play.  There's more than one reason that this is called Fun House.  To me, it's a fun record and it was clear that they didn't take themselves so seriously.  The music here works whether just listening alone or in party mode, and is more consistent that what came in later releases as Iggy descended into the drug addiction from which he has thankfully since recovered.  BTW:  The reviewer who complained about the remixed version of Raw Power got it wrong.  The 1990s remix was authorized by Iggy Pop and was definitely needed due to the fact that David Bowie was skeeezed out of his mind during the original mixing of Raw Power, ruining it.  Also, it was taking forever to complete, and no one at Columbia knew what the hell an Iggy Pop record was SUPPOSED to sound like, so they just released it.  But I digress

 Santa Barbara Style is a must have for anyone who has ever had the opportunity to visit this gorgeous city. It is a wonderful reminder of the beauty and serenity that Santa Barbara has become famous for.   Sven Klein - Santa Barbara, CA   
 I am a child neurodevelopment specialist and am seeing this book from the 1970's fulfill itself in the 1990's.  I recommend this book even if you don't suspect ADD/ADHD.  I even make copies available at all my seminars on  child development. Unsuspecting parents and prospective parents also need  this information to be properly armed with defense in our neurotoxic  society that is driven to delights for the palete while being sold toxic  foods at less cost than healthy foods 
 This is a great CD, very mellow and relaxing.  It would be really great in the summer time when the weather is warm and sunny.  It definitly inspires a margarita and a tan.  I bought this CD shortly after my daughter was born and it's one of the few things that calm her and put her to sleep (she's got great taste in music at only 2 months old!).  Unfortunatly, this album was much better before I was listening to it 4-5 times a day 
 I am not sure that I have the full measure of this, but it was an entertaining read. Highly allusive, I can imagine it could irritate anyone whose knowledge didn't match up with Markson's to any degree 
 I absolutely love these potholders!!!! I have four sets of them. They are great as potholders but they also have other uses. I place them under cutting boards to keep them from sliding on the counter when I am chopping. I also use them to keep bowls firmly on the counter if I am whipping cream. I also use them as trivets when placing hot pans on my counter top.   My only caution regarding this product is that you need to be aware of the location of the hole in one corner of the potholder. I didn't pay attention one day and got a nasty burn pulling a very hot pan out of the oven. If you are a bit of a klutz, like me, best to keep 100% aloe in the house just in case you do what I did. Repeated applications of aloe took the burn out of the fingertip in a few hours. I was very fortunate. I hope this doesn't happen to you.   I highly recommend this product 
 Easy and fast to use. Well constructed. No more glass chips with this baby. Lots of accessories included. Luv it 
 Terrific book which finally made it clear to me why I had been ground into the dust refitting an older boat; namely, the enormous number of jobs and the huge amount of labour required to refit a 20 year old boat, even if in moderately good condition.   Table 4-5, page 117, lists desired upgrades for three styles of offshore voyagers - simplicity, moderation and highlife. Their costs and labour are shown in detail in Chapter 10, Putting it All Together From Refit Plan to Balanced Boat, pages 248-266.   There is also a real world FOUR YEAR refit example and information on what was left off going from Leonard's Silk to Hawk.   This is NOT in the first edition, which for me makes the second edition the only choice.  This book is as necessary as Hal Roth's How to Sail Around the World and Nigel Calder's Mechanical and Electrical Manual and Cruising Handboo 
 If you want to talk about 'truth in advertising,' it'd be this book! It amazes me that some people approach the book expecting some kind of "fair and balanced" journey through Catholic history when the book's title baldly and plainly proclaims its author's ideology from the outset.  All that aside, Crocker writes with a palpable love of the triumphant side of Catholic history. The book is not definitive, and certainly does not claim to be. However, just as "A People's History of the United States" and "A Patriot's History of the United States" are both polemical, yet valid, so too is "Triumph" a skewed, but nonetheless valid and important, point of view. The volume is essentially for Roman Catholics who want to celebrate their faith's rich heritage, although it holds a good deal of interest for tolerant people of all kinds, Christian or not.  The book tends to gloss over Roman Catholic failings, especially when discussing the Renaissance popes and the imperialistic papacies of Innocent III and Boniface VIII. Crocker's treatment of the Reformation in particular is devastatingly biting with regards to Protestantism, and no enemy of Catholicism will enjoy his treatment of the non-Catholic Christian communions. Crocker's historical research, however, is impeccable (though colored throughout by his INTERPRETATION of those historical events).  Nevertheless, Crocker's book is exactly what he and those who reviewed it claim it is: a vigorous, pro-Catholic journey through the history of Christianity's oldest church, and while you may not agree with everything (or anything) he says, there's no doubt that he makes the ride a very enjoyable, and even side-splittingly funny, experience 
 If I had to choose one conductor to compile exerpts from the greatest masses and works in choral literature and history, I would only bestow that duty to Robert Shaw and his choruses.  Once again he displays his uncanny  ability to not only choose beautiful music but also perform it in a  spellbinding manner.  Even with the pieces the average listener has heard  or performed, such as Vivaldi's Gloria or portions of Handel's Messiah, one  cannot help but become enthralled with the recordings of Shaw's  interpretations of those works.  Although Shaw never followed through on  his early-life ambition to be a minister, I still believe he does so and  perhaps to a greater extent through his music ministry.  One cannot help  but feel closer to understanding what heaven is about after having finished  listening to this CD.  This is well worth buying for it will live up to the  english interpretation of its Latin title: Glorious 
 I like all of Beevor's books I've read so far, and this one is no exception.  My only real criticism is that he has a nasty habit of quoting people in their native tongue (French in this case) without translation, which I found very annoying.  Besides that, I thought the subject was brilliant and presented well.  What I took away from this book is that the French, perhaps more so that other European nations, were a series of paradoxes both during and after the German occupation; simultaneously collaborators and resistants, arch-conservatives and communists, openly hostile to and embracing the influx of American culture.  No one term can be used to pigeonhole them 
 This is THE book that started me on the road to becoming a United States Memory Champion. The book is very well laid out, explains the systems clearly, and your improvement in memory is immediate

 If you love sailing, the sea - or anything vaguely nautical, this is a fantastic book to have around. The author is obviously someone who really loves photography, sailing and the sea - and it shows.   There are over a hundred large  beautiful color images covering boats, boat races such as the Americas cup as well as some fantastic scenery shots only reachable via water.   However, if you really want to get an idea of the type and quality of the photographs in this book, it is well worth visiting the author's gallery (vanderwal.com) rather than simply trusting my written review

 Picked up this book browsing at the recent publications table  at the Society for Architectural Historians of Australia & New Zealand conference, and ended up late for the next session of papers!  Despite its rather drab cover, it achieves just what editor Keith Eggener sets out to do - assembling essays of 'significant scholarship...that are concise, lively, accessible and engaging.'  The ambitious breadth of topics doesn't in any way  compromise the rigour of the selection, and there is a great mix of familiar writers and new ones (at least for those of us in the Antopides who struggle to keep up with what's going on on the rest of the world).  Liked very much Eggener's previous book on Luis Barragan and the introductory essay displays his characteristic clarity and umnpretentious scholarship.  Favourite essay so far? Difficult to pick between the old friend of Alice Friedman's  'People who live in glass houses' and a new one to me, though quite old, Neil Levine, writing about Venturi. An elegant and generous book 
 Thank God that someone is able to stand up in this nation and address the problems that are facing African American people.  It is a shame that AA people cannot face the truth about their plights.  I too was once a welfare mother.  I did not abuse or misuse the welfare system but I did find that I was growing lazy after a period of time.  Most of my problem was a lack of confidence and a personal embarassment to have to receive a hand-out (even temporarily) from the government, especially when I knew I was a working person.  But bad things do happen to good people--even loss of employment.  The one thing I did discover though, was that I didn't have to keep receiving a government handout.  When I realized what my situation was doing to my daughter--and with the help of the Lord--I pulled myself up and out.  I took advantage of the many services that were offered to me to help me regain my self-esteem, my confidence, and my since of self-worth as a person, and went back to work (these are "some" of the things that being on welfare will help to strip you of).  I was so very glad when welfare was no longer a part of my life.    Welfare is no life at all.  You always have somebody breathing down your neck, in your business because they feel they have a right to be, and controlling what you do, what you have and what you get.  I have been off of welfare for a number of years now and I'm very happy about it.  I applaud Miss Parker for telling her story, and telling it truthfully and honestly.  Welfare--and any government handout that enslaves a person--is not the answer for any people.  It is only supposed to be a temporary means of assistance until a person can get back on their feet, regroup, and get back to being independent and self-sufficient again.  There is absolutely no advancement of life, no change of life, no improving the qualilty of one's life, on welfare.  I truly believe it was never designed to be.    To all the liberals (especially some Democrats) who believe big government and government handouts is the answer to help impoverished, disenfranchised people, my word to you is you are wrong, dead wrong.  All you want to do is keep yourselves in the spotlight as the "poor people's self-proclaimed saviors" when all you're doing is keeping poor people poor and enslaved.  You are promoters and proponents of poverty, hatred and racism.  Why?  Because it brings you fame and the people look up to you all as some sort of god.  Many of you are nothing more than pimps, as Miss Parker's first book states ("Pimps, Whores and Welfare Brats"), and glorified opportunists.  You act as if you've come to help when you've really come to get media coverage and fame for your own selfish agendas, at the expense of a very needy, less-fortunate group of people.  May God have mercy on your souls.    Thank you, Miss Parker, for your candor and truth.  Keep speaking out to a people who need to hear what you have to say.  Hopefully, enough will hear and heed, and seek to make the necessary changes in their lives--for themselves and their children.  I pray for the cycle of poverty and welfare to be broken off the people of this nation--especially African American people.  
 As a high school teacher I am always looking for a book that will speak to the heart and soul of the teen years. This is one such book. Written in the persona of a 14 year old girl, the book has pathos, humor and hope. The characters are believable, lovable and their mistakes are understandable. The minute my students opened the book, boys and girls, they were caught. So was I! There is so much to this unusually written book, that I am only sorry I started it so near the end of the school year. It is a treasure that can remind all of us what to do when we 'get lemons.' 
 Moving collection of real life stories that make you appreciate Hellman's plays. A must read for anyone interested in her relationship with Dashielle Hammett, who penned some of the, if not, Thee best crime novels in American literature. Read his works first, then read this, then read Hellman's plays. You'll feel as though you've spent time with them over a life. (Lillian has 2 further books of memoirs to complete her trilogy.) Her and Dashielle were 2 of the clearest examples of the cliched hard drinking writer of the 20th century. 
 Based on a true story, this motion picture is a fresh original production. Leo does an awesome job portraying a very elusive character. One of the finest performances I've seen from Dicaprio and Tom Hanks. These two work well together. I'd like to see more. Very good quality production, well written screenplay, excellent casting and very few things I dislike about it. Could have been given a little more spunk in the plot, but not at all a bad film. I highly recommend it 
 Four stars might be a little much. But, I really like Cases' style. He has written a handfull of books that all have a strain of very nicely pieced together passages. Only in previous books that I have read by Case, the passages don't hold up as a whole.   Here in the Eighth Day the book has huge swaths of very readable and enjoyable aspects that do manage to grab your lapels and reel you along for a nice ride. I personally can't wait for Case's future novels and hope that he continues to mature along the arc that is very noticable from one book to the next. The 'Eighth Day' is not close to being a great book. It is corney and the ending is what you would expect from any mainstream writer or hollywood film. I mean, come on... get a little original here and take a couple of chances.   A lot of authors have had novels that revolve around the protagonist being hunted down. Grisham, Ludlum, Coben... on and on. Other than the Bourne Supremecy by Ludlum, it's difficult to think of one that just doesn't go way over the top, where the world isn't hanging in the balance, or the protagonist is a fish out of water and fighting against impossible odds. The 'Eighth Day' straddles this implausible strain that runs through the 'chase' genre. The best components of the novel are where the protagonist is confronting small problems that an ordinary person might concievably confront.   If you get this book, I don't think that you will despise your decision. Just keep in mind that it is not yet up to Case's potential.  You might try Harlan Coban's books that don't have the character Myron Bolitar in them. They are very good thrill rides. 
 This is the gem of the Wayne/Ford Calvary trilogy, and I am delighted it's finally coming to DVD.  But a question: Can anyone heal me of the following misjudgment?  Try as I may, I cannot shake off my estimation of Fort Apache as a more complete and substantially higher overall cinematic accomplishment in comparison with The Searchers.   Partly it may consist in the fact that The Searchers is a great movie to watch -- and watch again -- but Fort Apache somehow succeeds as a more nearly perfect, complete and wholly rounded experience. The Searchers shines due to its externals, but Apache proceeds and then later culminates in a richer, deeper and more satisfying way, and the whole movie experience resonates with you in a way that The Searchers does not quite achieve 
 I found the reviews of Drummer Hoff to be very interesting, particularly the parts about what this book meant to my fellow readers in their youth.  My take is a little different however.  As a mom with two young children (38 months and almost 5) I am constantly looking for books of all sorts to read to them.  I particularly like books that my kids love enough to memorize on their own.  In this light, Drummer Hoff is a complete hit.  The drawings are so intense and interesting that my son brings the book to me all the time... or did.  Now that we all know it by heart we take turns reciting it as we play on the lawn.    And while it is true, as some have noted, that it does not have an obvious beginning, middle, and end, it does still tell a story.  And this book serves its purpose the same way many of the old rhymes do.  It teaches diction, vocabulary and memory skills:  all of which are early reading aids.    This mom and dad give it 5 stars 
 Beebo Brinker is a one of the best of the lesbian pulp fiction novels from the 1950s, and is here reprinted in all its original steamy charm and vivacious energy. Sensual, with a timeless insight into love, lust, and relationship conflicts between women, Beebo Brinker is an enduring title as erotic and compelling today as it was when its was originally published some fifty years ago 
 Very comfortable.  Better quality than most.  Good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside.  Sizing appears to right on for me.  I take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right.  The laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe.  I doubt they will last very long outside, but who wears slippers to the store??  Highly recommended!  
 I definitely agree with the previous reviewers that this test is easy to use, self-contained, has very clear instructions, etc. I'll also add that the support is GREAT. They have a nurse practitioner there to take your questions if you have them and they have operators that help out with any other questions. I've had nothing but great experience with this test, and it's been helping me monitor my TSH levels as I come OFF of Synthroid through use of Acupuncture and Herbs. I highly recommend this product!! 
 I am a student majoring in middle grades education.  I read this book for an assignment.  I enjoyed the author's writing style and Lisa Delpit's foreword. The book has plenty of helpful and educational information to  consider when teaching black students. It also gives explainations for why  some black students are doing so poorly in integrated schools. This book is  great for any teacher who is interested in multicultural education 
 Whitmont's writing can be a bit obscure at times.  However, he succeeds in presenting us with a wealth of information, descriptions, and his view of the role of the goddess archetype in human conciousness.  The work, according to Whitmont, the work that will get us out of the "wasteland" of our times, is to reclaim the fountain and the mermaids that sing in it.  His description of the Grail myth (especially its use by Hitler and the Nazis) is, in my opinion, an absolute requirement for all those who have heard the "What ails you?" call 
 In this book we find a different Waugh, without his acustomed piercing humour. Two biographies, one of a saint and martyr an the other of a converted priest and scholar. It's very practical finding both works together in a single volume. Campion'life is a masterpiece of hagiography. In this kind of work it's common the lacking of literary excellence. Here we have a deep investigation offered to us in the best style. The life of Ronnie Knox -in spite of some observations we can find in Christopher Syke's biography of Waugh, very interesting in fact- we can living with him, and we cannot not loving him. We are obliged to think a lot about our own spiritual life and about the problems of catholic culture in last cantury 
 Sharon McCone is back in the 23rd series novel by Marcia Muller. McCone's detective agency has grown and life looks good, until good fortune takes a dive.   Julia Rafael, one of the more interesting characters Muller has introduced in this series, takes center stage as she is arrested for credit-card fraud. Rafael is near the completion of her investigator apprenticeship under McCone's leadership, and a former client from a case Rafael worked accuses her of stealing his credit card.   The client in question is Alex Aguilar, an up and coming political figure in the San Francisco area, who became popular for his goodwill project to provide job training to the out-of-work.   Rafael's less than above-board past and smart-aleck mouth and attitude leave her friends and employer wondering, did she do it? And when some packages bearing Rafael's name are delivered to the mailroom beneath the detective agency, McCone is forced to consider the possibility that they've all been conned.   In one crashing moment, McCone's agency is in danger of being fined and ultimately closed down. Who better to investigate the case than McCone herself, who has the most at stake?   She could use her long-time lover, Hy Ripinsky's help and support, but by calling him, she must answer his marriage proposal. But she doesn't know what her answer will be and prefers not to explore her resistance too deeply.   A visit to Aguilar's neighbors reveals that the man has a very different faade than the one publicly seen. He's a rather angry, rude, obnoxious man and he recently had a known felon as a house guest.   But all leads lead to nowhere and the stakes continue to rise as bodies start dropping and McCone's nephew is shot at; then Julia Rafael is critically wounded.   Cryptic messages are targeted at McCone and they hold the key to the shooter. But will they clear Julia's name?   Continuing a series runs the risk of repeated storylines, but Muller has not succumbed to this common pitfall. Kudos to Muller for escaping that trap. 
 I can't really say enough good things about this book.  No, it's not perfect, but it's heaps better than most of the books on weight training.  This focuses specifically on safety and technique, not on routines or dieting.  The author is currently putting out a new book with revised directions from this book and all the training/dieting info in one handy package.  I can't wait to get it.  A bit expensive but I'd rather spend forty bucks on reliable, one-volume info than waste my time and money on countless less helpful books and magazines.  Helpful photos, not only of good form but also common mistakes to avoid. Clear explanations, almost excessive pointers about what do keep in mind as you do each exercise.  The author is super-orthodox about safety and form, which may put off a lot of young guys, but if you've had a single back injury you will really appreciate his point of view.  It's the type of thing that you don't want to think about until you've been there and suffered 
 Overall this book is full of very nice pictures and data. However, I have noticed some glitches in this book as following:  - The publisher could has used better photos for some tanks especially Tiger I and Tiger II tank. Tiger II photo in the book is the limited production version utilized by the German in the war. The photo in this book is the "Porsche Turret" which was one of the two proposed designs. The Porsche design was not selected for mass production (only 50 produced). It would be more appropiate to use photo of Tiger II with "Production Turret" designed by Henschel in this book.  - The book did not mention about the world first assault rifle Sturmgewehr (STG) 44 while the much respected machine pistol MP40 has only limited descriptions. The STG 44 and MP 40 should have enjoyed the same context as the Thompson sub-machine gun.  However stunning layouts and pictures compensate these glitches. For those who are interested in WWII, this book is absolutely highly recommended 
 Jim Phillips trusted Ken Tysiac to help him tell his life story, and the trust was well-placed. Although Phillips has passed away, you can hear his voice again in this well-organized, fast-paced book. If a book can feel like a football Saturday afternoon in the fall, this one does. All Clemson fans will get a big kick out of it 
 Love the cd.. I am a Huge Journey and Steve Perry fan. This shows how great and why Journey is still the best band. Why are there no more good bands left. Miss Them 
 This is really a cute book and I know my niece will really enjoy it. I recommend buying and reading it to all children.  It is truly fun 
 In this series, Dyer's focuses on the power of manifesting what you desire.  To him, there's a lot of truth that if you ask and believe in something you shall get it.  Of course, this goes against the logic of the age but some things can't be quantified, can they?  The audio series is very much about washing the garbage out of your head and moving forward with more inspiration.  Real life examples are given as proof and it's up to the listener to deciee whether they believe or do not believe it 
 Great book.  Tommy writes just like he talks.  If you like Tommy Lee, you'll love this book 
 This item is wonderful.  We bought this item for our trailer and have not had a chance to use it.  We do have other calphalon pans that are great. 
 In a precise way, author covers three major Keys to better health:  A) Foods. B) Exercise. C) Nutrients.   Drawn from many years of practice as a physician, Dr. Sears explains the very core of each food groups, nutrients and excercise techniques in very simple and logical terms. Time-tested and very effective extensive lists of Foods and Nutrients provided can practically be used not only to achieve a healthier heart but also to prevent Diabetes and many degenerative diseases such as Arthritis, Alzheimer dementia, Osteoporosis.  The effective exercise techniques shown in the book  is a real time and life saver for anyone interested in effective workout routines.   A must read for anyone with hypertension, heart disease or for anyone looking for a heathier, sensible diet and exercise plan or for any one, for that matter, interested in healthy-living lifestyle.   The book itself is a very pleasant read, much of which is very reassuring and remarkably lucid writing structure coming from a professor of anatomy, human physiology, and nutrition and a Board Certified Physician in Anti-Aging Medicine. Looking forward to Author's future books.       -The TreeClub Review Team 
 This is an epic novel about the horrors of slavery as an institution and as a destructive element to the body, soul, family and faith of the individual being held bound.    It has been said that Abraham Lincoln once met Harriet Beecher Stowe and said:  "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war."   After reading this book, I believe "Uncle Tom's Cabin" did more than nudge this great nation into taking action against such an inhumane institution.  This book should be mandatory reading for all children in our great public schools.  But, alas, we no longer have the guts to teach our children the truths and the horrors so well described in this book.      
 I usually never take the time to write reviews for films, but I made an exception for this classic trash masterpiece. This movie came to my attention from an ad for it in the October edition of Rue Morgue magazine. Exploitation is my genre, so this movie looked to be right up my alley. Man!!! I am so glad I took the chance on this movie. I thought i've seen it all, but this movie played like a lost gem. I never heard of the Zero Woman series nor did I know that there was a Japanese exploitation sub-genre. It seems like the producer/ director were trying to copy the raw blaxploitation action formula that was popular from the early to mid 70's. The Zero woman character is as cold blooded as Rick James. This movie has it all. To Zero Woman's red handcuffs that work as zany as the "Master of the Flying Guillitines" weapon. One guy takes a gun shot to the nuts and dudes balls blow up big time. The villians are very colorful and also stupid which is always fun. One of the japanese villians in particular is funny as hell to watch. My man is dressed up to look american and is also shot so you cant really make out his eyes. It's so obvious it stands out. Dude is dressed up in a matching jean jacket outfit with a red bandanna, a train conductor hat and some big ass Burt Reynolds mirrored sunglasses. Everything is so over the top in this movie it just knocked me flat out on my ass. I bet Tarantino probably owns this DVD. The movie is that cool. Discoteck's transfer is great and their packaging is slick, especially with the inner sleeve picture of the video cassette cover. Even though this disc has no extras, it's more than worth it for this film. Besides you buy these dvd's for the movie anyway. As Prince says in the song "Gett Off", "I guarantee that you won't be bored". Keep rockin those roller skates Discotek. 
 With great verve, Tom Holland brings long past history to life in this retelling of the first epic clash between east and west. The long-forgotten Persian Empire is given some deserved attention, and the winding histories of both Sparta and Athens are recalled in amusing fashion. (A few of Holland's points are necessarily speculation, but he makes this clear in his fine footnotes.) The unlikely story of how a few Greek city states in a backwater corner of the globe were able to turn back the largest, most glittering invasion force history had ever seen remains vital and thrilling. It also has contemporary relevance, as Holland astutely points out. My only quibble with this book is: for Pete's sake, do you mean to say that neither this erudite author nor his editor know what a sentence *fragment* is? The book is littered with them. See for example the beginnings of many paragraphs in the chapter on Athens; my wording isn't exact but they tend to read something like: "A point which was driven home with great force." This is not, you will note, a complete sentence, though it is passed off here as if it were one. I can't believe such an otherwise well-written book is so often marred in this fashion. But, anyway, I do recommend the book 
 Their music is great and I love the sound, but they are a studio group only.  Their concerts are really poor.  They don't play all of their hit songs, their live mix is slightly off, they don't bring a large enough supporting band and they don't relate well to the audience at all.  The biggest issue I had with them in concert (Pacific Amphitheater, CA  July 2006) was their song selections.  They chose to play songs that they liked and not songs that the crowd wanted to hear.  They left out some big hits songs to play some other songs that were really pretty bad.  Which was a surprise to me as I love their music.  I give them an "A" for their music and an "F" for their concert 
 Communism used to have footholds everywhere, and the KGP was the true puppet master.  However the KGBs rivals included other deviant forms of communism, heresies if you will, such as China, Albania and Yugoslavia.  China tried to penetrate Africa in the 1970s, bankrolling revolutions and dictatorships, Cuba was also deeply involved in Angola(to the tune of 30,000 troops) and in Ethiopia.  Russia had a toehold in Vietnam, but China was weary of the Vietnamese attempt to overrun Laos and Cambodia in 1975.  In South America different strains of communism helped lead to the death of Che Guevara.  The war in central America was about Communism and the KGB infiltrated the governments of the Middle east. Khrushchev was the orginal architect of the turn to the third world, realziing that even reactionary third world dictators could be courted through money to help fight America.  It was the opposite of the Stalin policty of viewing everyone as the enemy who was not proclaiming friendship.  This excellent book looks at the KGB's role in africa though newly declassified documents and access to other hitherto unpublished files.  We see many funny apsects of the KGBs role and learn many new things about the extent of the penetration.  A fascinating book.    Seth J. Frantzma 
 This book was mind expanding, and told a great story of exploring the facets of one's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others. My favorite part was the story of the "Golden Pages" where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery, but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm, if not war 
 If the author had put the english equivilent in parentheses next to the Greek terms, (even the transliteration would have helped) I would have given it 5 stars. It is however,  still an informative and interesting read.  But, a person who is not familiar with NT Greek will most likely get bogged down in some of the later chapters.  Really a shame though, because it would not have taken much to make it reader friendly.  The premise is simple.  Paul wrote Corinthians in response to the the practice of sophistry which had permetated the church at Corinth.  When seen in that light, many of the passages previously obscured become clear.  (If you are not familiar with the first sophists or the terms concerning Greek rhetoric you may want to read "Retrieving the Ancients, an Introduction to Greek Philosophy" as a preamble. I'm sure there are other introductory  books out there as well.) A glossary on the basic terms of Greek rhetoric would have been immensely helpful, but unfortunately none was provided. Obviously the intended audience was  academicians. A shame really, because with a few alterations it could reach a much wider audience.   Part of the sophistic tradition was that the sophist teachers would gather around themselves disciples and then begin contending vigorously with other sophists--- Does the "I am of Paul, I am of Apollos" ring a bell now?"  A very good scholarly explanation and exegesis of the Corinthian letters.    
 Wahoo!   Nashville really needs to start putting out more reissues that are as good as this one!  Wagoner was the last of the unreformable hicks, gloriously corny, yet country to the bone.  This disc covers a lot of his best material, including the absurdly maudlin recitations such as "Skid Row Joe" and "What Would You Do If Jesus Came To Your House?"  People eat those novelty tracks up with a spoon, but you should also check out his awesome weepers, such as "I'll Go Down Swinging" and "Satisfied Mind."  One of the best CDs in this series -- highly recommended

 I read this book years ago when I was in elementary school, but now, nearly 40, I decided to relax while listening to the audio book.  I sat at the kitchen table, assembling a jigsaw puzzle while the narrator once again described a young boy so desperate for hunting hounds that he saved for two years, and by the time he walked the 30 miles to pick up his hard-earned hounds, his feet scratched from picking berries to sell for 10 or 15 cents a batch to raise the incredibly high goal of $50 for his precious dogs.   This story is such a great tale of true grit, determination, hard work and the idea that all things are possible if you set yourself to the task.  The things the boy learned and experienced with his hounds and his own sense of loyalty to his family and his dogs are the kind of character building stories that every child, and every 40-year-old should experience.  I confess I've always admired dogs ... their loyalty, dedication and wish I could emulate the character that a good dog naturally exhibits.  This is one of a group of stories like Lassie and Ol' Yeller about dedicated dogs.  Buy it for every child that you hope will develop true grit 
 THIS BOOK WAS PUT TOGETHER WELL A LOT OF RESEARCH WENT INTO IT  IT'S SO SAD TO THINK THAT THIS GOES ON THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY  AND NO ONE CAN SEEM TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO HELP VICTIMS OF   DOMESTIC AND A BETTER WAY TO PUNISH THE PEOPLE THAT DO I 
 Book 1 of the "Martyr's Song" series reminded me of John Grisham, book 2 of Francine Rivers, but book 3 reminded me of Robert Ludlum. With fast-paced action you'd expect from a Robert Ludlum thriller, it's a suspenseful page-turner about a terrorist threat to America because of a nuclear bomb and about a CIA operative Casius who acts outside orders.  The story begins with two lovers, Tanya Vandervan and Shannon Richterson on a plantation in Venezuela. They are separated and both of their parents killed when the plantation is brutally attacked by drug-runners wanting to claim the territory as their own.  Believing each other to be dead, Tanya tries to overcome her past by becoming Sherry Blake, a medical student, whereas Shannon falls under the influence of the dark powers behind the witch-doctor Sula and becomes Casius, a hired assassin for the CIA.  Eight years later, their paths cross again in Venezuela, this time with global history at stake due to the terrorist threat.    The theology underlies the plot to a lesser degree than the other two novels in the series.  For the most part this is a typical Robert Ludlum style read, minus the moral garbage, but with a killer on the loose, taking down villains, and a count-down for a nuclear explosion.  But the theology is there, because Dekker wants us to see God's hand acting behind the events that ensue.  Several times, Dekker portrays the unfolding events as moves in a chessmatch where God Himself is playing against the forces of evil.  "God's playing his pieces in this chess match ... They've been moving and countermoving for decades up there on this one." The chess match imagery returns throughout the novel.  "We know who the players are.  They are God and they are the forces of darkness.  The white side and the black side."  Dekker wants us to realize that God is in control behind the decisions of mankind: "he moves the match."   Shannon has embraced the side of evil and wants nothing else than to take revenge.  But his actions could place the future of the United States in jeopardy.  Evil can only be stopped and Shannon changed by Tanya's love for him.  Here Dekker shows how all the events are worked together by God.  Shannon asks: "You can't expect me to believe you were drawn to the jungle to save mankind from some diabolical plot to detonate a nuclear weapon on US soil.  You don't find that just a bit fantastic?"  Dekker wants us to realize that "nothing is without a purpose", and that God is governing all things in "God's chess match," and this is why Shannon and Tanya have been brought together in love.  Tanya's  love plays a role in God's large plan:  "And if I hadn't loved you, the bomb would have gone off.  If my parents hadn't come to the jungle, or if we hadn't fallen in love, or if Abdullah had chosen a different location, the bomb would have gone off.  It was all God's leading, his turning evil to good."  It's divine chess: "The Creator is the ultimate chess master, isn't he?  Why he allows evil to wreak havoc, we can hardly understand.  But in the end, it always plays into his hands."  Ultimately Dekker wants us to marvel at the chessmaster: "God is quite brilliant, don't you think?"   To properly understand the role that love plays in this cosmic chess game, one needs to read Vol. 2 of the series, because there Dekker more fully works out his understanding of true love as requiring a willingness to die to the self and one's own desires, in a Christlike sacrifice.   In the end, the theological underpinning isn't entirely successful: 1. Dekker emphasizes again and again that Tanya was made to love Shannon, but only until the final climax does it become somewhat clear how her final act of loving really does make a difference.  This is the hinge on which the whole chess match depends, yet there was still some cloud over *why* and *how* Tanya's love for Shannon changed the outcome. I found the main premise a little too hard to swallow.  It's true that God uses our moves and decisions as part of his chess match, but usually these are ordinary thought-out decisions of daily life, not irrational and unexplained passions resulting from visions.  Moreover, the chain of reasoning is weak.  While Dekker states that "our parents - they died for this day", yet if the parents hadn't died, the terrorists wouldn't have controlled the plantation, Shannon would not have been filled with revenge, and the bomb scenario would not have arisen in the first place. 2. Dekker suggests that God speaks directly to people today in visions, although it could be conceded that this is merely a literary device that serves the plot. 3. There are a few aspects of the plot that are somewhat too implausible, such as Tanya's return to Venezuela at the insistence of her adoptive grandma, and the failure of the two main characters to recognize one another.  The identification of Shannon with Casius is easy to figure out, but I suspect Dekker isn't trying to hide this from us, because he has a much greater surprise regarding character identity in store for us at the conclusion.  These weaknesses aside, on the whole this is a well-written and thought-provoking novel. Overall this novel has less theological weaknesses than the first two, but the theology is more in the background here with the plot taking center stage.  Fans of Robert Ludlum style suspense thrillers will love the fast-paced story-line.  And although it's not quite as deep as his other novels, and the story-line could have been tightened somewhat, the theology is in itself sound.  For a fast paced read with the thrills of Ludlum and the theological depth of Peretti, read of "The Thunder of Heaven" and be reminded that God is the chessmaster behind history, working all things for good.  -GODLY GADFLY 
 I preordered ITM's CD back in September when I heard some of their demos on their MySpace page. I recorded those demos to my MP3 player and found myself listening to them a lot more than I expected. Now their CD is here and, unsurprisingly, it's even better. Their musical style is the perfect blend between metally goodness and melodic sounds. There's not one track on this whole disc that I find myself skipping over, which is impressive to say the least.   I think they're gonna be huge 
 I used Veganese for quite awhile, quite happily.  As there is no artificial fragrance, or strong natural fragrance oils in the product, it has a ho-hum scent.  This actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market.  I felt Veganese adequately conditioned my hair, did not irritate my scalp.  I liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals.  Those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product 
 The definitive work of perhaps the most gifted teacher of Physics ever.  Dr. Feynman was a master of drawing out and identifying what was important in a topic to help make it stick.  He was never condescending and always humorous.   His love for teaching and for Physics is evident in all his works and nowhere more so than here.  More than "instructing," Dr. Feynman will woo you to love Physics as he did.  What more could be said?  
 Randy Newman's portrait of the Southern United States represents a peak in his career and a culmination of four albums. Begged and beaten into the music industry by friends and colleagues (one of them supposedly John Lennon, who called Newman to say that all of the Beatles had heard his demos), Newman's fourth album of original material provides evidence that those friends and colleagues provided us a great service. "Good Old Boys" stands as one of Newman's greatest acheivements, and arguably one of the greatest albums of the 1970s. Rolling Stone even proclaimed it the 393rd best album of all time in 2003 (though it probably deserves to be put much higher).  A furtive glance at the album's title, and an accompanying peek at the song titles ("Rednecks", "Birmingham", Naked Man", "Guilty") would suggest a slam dunk satirical no holds barred slash at the south. Not so. Newman approaches the subject with dignity and a balance not often bequeathed to the United States' southern states. Not to say that "Good Old Boys" eulogizes the South (this is no "Gone With The Wind"). The bad and ugly also creep in: racism, prejudice, drunkedness, poverty, populism, obscenity. Newman, himself a Southerner by birth, has forayed into this territory before. 1970's "12 Songs" included "Old Kentucky Home" and "Yellow Man", though the former contained more nudge nudge satire than "Good Old Boys". This album expands on the themes explored in those songs and expands it into the length of an entire album. The results come out more in context than they do on a song-by-song basis. For example, "Birmingham" and "Marie", both amazing songs, take on a different tone when following "Rednecks". "Rollin'" represents the sigh of denial after a long arduous inhale. The song feels different in isolation than it does at the end of the song cycle of "Good Old Boys". This entails a tightly composed and well thought out collection of amazing songs. They all stand on their own but nonetheless take on a different life in the context of the album.  "Rednecks" has to be Newman's most shocking song for more reasons than its abrasive lyrics. Somehow it manages sympathetic, vindictive, satirical, racist, and anti-racist sentiments all at once. It puts the 'redneck' stereotype under the microscope and proclaims that the issues are more complex than they seem. It revels in Southern stereotypes while pointing the finger northward in the justifiably famous lines about the the northern 'cages' where blacks are kept in the "free" states. Indirectly it says "at least we're honest about it down here". It does all of this without promoting stereotypes or racism. This incomprehensible dichotomy pervades the entire album. Especially in Newman's portrait of Huey Long in "Every Man a King" which leads into "Kingfish".  Newman takes the orchestral lessons and arrangements learned from his previous albums and puts them to incredible work here. Strings, horns, steel guitar, and Newman's distinctive piano all fall together here in perfect balance. Completely gone are the instrumental excesses and self-conscious arrangements of his first two albums (i.e., he overused the orchestra on his first album and abandoned it on his second). "Louisiana 1927" contains one of the most beautifully orchestrated choruses in all of pop music, and stands as one of Newman's best. The amazing strings on "Kingfish" and "Rollin'" also deserve mention, though all songs are notable.  The 2CD set includes the demo for "Good Old Boys" called "Johnny Cutler's Birthday". This reveals the album's origins in a concept album revolving around one person. This focus proved too narrow for the subject matter, and at least six of the songs on the demo did not make the final album. One of them revolves around extreme profanity. Others fill in the story line (narrated by Newman in between his solo piano and voice takes). All are top notch Newman and will leave listeners wondering what else lurks in Newman's vault.  "Good Old Boys" stands as one one Newman's most impressive achievements. Every Randy Newman fan needs this CD set. Both the original album and the demo remain on firm solid concrete hard ground some thirty years later 
 Castle. The word's meaning is amazing. And David Macaulay has done it again! His book, Castle, shows how a castle is built in the Middle Ages. His illustrations show the castle (and the town around it) is built. Mortar and stone by stone, a castle is built. In the time this castle's construction is commencing, there is a war going on, and then it's under attack when it's finished. David shows how the castle withstands a siege from the Welsh prince and his army. This book's drawings are amazing! The book is quite detailed and well described. The book is the Eighth Wonder of the World says I, its one of the best books I've ever read! This book is for knights in shining armour! - February, 2007 
 I found this book in a Peace Corps library in Mali a few weeks ago and read it in a few hours. It was powerful as Baldwin's other work, with 'Another Country' being his crowning achievement as far as I'm concerned, being so brutally honest about what it means to be a minority, in this case, black. As hard as the subject matter is to read and despite how much it forces the reader to stand back and question the way that s/he views themself or others, it is written in a style that is gripping and flows so well that it reads like an excellent novel with a very powerful and important message. It reminds me of the work of Alice Walker, in how he is pleading for people to recognize that love is the solution. I know how trite that sounds, but to me, the love that he is writing about is about having much compassion and understanding, to resist indifference. To open your eyes and to see people, even if they do not appear to be as 'good' as one wants them to be on surface level. Beneathe color and gender, we are all guilty of a sweeter love 
 Have had the rice cooker for about 2 months and we love it.  Rice cooked on the "slow" cycle is superb.  Handles white, brown, long grain and short grain rice equally well and automatically adjusts cooking time to produce perfect rice for each type. Very easy to clean. I believe the "Zutto" series is their top of the line models, and I can see why. 
 The book, The Actor and the Text, by Cicely Berry, is an excellent book which opens actors up to the idea of studying the text of the play rather than the action.  Ms.Berry's book specifically focuses on the text of  William Shakespeare's plays.  She gives detailed examples of exercises that  can be very useful to actors attempting to decipher the language of  Shakespeare.  Personally as an actor, I found this book to be extremely  helpful not only for Shakespeare, but for all plays.  The book really made  me look at plays entirely differently.  In the past when first reading a  play, I would simply read through it and think about where my character  starts out in the beginning of the play and where he would end up at the  end of the play.  When I read a play now I really pay a lot more attention  to the words and the language that the author chose.  Once again, Cicely  Berry's book is an excellent reference for all actors who are looking to  make a personal improvement towards their acting skills and also their  interpretation of language 
 Eric Raymond presents a coherent and well-supported case that explains why open source makes commercial sense. Putting aside the "religious" fervor of some of his arguments, the logic on why the open source movement can spawn successful businesses is irrefutable. Read it and you will understand why traditional (proprietary) software business models have become a dying breed. I would rate the book a "5" but for some parts where the text becomes somewhat convoluted and repetitive. Overall, a must-read for anyone involved in software development 
 Couldn't put this one down once I started reading it.  Detailed without becoming tedious, and with extracts from letters by the people who actually fought the war.  If you have always wondered how it was won and why, and where it was fought, this is the book you want to read.  Covers the important battles in the North, and even better, the battles in the South.  This is good stuff, read it and enjoy 
 This is a very good and compelling naval battle tale that really exposes the heroism of the men of the American Navy during WWII 
 How could one not love the civilization that has contributed the foundations of the West and so much to the world we live in? Bruce Thornton analyses the achievements of the glorious Greeks, from their earliest history to their attitudes toward homoerotic love. This book is a must for all classics, history, anthropology, art history, philosophy, and political science students......or for anyone who wants to be enlightened. There is something Greek in all of us 
 Wow, what a great story. I purchased Karen Monroe's story, Shattered, when a friend recommended it to me. I'm a huge fan of erotic romance, but I love a great story as well. Ms. Monroe has the recipe for a spicy and quality read in Shattered.  Alex, an exotic dancer, instantly enthralls Steve, a millionaire, upon their first meeting. While the plot is great, the chemistry between Alex and Steve steals the show. Ms. Monroe uses great imagery to draw us into Steve and Alex's world. They are both complex persons who are battling with past demons and current struggles, but who can't deny their attraction. Steve will move mountains to get Alex, and she's overwhelmed at times by his intensity. However she realizes that true love can be deep, emotional and steadfast. I enjoyed Alex and Steve's journey towards their HEA, and I highly recommend this story for those who enjoy a good erotic story.   Additonally, the secondary characters, Jake (Steve's brother) and Ameril (Alex's friend), have a hot relationship as well. I certainly hope Ms. Monroe will write their story...SOON! Bravo to Karen Monroe for a winner with Shattered! 
 After having owned this CD for almost a year now and being slightly drunk on cheap cabernet at the moment, I think I am qualified to write a review for this wonderfully relaxing music. Whenever I want to relax, this is high on the list to pop in and enjoy. It's light, breezy, sultry, fun, hip, groovy, and sexy all in one. You really can't go wrong. Buy it. Enjoy it. Enjoy your life. And go ahead, have a drink or two. You deserve it. 
      I've been falling asleep to the sound of rain for over 30 years, and this is one of the best.  It builds slowly, then thunder comes in.  My girlfriend, who's hardly a rain fanatic, now keeps it on ALL NIGHT long.      Whoever had a problem with some minor bird calls should listen to those recorded in forests whose bird shrieks and cackles used to give me nightmares.  That guy's way too sensitive 
 Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King, Great Sage Equalling Heaven, is one of the most endearing and compelling characters in all of human literature. If you don't like Monkey, there's something wrong with you.   This is a wonderous journey, not to be missed by anyone with the slightest interest in fantasy, fable, or mythology. You might like Journey to the West if you enjoy the Arabian Nights, Greek myths, superhero comics, J.R.R. Tolkien, Grimm, Andersen, or modern fantasy.  Someone once identified the "four outstanding novels" of Chinese literature: Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber. Journey to the West may be the least "novelistic" of the lot by western standards but depending on your personal slant, it may be the most appealing.  The novel is composed of 100 chapters, each told as a story such as an oral storyteller might relate. Each chapter ends with a sort of cliffhanger and a directive to read on if you want to know what happens next. This device is common to Three Kingdoms and Outlaws of the Marsh, so we can just take it in stride as a part of classical Chinese lit.  In chapter 1 Monkey is born (hatched ?!) and asserts himself as a force to be reckoned with. He's fairly happy eating exotic fruits and being king of the mountain but eventually the idea of death occurs to him, and he gets quite naturally upset. One of his monkey friends suggests to him that there are 3 kinds of beings who are free from the cycle of death and rebirth: Bhuddas, Immortals, and Sages. The Immortals are enlightened ones of the Taoist faith, and Sages refers to Confucianism. The Handsome Monkey King decides to set out on a journey to gain immortality. Eventually (after about 10 years have passed) he runs into a Taoist Immortal who imparts the secrets of everlasting life and great travel powers to him.  Having acquired great cosmic powers, Monkey proceeds to use them. He causes no end of distress to the kings of Hell in Chapter 3, and soon comes to the attention of Heaven (i.e. the Powers That Be). Heaven attempts to placate Monkey's insatiable lust for power and recognition with a fake job and title. Monkey can be fooled, but only for so long, and in the end he causes chaos in Heaven (which is a bad thing). The Jade Emperor of Heaven calls out all the armies of demons, heavenly generals and warriors, you name it. Time after time they try to take Monkey into custody and fail, until finally the Bhudda himself steps in and traps Monkey. Handsome Monkey King is imprisoned under a mountain for some 500 years (ouch).  By now we're up to chapter 8, in which the Bhodisattva Guanyin sets out on a journey to appoint a pure hearted priest to go west and bring back the scrolls of wisdom from the Bhudda's Western Paradise. On the way Guanyin flags a couple of demons to help the priest on his journey. In chapters 9 through 12 we learn about Sanzang, the Tang Priest who is destined to recover the scriptures from the West, 10 or 20 or 30 thousand miles away. Sanzang is a rather weak fellow, a mere mortal with no special powers of any kind. His strength is the pureness of his heart and his faith in his mission.  The Journey to the West is Sanzang's voyage to recover the scrolls, and it really begins in chapter 13. He does not have an easy time of it, being almost constantly beset by tigers, monsters and demons, not to mention deep dark forests and formidible mountain ranges. However the Tang Priest quickly gets help, in the form of a dragon transformed into a horse, a flesh eating demon who works as a bodyguard and gopher, and a glutinous moronic pig-demon who serves nicely as a luggage carrier. But most importantly he acquires Monkey, who is freed from his imprisonment under the mountain on the condition that he helps the Tang Priest and cultivates his behavior, learning to be a good Bhuddist monk. Imagine Monkey with a shaved head.  Once the cast is assembled, the journey begins in earnest. Monkey, the Idiot (Pig), Sandy and the dragon horse accompany Sanzang through 30000 miles of dangerous terrain, beset by evil spirits and demons at every turn. By this time we're done with chapter 25, 585 pages into the novel, and we've closed the back cover of Volume 1. In the other hand we hold Volume 2, almost drooling with anticipation.  Throughout the next 75 chapters, the action is pretty much non-stop. There are lots of bad guys, and Monkey gets lots of chances to show off his incredible magical powers, his sheer brute force, and his amazing mental capacity. His conversations and arguments with The Tang Priest and The Idiot are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. His martial prowess, wielding the As-You-Will Iron Cudgel, is unparalled. Sometimes even Monkey gets in over his head and has to call in an air strike in the form of Heavenly forces, or various Gods, Constellations, or other muscle.  I won't give away the ending, but suffice it to say it's a happy one, after 2317 pages.  As to the quality of the translation I have nothing to add. It was more than readable to me: it was a delight, poetry and all.  As to the quality of the editing, it's not perfect. On the other hand, the flaws don't detract from the experience at all.  As to the quality of the printing: keep in mind that this is published by Foreign Language Press of Beijing. In some ways FLP doesn't live up to American standards of production quality, but in others it excells them. The paper is necessarily thin, but the books are tightly bound. These are not mass-market paperbacks. One does not feel that the books will fall apart on a second reading, and there is very little danger of breaking the spine. Also, Journey to the West is nicely illustrated with Qing Dynasty pictures. The quality of the reproductions is not the highest, but let's not bite the hand that feeds us. My box of Journey to the West was a bit scuffed and dinged and dented. Same with the other titles I have purchased from FLP through Amazon. I imagine this is FLP's fault. I'm not entirely happy about it but for a book this great, I can live with a couple of small physical flaws (especially at this price). I'm just happy I got my grubby little monkey paws on it 
 A buddy of mine turned me on to these guys and I HAD to have this CD.  As a sax player, I've got to take my hat off to their saxman.  Track 10 has probably one of the funkiest sax lines I've heard since the Brecker Bros. were hot in the late 80's.  The sax/guitar licks are supertight.  The band I play with is even covering the tune "Thrill" we dig it so much.  I'm even thinking of carting a bari around so we could cover Hit the Wall.  Get it, turn it up and jam 
 An excellent read from start to finish. Anasi's style jumps around a little bit (flashback, present, flash"sideways?"), but it adds to the flavor. I really felt a part of the scene. Also, Anasi's knowledge of the sport, and racial tensions, is deep. Opinionated, but deep. The ending could have been stronger - that's the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars 
 This book on collecting is itself a rare bird--a scholarly book so beautifully written one begins to think about the sentence itself as a material object.  Provocative and artful, the book uses mosaic form to build its arguments.  Of interest to general readers but also to scholars who wish to depart from the tired old forms 
 I would like to say that I remember this book from 30 years ago, when I lost track of my copy, and have been trying to track one down ever since (with temporary success -- now I'm finally buying a copy again, thank goodness it is STILL IN PRINT - can you believe it-haven't been so luck on other titles). So, I would like to re-writ my review AFTER I have read it again. Having said this, I will say this about the book. It had a wonderful description of the Tobler Chocolate factory and what I learned about chocolate, I think about every time I enjoy really GOOD choclate (in fact, that's how I know it's really good -- it's in the "conching." This book introduced me to Raclette, which I enjoyed immensely and often during the several months I lived in Switzerland a few years later. There is a memorable Neufchatel Wine Tart. The book was a great "read," as I recall; I just loved it 
 I was a little worried when I bought this towel for my son,  because he is a very particular person, and only likes good things. Well, here's what he had to say:  "This is a great towel, and it is the best I've ever used". Here you go! He approves of it! I say: "Buy it with confidence" 
   Randall, Lisa, Warped Passages, Harper Perennial, New York, 2005              Randall does an excellent job of bring extra dimensions out of the realm of mystery into  the real world as real possibilities and, for that reason alone, the book deserves its accolades.  She does so by humanizing dimensions: the sports couch potato is one dimensional, the couch potato who also drives fast cars is two dimensional, and the couch potato who drives and also bets on the dogs is three dimensional.  Just like Lee Smolin anthropomorphized an event based universe by comparing it with the story of a human person so Randall anthropomorphizes dimensionality by comparing it with the traits of a human person.  Interesting.              But than she only gives an account of  "particle" physics and that mechanization of quantum physics is its dullest cousin.  It generated a lot of excitement and Nobles years ago but notwithstanding string theory, it has made no real progress since the 1970s.  And that's because it still rides around in Newton's SUV and that machine, a true wonder back in the 17th century, is not the all-terrain vehicle it was advertised to be.  It cannot negotiate the heights 20th century science discovered beyond the paved surfaces of a background dependent universe.  Perhaps she will step outside that machine and do a second book that will consider relativity - like Brian Greene did.              She models the universe "bottom-up" from empirical data, observation, and prediction; she does not model down from theory, she models up from the  mud her machine drives around in.  She calls this approach model building and quite fairly contrasts it with theorists and relates the two approaches to the perennial Plato/Aristotle, Parmenides/Heraclitus dichotomy that complementarity honors as two ways of looking at a reality so rich that neither alone does it justice.              She moves from the "old quantum theory" of Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac a theory that saw the universe as a dynamic relational process "onto the real road of quantum mechanics" driven by DeBroglie, Shrodinger and Born in Newton's machine therefore retaining the classical fundamentals; its absolutes.  She allows that quantum mechanics denies "particles" a trajectory, but she never mentions that quantum physics also denies particles an independent position and denies them an independent momentum which leads to the inescapable conclusion that a particle is not a particle for what kind of particle can be a particle without a position or a momentum or a trajectory.  She, thus, does not open the true depths of quantum physics to her readers:  In a throw-away, she tells us that we can never explore things at the Planck length because the smaller the thing or place, the more energy it takes to make measurements and to try to introduce the needed energy into a Plank space would result in a black hole so why bother trying to explain interactions at that level.  But she neglects to mention proposed observations on cosmic levels that could detect the effects of quantized space at the Planck scale.              Actually, she never mentions quantizing space or time or spacetime, but, at the very end, she does mention the status of spacetime.  In these throw-away lines she allows that future development in science may have to question the nature of spacetime and suggests that one of the questions may be whether it is fundamental or derivative, whether it is an affect of some more fundamental process.  Nonetheless, the whole book, all its contents and arguments and expositions, without one exception, the whole thing, assumes that spacetime serves as the faithful background on which her particles play out their existence or the strings whose vibrations generate the particles dance.  She therefore never reaches the questions concerning the absolute nature of spacetime.  Since she doesn't mention the problems a background dependent universe poses, she seems to assume that space is absolute, time is absolute and spacetime is absolute.  (In his second book, Brian Greene concedes that, if quantum gravity is going to work, the universe has to be background independent.)              Beyond dimensions, she focuses on branes.  For each new problem, she fashions a new type of brane and, whirling about, she is thrilled to pin this new brane onto the picture and thereby provide a way to explain away the problem.  This brings to mind the complex of epicycles Copernicus sorted out when he found a radically new model that simplified the system.  It's a good bet that displacing her "particles" from the center of the universe and replacing them with actions will simplify things and move science back to a proper "passion for comprehension" (See Einstein's article in the April, 1950 Scientific American) rather than the mere thrill of achievement.  So the book is a bit flat.  It doesn't communicate that awesome sense of wonder new discoveries of natural processes should, and usually do, inspire.  Thrilling yes, but not profound; blueberry hillish, but not Dantesque. 
 ARSIS - A Celebration of Guilt - I had read reviews saying this is par, if not better, then the older works of bands like In Flames, At the Gates or Dark Tranquillity!!! As you should know this is a bold claim.   Added to my doubt was the fact that this was the brainchild of two Americans... Yep TWO Americans... Yep AMERICANS.  And they aren't exactly known for being original when it comes to the Swedish Melo-Death sound.    "Nicholas Adam Chupka" (A reviewer which I seem to be akin with their tastes) gave this a very positive review... Not to mention all the other 4-5 Stars reviews... Anyway enough explanation - here is the review: ---From the opening passage of "Face of my Innocence" until the closer "Wholly Night" my Ears were held hostage by, what is quite possibly, my new favorite Death/Melodic Band.  Looking at this from a musicianship standpoint it is damn near impossible to pick out any flaws... The Guitar work is beautifully crafted... The Drumming flows perfectly and the bass holds everything together.  Vocally it is in vein of traditional venomous Swedish acts such as older In Flames or ATG.  But not for one second does his voice come across as "forced."   These 2 musicians have great chemistry listen to Track #5 (Worship Depraved) at the 2:00 mark onwards... Just freaking incredible!!!   The only downside might be the lack of variation... Basically, every song kicks and equal amount of ass.  Upon a start to finish listen it may grow slightly tiresome. (However one listen to the A Diamond for a Disease EP and you will quickly realize they have over come their only flaw.) Favorite Songs: Face of my Innocence, Worship Depraved, and The Sadistic Motives Behind Bereavement Letters. -4.5 Stars.   IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR: "Was this review helpful?"   
 14 Video Paintings by Brian Eno is exactly what I expected and hoped for: an 'art-y', slightly pretentious but riveting video experience. As an artist, photographer and lover of all-things-Eno I'm very happy with the purchase 
 This was one of the best books I have ever read. The story is about a clone called Matteo Alcrán, who doesn't know anything of "real" life. Almost everyone hates him, El Patron wants to use him for transplants, and Felicia wants to kill him. Life couldn't get much worse, could it? Matt thinks he is different from other clones, and will not be used for transplants, but that would ruin the book... This is a great book, realistic fiction, and something or other.  
 Maxwell's book has many simple lessons for leadership, however I was disappointed to learn that the website cited in this book did not work. After a search on the internet I did locate the site under a different URL title -- http://www.lawsofteamwork.com/  John Maxwell has many valuable insights into organizational leadership and principles of teamwork that many of my graduate students enjoy. This book relates several good stories about the importance of teamwork, including one about former MLB player Reggie Jackson and Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver. The 17 Essential Qualities of a Team Player is a great resource and a fast read for those interested in learning more about leadership and teamwork 
 In the late 13th century, three Venetian merchants, two brothers and the son of one of them, visited China, which was then ruled by the Mongols. The Mongols distrusted the native Chinese and hired foreigners such as the young man as minor officials. The Venetian merchant-turned-official traveled extensively through North and South China, South-East Asia and India. After he returned to Venice, he took part in a war between Venice and Genoa, was taken prisoner, and in prison met a professional writer who wrote a book based on his memoirs and embellished it with the stock devices of late medieval romances. Among various Asiatic curiosities Messer Polo describes asbestos, coal, tigers, musk deer, sago and coconuts. He tells the story of the Buddha, describes the Mongol postal system (I was surprised that yamb, which is obviously the root of the Russian word yamshchik, a postal courier, is a Mongol word), Chinese paper money and the life of Indian yogis. For him, the Shinto "idols" of Japan are offensive for a Christian to read about, but the virginity test administered to prospective daughters-in-law in South China isn't. Marco Polo is no Jonathan Spence; he is not trying to get the reader inside the heads of people belonging to an alien culture; he is a merchant, and cares much more about the crops that grow in a certain kingdom or a region, and the crafts its inhabitants practice. Anyway, it is an enjoyable read if you liked Herodotus or the Russian Primary Chronicle. When I read it on the bus, the white man in the seat to the left of me was reading a textbook of Mandarin, and the white man to the right was practicing his Kanji - we are all Marco Polos now 
 Eleven-year-old Penrod Schofield isn't really a bad kid. But circumstances and timing conspire in such a way that he manages to leave a trail of destruction everywhere he goes. This book chronicles Penrod's adventures with his buddy, Sam, his dog, Duke, and his new neighbors, brothers Herman and Verman. It's a hilarious, madcap romp that quickly covers a lot of ground and frequently leaves Penrod's backside smarting at the hand of his exasperated father.   If you enjoyed Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn, then do yourself a favor and read Penrod. It's a page-turner, laugh-out-loud funny, and a classic in its own right. For decades, Penrod was very popular novel. But it fails today's litmus test of political correctness, so it is probably doomed to be forgotten. And that's a real tragedy. Penrod is beautifully written. It is filled with love, wit, and charm. And ninety years after it was written, most of what it has to say about people still rings true. Whenever I need a dose of innocence, humor, and insightful commentary on the human condition, I know I can rely on Tarkington to deliver the goods. It's a cliche, but they don't write them like this anymore. Too bad for us. 
 This is a significant effort from pioneer smooth jazz artist, Walter Beasley, that was not apparent from a first listen. But, after twice hearing his rousing renditions of Deniece Willliams', "Free" and William DeVaughn's, "Be Thankful for What You Got," it was apparent to me that this is one of the better smooth jazz releases for 2007. These renditions by Walter Beasley essentially re-invents these songs making them sound better than the already great originals. There are other compositions on this release that are also quite pleasant, and the recording quality of this disc is of reference quality. I would describe its sonic signature as clean, musical, and well balanced. The sound is the soulful side of smooth jazz, and it is quite good although you may have to skip around some of the songs on this CD. It certainly deserves to be in your collection if you like smooth jazz. However, please don't borrow it or burn (copy) it, but buy it, so we can keep these artists in business and encourage them to make more music. I say this because in all candor, I would rate this a 4.5 as this is not the best I've heard from Mr. Beasley. But, there is a distinct lack of new music from this genre, and new music will only come if we support these musicians.  
 From start to end this album tugs at your mind and heart. The thought and curiosity of "what in the world is this guy so passionate about" crosses the front of your brain-this creates an immediate interest; or at least it did for me. Aaron  Weiss' lyric's-(poems rather) put to music bring an artistic collision that has never been done in this 'type' of music. What type you might ask-well they have their own catagory and whatever it is it's amazing. Their biblical lyrics and stories of the test's and trials us human's face touch home and inspire. The best tracks are 'Bullet To Binary', Everything Was Beautiful..."(track 4), 'Gentleman'-my personal favorite. They're all great, those simply stand out to me. Watch for the bonus track following the last track which is an acoustic version of 'I Never Said That I Was Brave' it's a pleasant surprise. This band has stole my interest and I hope you give them a listen. Their currently on tour with Coheed and Cambria in a venue near you and I suggest you give them a shot. They were just here(AZ) on the 21st of October. 
 I was very moved by this book and would highly recommend it. The story touches on so many important issues but the one that always stood out to me is the issue of poverty in this country and how most of us are completely unaware of it - or we forget it exists. I can no longer open my full refridgerator or feed my baby the wholesome foods I give her without thinking of Jeannette Walls and her siblings and the struggle they had as children to stay nourished. As a result, I hope to do more community service and give where I can to those in need 
 The story of a tenth-century Mandarin who travels through time to Germany in the 1980s, Rosendorfer's book is told as a series of letters to a friend back home. At heart, this book is an attempt to examine the fundamental  questions of how our lives are affected by progress. For the most part, it  succeeds. This book is quite humorous, and a highly enjoyable reading  experience. Recommened 
 I have reviewed a fair number of DVD sets that collect TV series, and have tried to focus on the original content while disregarding the larger aspects of the DVD package. After all, the majority of fans buy these packages for the original episodes, and DVD bonus items are usually inconsequential gravy. I even discussed this same matter in my review for Addams Family Volume 1. But alas, for Volume 2, I am compelled to break my own rules and dock the DVD package one star for reasons that have nothing to do with the greatness of the original episodes. MGM must be criticized for stretching the two original seasons into three DVD releases, regardless of their PR about making each set more affordable. What really creates the expense is the addition of modern bonus material, and here, that material is so thin and weak that it reveals, harshly, MGM's real motives for putting the Addams Family show on DVD. The key bonus item is a brief and poorly-produced documentary on a squishy subject - the influence of the show on pop culture - with most of the commentary coming from C-list cronies and hangers-on who crowd out the under-utilized John Astin. The other bonus items here are even less useful, including unfunny "commentary" on a few episodes by stand-ins for Thing and Cousin Itt, and a feature called "Tombstone Trivia" on a couple of episodes, which is merely pop-up tidbits that appear on the screen an average of once every several minutes.  So beware that your love of the classic Addams Family show is being manipulated by modern cheaply-created corporate filler. As for the show itself, hopefully it will still be easy for you to love the episodes that are presented here. Rest assured that these episodes still brutally satirize the typical middle-American sitcom family and subversively reveal much deeper family values. These episodes also feature many crucial character developments. Important advancements include "Morticia Meets Royalty" in which Thing falls in love, and "Lurch the Teenage Idol" in which our faithful butler accidentally becomes a rock star. The highlight of this package is surely the two-part "Morticia's Romance," in which the sexy Carolyn Jones manages to be fetching in three different ways - as the present Morticia, the younger Morticia, and her sister Ophelia. That episode also features Margaret (Wicked Witch of the West) Hamilton as Morticia's mother. As noted above, I have broken my own rule about ignoring modern DVD packaging practices while assessing only the original content. But here, try not to let your love for the episodes be damaged by the weaknesses of the package. [~doomsdayer520~]   
 This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.  For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.   At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.  I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says "here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...").  Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book 
 This third novel in Mr. Head's epic Dragon's Fury Series is by far the most compelling.  All along Mr. Head has mixed a number of social, political, immigration, and other issues into his writing about an all too believable global war developing out of current circumstances.  But in this novel he brings it all together amidst the excitement and intrigue to hammer home the relevancy of underlinging moral values to the cause of America's liberty.  I will not go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that the effect was, in my opinion, stunning.  In this novel, America finally starts to turn a corner and realize some positive offensive action in the global war it has been forced into against Red China and its allies, including a confederation of the fuindamental Islamic nations.  In a pivotal set of circumstances that will have historians recognizing the historical relevance of events over 60 years ago...Russia s drawn into the conflict on a huge scale as well.  I can't say enough about the excitement, intrigue, attention to historical and technical detail, and the characterization that is woven into these novels.  Anyone who is a fan of this genre will want to read the entire series 
 a great book for a novice to start off with as it includes all the basic techniques needed. However for more advance students, i would rather reccomend larry teal's art of playing the saxophone as it contains more details 
 This book really came in handy on our trip.  The menu cut out cards and the flash cards proved to be very valuable to us, especially since a friend gave us the bad advice that everyone spoke some English.  Don't believe that, there were a number of people that did speak some amount of English but we both wished that we had taken more time before our trip to learn a littlem ore of the language 
 Sure, it might be a little outdated, but it's a great glimpse into a past time.  And today's kids would probably enjoy the chance to do some old-fashioned things described in this book, like making their own hammock or refurbishing some old furniture.  The instructions for painting and drawing and basic and useful, and many of the ideas presented are things forgotten about and could stand resurrection.  Lots of attention paid to girls getting exercise and being healthy, contrary to modern perceptions of Victorian women.  Good for parents and teachers, and kids who are fond of history and open to old-fashioned ideas 
 My immediate impression of this book is that it is DIFFERENT than most of what else is available.  Good for this author to direct a book to a niche for once!  Anyone can see it isn't for a beginner.  I could see that I couldn't live without it on my own shelf.  There are plenty of how to books for the individual who wants just ONE book.  This is for the connoisseur of art ideas and techniques.  While not noted as such, I find this author very "right brain" and right is right 
 This is currently my favorite T Corp studio album.  What an excellent collection of tunes 
 This is the best and superb diet. I tried weight watchers, zone, Atkins and south beach diet but the problem is with all above diet are the weight loss is for short period of time.  I lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks and the weight loss is permanent. Follow Jorge plan and see how pounds will shed amazingly.  
 Larry Brown uses clear simple sentences in the vein of Ernest Hemingway ("The Old Man and the Sea") to expound the journey of Fay Jones, a 17-year-old beauty, fleeing the increasingly sexual come-ons of her father, Wade Jones.  "Fay" is set in the harsh world of Mississippi where the characters tend to have little education, money or choices.  Fay is so desperate to leave her shack and would-be incestuous father, that despite only having two dollars, a half-pack of cigarettes and a pair of ratty tennis sneakers, she begins walking away with only the dim notion of going to Biloxi because it is on the coast and life must be better there.  	Fay's one advantage is her beauty, but Brown does not go into detail about her appearance, except to say that her bosom is quite ample.  It seems because of her outstanding looks that she is helped several times throughout the novel.  At times it seems she is so innocent and would never use her "assets" to her advantage, but then there are several instances where she blatantly takes advantage.  Most clear example being is Fay decides after a shower to slip off her towel in front of the recently widowed Sam Harris, the state trooper who picks up Fay on Highway 55.  She never ate popcorn, went to a movie or made a telephone call, but she is far from innocent.  Already at her young age she has a hankering for beer and cigarettes, and continues her habits even though she becomes pregnant due to Sam's inability to resist Fay's siren call.    	Sam and the other man who is her main squeeze in the novel, Aaron, a strip-club bouncer who moonlights as a drug dealer, is also enticed by Fay's song.  Perhaps their only chance was to tie themselves to a mast like Ulysses did in Homer's "The Iliad."  Nonetheless, Fay, a girl with a woman's body, who left school early and lived in conditions that would be considered more akin to a third-world country can not be wholly to be blamed.  For the milieu Fay has been born into and is struggling to survive in would be considered a society of dregs, or better known as white trash since the novel takes place in the American south.  One roots for Fay, but there is also a sneaking suspicion in the back of one's mind: nothing good can come out of the gumbo of a mess that these people's lives are.  Despite knowing the character's propensities, the ending still felt too neatly tied up and a cheat in some ways.  However, an overall astounding look at characters living to just survive, often on a daily basis, by using simple, but beautifully written prose.  Bohdan Kot 	  	 
 Enjoyed the book thoroughly, well written, with many great photographs. The book gives the reader insights into what makes John "tick" - a great drag racer and an interesting person 
 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've had no problems with this battery...and I've had it over a year.  I'm a pro photographer, so it has been recharged over and over and over and still holds a charge.  Maybe it is better because I tend to totally drain my batteries before recharging?  I also use this battery in the Dual Battery Grip alongside the Canon and other off brand batteries 
 Hey, the extras disc has menus in Chinese..they still work, and you can view all the stuff, but you have to guess at what each menu option will do...anyone else get this 
 My French was in its infantile stages when I read this book, but opening a dictionary once, twice, or many times per page was a small price to pay for the stimulation I got from reading this book.  The pure artistry of the writing not only inspired me to keep reading, but to have French as a double major.  When you read this book, you are there 
 I am very happy with the quality of this product.  It arrived with no scratches or marks and the pictorial directions were easy to follow.  The dresser looks great and I'm sure that it will provide years of use for our baby 
 This book is extremely valuable for learning how to place protection or setting up anchors for trad climbing or top rope anchor setup. My friends and I carefully studied this book and went out and practiced placing gear and setting up anchors from the ground. When we went and took an anchor building class, we learned a lot of good tips, but the information we learned from this book helped us rapidly advance in our class. This book also is very helpful after you learn your basics because you can analyze various anchor setups and compare it to the analysis in the book. One drawback of this or any other book is that a picture is never as good as inspecting protection on your own at various angles close up. For this reason, you will want to go climbing with a more experienced partner or an instructor so they can give you more detailed feedback on your own protection placement skills 
 Ragtime is the story of various levels of American society in about the first decade of the 20th century, a period Doctorow dubs "The Age Of Ragtime" after the popularity of the music Scott Joplin and other composers are writing at this time. In this curious novel, we meet real and invented people interacting on a taut little stage. Here we find Harry Houdini, Evelyn Nesbit, Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, Harry Thaw, Booker T. Washington and other famous and infamous men and women from this time, and we also meet some archetypal constructs known to us by such designations as "Father" "Younger Brother" "Mother" etc. There is the upper-class white family from New Rochelle, headed by an explorer father; there is the ambitious, hard working Jewish family, new to America's shores, headed by a kind-hearted man whose brain teems with ideas for inventions; and there is a black "family" composed of an unwed father and mother (a Ragtime pianist, and a young woman who is eventually taken in by the white family) and an infant son. The bulk of the story of Ragtime trickles through the lives of these people, and passes notoriously through passion-fueled murder, bigotry, accidental killings, social glory, revolutionary schemes, and acts of---justified?---terrorism. Ragtime moves so far away from the plot of its beginnings it is impossible to predict its destination, a reader merely hangs on for the bumpy, wavering ride through our American nation in its teenaged years 
 The Punk O Rama series is always full of great stuff, but this was my favorite so far. This has awesome tracks by Tiger Army, The Distillers, Motion City Soundtrack, Bad Religion and so much more. It has both older and newer punk bands for a good balance. I didn't listen to the second Cd for a while but once I did, I was in love. My favorite tracks are "Incorporeal" by Tiger Army and Millencolin's "Bowmore". If you are interested in learning about punk music or love it alreay, this is the perfect comp for you 
 This book has just been re-released and it was really a good choice!  Josie and her husband Cooper have their lives pretty well arranged.  He is an architect and she runs a thriving computer company.  Well, maybe its a little too thriving - she does put in very long hours.  But they manage to work out an arrangement to even accomodate that.  Then something they didn't expect happens.  Her brother and sister-in-law die in an auto accident and they have been named the legal guardians for their 2 small children (Lucy, 4 years old and Ben, 9 months).  Josie can't even bring herself to consider such an arrangement.  Her life is the way she wants it.  The thought of the children terrifies her.  But Cooper sees the need of the children and manages to convinced Josie to try it.  He takes on the main responsibility and really comes into his own.  Josie becomes more and more involved in work and it seems as if there is no viable solution.  The main point of the book is love.  Love between couples and love of family.  With love and cooperation and listening, miracles can happen.    Cooper and Lucy really carry the book.  There are times you will find yourself just smiling as their relationship develops.  A great book by Suzanne Brockmann.  No Navy Seals but a lot of good characterizations 
  HOUR OF THE GUN (1967) takes off where director John Sturges' earlier "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" (1957) left off.  The movie opens with Wyatt Earp (James Garner) and Doc Holliday (Jason Robards) trading hot lead with the Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) gang in the Tombstone corral, follows with an extended courtroom scenes in which Earp has to defend himself against charges of wrongful homicide, and concludes with the meat of the movie - the death and serious wounding of Earp's brothers by members of the Clanton gang, and Earp's extended chase of everyone involved.   Revenge almost always works in westerns, and HOUR OF THE GUN is a revenge western.  Garner, whose greatest assets are warm charm and an embracing smile, has to play it frosty and focused.  The main pull in this movie is constantly brought up by Earp's unlikely friend, the ever loyal Doc Holliday - is Earp an upholder of the law, or someone who uses the law as a means by which he can cold-bloodedly track down and kill the men who murdered and maimed his brothers?  I don't normally judge a movie by its historical accuracy (at least as far as I understand the history,) but HOUR OF THE GUN begs it when it inserts a title card after the opening credits proclaiming `this is how it really happened,' or words to that effect.  The movie gets Earp's post-O.K. Corral vendetta right and his complex relationship with Holliday is believable.  On the other hand, the movie paints Earp as a do-gooder who's driven to the Dark Side by Clanton and his evil machinations - the corral gunfight, even, seems a set-up job by the crafty `Cowboy' (old slang for livestock rustler.)  The biggest historical inaccuracy has to do with Clanton's death - I won't throw a spoiler in here, but the movie's penultimate showdown between its protagonist and antagonist works better as a symbolic, rather than factual, capstone.    All in all this is a pleasant enough depiction of Earp's vendetta ride against the Clanton gang.  As far as I'm concerned Garner is one of the great under-rated actors of his time, and if he puts a dimmer on his magnetic smile he's makes a convincing Earp - his scenes with Robards, always good, are worth the rental or purchase price.  Robards' Doc Holliday is a plum of a part - dissolute gambler, chronic alcoholic, suffering from late-stage tuberculosis.  Ryan may play a Clanton a little more smooth and calculating than his real-life model, but he's so good in these kind of roles it doesn't matter.  Strong recommendation. 
 Loyalty.com explains how customer loyalty can increase the company profits. Companies must focus on building relationships with their customers. Loyalty is the last level of a customer relationship. The importance of this relationship is finely presented by the author 
 Milton Friedman, now approaching 94 has for his entire lifetime been the vanguard of freedom in academia. "Capitalism and Freedom" dispels the so-called myths about capitalism that have become prevalent in society. The book was orignally writeen in 1962 so that is the era in which his point are made. However, they are points that never go out of sytle. He refutes the lie that the free-market caused the depression (it was actually a tyrannical Federal Reserve), that socialism can be democratic, and others. Friedman discusses public education, roads, minimum wage laws (which he calls, "the most anti-black law on the books,"), as well as the how so-called "progressive" tax system and welfare actually hurt the poor.  Please understand that Friedman is NOT a "right-wing" extremist as some knucklehead below states. He is a libertarian. He developed the idea of the negative income tax to help the poor. His ideas were to help people not hurt them with the free-market. Someone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. 
 The passionate, sexy couple in this novel aren't Gilbert and Anne, even though they are newlyweds. It's handsome Owen Ford and the beautiful Leslie Moore who are passionately in love. They are one hot, gorgeous couple--in fact, they make Anne and Gilbert seem dull, bland and boring by comparison!   Both Leslie and Owen are renegades--non-conformists who follow their own rules and live by their wits. They've both been hurt and disillusioned by the world around them. But they're also idealists who secretly desire love--and when they first met, the sexual attraction is so intense you can almost feel it through the pages of the book! This attraction grows stronger and Owen eventually decides his love for the married Leslie is wrong--so he tragically leaves town, assuming he will never see her again. By an odd twist of fate, Leslie eventually becomes a "free woman" and they reunite. The passion and desire felt between them is beautifully written--and it's extremely sensual for a book first published in 1917. By comparison, Anne and Gilbert are the boring married couple who are settled in their ways. We are even treated to their "first fight." Lucy Maud Montgomery admired men who were creative free-thinkers and non-conformists---both Owen Ford and another favorite--Barney Snaith of "The Blue Castle"--fit this description perfectly. Unfortunately Gilbert doesn't even come close. As the tiny town's physician, he has become self-righteous and uptight. Lucy  Maud stopped making Gilbert interesting after her second "Anne" book and he's basically a non-entity from there on. But you won't say that about Owen! 
 but also about the history of ethnic Greeks in Asia Minor, and in the United State 
 Provides a comprehensive walk down memory lane for this unique American event, the likes of which we will probably never see again. As we were about to experience a technology revolution, all of the depictions of the future offered up by the Fair provided so much hope and optimism for the future. Very complete visual account of the Fair with some text. I wish the pictures were larger with some color images as well (although the cost would increase). Perhaps a little more text about the Fair would have been better. Overall, a very good account of the '64 Worlds Fair which will no doubt bring back some good memories of a very different time 
 Excellent book. Straightforward wasy instructions. You can buy the wood and go from the plans or you can buy simple kits to assemble [... 
 A fellow is jailed for killing his estranged wife, but he actually had been at a bar, picked up a woman and took her to a show. Except that the cops don't believe him because everyone says they never saw him with the woman. His secretary, Ella Raines, is determined to find the phantom lady, with the help of his best friend and a detective.   Nice jobs by Franchot Tone as the best friend and Thomas Gomez as the detective, and a great job by Elisha Cook Jr as a strange drummer who takes Raines to an after-hours jazz club. I've always liked Tone and think he was a very good actor. And as the years went by he became even better.  This is a solid noir with a couple of unusual, surreal scenes. One of these days I hope someone brings it out on DV 
 Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens. The main character, Pip, grow up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, He lives with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that live wish her Pip hoped that Miss Havisham intentions were to make his fortune, make him a gentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, because the social class division leaves Pip a worker, and Estella was a lady. After disappointment, Pip hears news that a secrete benefactor want to make Pip a gentleman and give him a fortune and informs him that he is a man of great expectation. Pip has no idea of who is benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman. Even if Pip work hard for his life but he is getting on well finally.  It is a very powerful book that connects with people s live all over. Great expectation is an amazing book in many ways such as the themes, the Character and the writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book is affection, loyalty and gratitude and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The Character of Pip made me feel quit e sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally. There are many character of this book. That also made this book very interesting follow 
 The book gives a very clear and concise review of many topics while still hitting on the main points.  There are many good diagrams and tables, and the questions at the end of each chapter are very good 
 Having discovered Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series has made me what to be a bounty hunter. Her fourth book in her series finds Stephanie once again facing disasters, blowing up cars and suffering her mother's ever present disappointment. For those that liked her first three, will continue to discover that if it could happen to anyone it would be Stephanie. 
 This is one of the best books I have read dealing with Shakespeare. Becuase it has such a specific focus, the year 1599, it is able to take an indepth look at some of Shakespeare's best work. The book focuses on some of Shakespeare's best plays: Julius Ceaser, As You Like It, and Hamlet, but unlike so many other Shakesperian analysis he does not look at this only from a literary standpoint Shapirio looks at it from a historical view. Shapirio chronicles the events in Shakespeare's life and in local and global politics that would effect what he was writting in a particular year. This specificity of this topic allows Shapirio to fully engage the reader in intresting and unique analysis of very well known plays. Though this book is detailed and very focused it is by no means dull. This book is engaging and witty throughout. I would strongly reccomend this to anyone intrested Shakespeare or the Elizabethan Era. 
 Easily one of the best "La Traviata" recordings EVER if not THE best.  A perfect cast, and everything about this recording is simply beautiful in every way.  A must-have in the collections of all opera lovers 
 And, where Bush is planning on taking us from there? Well, this book gives you the answers to those questions and a whole lot more. Greg Palast gets access to information that the fat cats would rather you and I never see. He has an uncanny knack for building relationships with those with access to the insider info and the inner workings of those who craft our foreign and domestic policy, who they are, who they work for, their motivations and their goals. This really is a must read book for all Americans regardless of political stripe. You owe it to your country to know how and why we are in the mess we're in in Iraq and a whole lot more. Buy it today. You won't regret it 
 I was all prepared to rate "Hard Boiled" as a slightly above average Hong Kong shoot-em-up that was entertaining but nothing that would distinguish it from similar fare.  Then director John Woo serves up an inspired finale in a hospital that has to rank as one of the most ingenious action segments in screen history.  The set-up is that some gangsters have stashed an arsenal in the hospital morgue.  The police have uncovered the operation which leads to a stand-off between them and the hoods.  Caught in between are the hospital staff, the patients, and some oh-so-cute newborn babies.  The less said the better.  Nevertheless, Woo throws out the rulebook as to what can be done in an action film.  Woo was essentially toying with us for the first hour or so in order to throw at us this delicious curveball.  I can imagine some people revulsed by this segment.  Personally, I was awestruck and grateful for an artist like Woo for taking a risk 
 You have to be around my age (i.e., older than dirt) to remember Barry Goldwater, a right-wing Republican from Arizona who wrote a book with the above title and spectacularly lost to Lyndon Johnson in the presidential race of '64. I invoke his long-dead phrase because, without the irony, it could be UWE's subtitle. Conrad actively hated leftists and self-proclaimed "revolutionaries," and this disgust shines through all of his best work, from the sniveling proto-unionist Donkin in "...Narcissus" through the bestial "generals" of "Nostromo" and, needless to say, the uber-hypocrite Kurtz. Razumov's moment of conservative illumination, in the snow on the night Haldin destroys his life, can be read as serious, humorous, or anywhere in between--but it is genuine. That fragment he pins to his wall (and which Councilor Mikulin finds so fascinating) sums up with Conradian depth and precision today's popular doctrine of personal responsibility. Peter Ivanovich, one of the slimiest characters on record (not to mention his "Egeria") could easily send major liberals over the wall. Naturally, all readers are free to interpret political novels as they see fit, but Conrad's biographers have documented his rightward tilt. UWE is wonderful proof that genius does not play politics. The novel's other virtues are too numerous to list here. I could read it every year for the rest of my life, and probably will 
 My lab this wagon for use in the field. We all LOVE it! It is just what we needed. Everything (and anything) fits in it and it's easy to clean. It was a great buy 
 Fraser's incredibly informative biography of France's most notorious queen truly is a journey, but a vastly entertaining one at that.  While a reader might be confused by all of the different names and titles, Fraser keeps the narrative interesting and her tone is much like that of a novel.  While this is yet another historical personage that will be dealt with in film (Kirsten Dunst doing the honors), this biography is gripping and entertaining until the end. 
 She asked me for all the old Wham and George Michael videos and this is EXACTLY what she wanted 
 I've been a Foxtrot reader for a long time and personally I think there is something suspiciously wrong with people who don't find Bill Amend's characters funny as all get out. If you want a good laugh, check out Bill in your local newspaper, or better yet, get one of the Foxtrot books. They are all great, really, they are.  Like many of Mr. Amend's fans I'm a bit disappointed he's switching his strip to Sunday-only, but fortunately I can still read him daily in the Foxtrot books. Get them one and all and you can keep right on a laughing 
 This is a great book that tells all about fossil 
 Wow!  I wish there were more stars so I could give this series at least 6!  A friend of mine recommended this book and I was a little leery about reading it at first due to the time travel compenent (sounded weird and I've never been a scifi fan), but finally decided to read it because my friend spoke so highly of it and our tastes are very similar.    I've never written a book review before, but feel compelled to comment on this one.  Outlander is an intoxicating combination of historical action/adventure fiction, time travel and romance.  There are lots of plot twists, as much action as a James Bond movie and as many characters as a Dickens novel.  The characters are so vividly drawn that you feel you know them as intimate friends by the end of the book/series.  The historical details are fascinating and life in 17th century Scotland is described in such exquisite detail that you feel as if you have visited Scotland.  However, be warned.  These books are highly addictive!  If you read this, you will be compelled to read the rest of the books in this series (to date, dragonfly in amber, voyager, drums of autumn, fiery cross, and breath of snow and ashes).  I read all six of the series in six weeks (6000+ pages / 3 million words).  My husband says I became obsessed with the books and read them to the exclusion of everything else including housework, friends, family and him.  It became so bad that by the time I was nearing the end of the last book, (breath of snow and ashes), he was threatening to leave me unless I gave up reading.   Jamie Fraser is hero with whom no living man can compare.  He is at once a fierce, courageous, protective warrior and yet a passionate, tender, sentimental and sensitive husband with a very engaging sense of humor to boot and you just can't get enough of him and his fiesty,bold, smart wife Claire.  Jamie's love for Claire is so selflesss and unconditional that it is at times heartbreaking.  I found the scene where he takes Claire back to the standing stones (thinking that she wants to return to her own time and that it's not safe for her to remain in the 17th century) so touching that I cried.  He explains later that he prayed all the way up that hill; not for her to stay, because that wouldn't have been right.  Instead, He prayed for the strength not to fall on his knees and beg her to stay.   Even my husband enjoys the book.  He hasn't finished Outlander yet, but is already talking about reading some of the others. Although the ending of Outlander is disburbing and upsetting, it does not diminsh the book in any wary --rather it adds to it. I've come to realize that the plot twists at the end of her books are a technique of Diana's--just when you think everyhing is fine and we're going to have a happily ever after, Diana pulls the rug out from under your feet and the characters experience some (often life threatening) disaster which they must surmount; sometimes it's more than one disaster in succession.  It keeps you excitedly turning pages up to the very last page.   I find Outlander the best of the series, then Voyager and then Breath of Snow and Ashes, although each one is a very good novel capable of standing on its own; none of them disappoint.    It is an insult to Diana Gabaldon to classify this as a "romance" novel just because it does have some romance in it among the other plot themes.  I think historical/action adventure would be more accurate.  It is so much more than others of the romance genre.  I'm afraid she has ruined me for other authors.  I picked up a couple of other novels to read while I'm waiting for Diana's next installment in the series (due in 2-3 years) and nothing else quite compares.   Write faster, Diana!  Write Faster 
 By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased. I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results. I can now say that I have found it. I bought the 2" Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair. One of my all time, favorite purchases. I never travel without it 
 I think that the Sally Lockheart books are the most amazing books that I have ever read by far. The characters seem so real to me that I was actually CRYING when Frederick died in the second book. I am now half way through the third book and am again totally hooked. I take on board that the characters may not fit in totally with reality in the 1800's but that just makes, in my opinion, the books even better. The in depth thrill and pace of these books are so amazing, that it just makes me want to go out and wright a fifth! I must applaud Philip Pulman on these books, a masterpiece in my eyes, certainly the best books ever written by him, possiably by anyone ever 
 This is a family movie, set in the year 1919 - Montana wilderness, with a good story about lessons learned by the youngest member (supposed to be 17 years) of a summer forest ranger.  Sam Elliott plays a great role as usual, and a young Jerry O'Connell is entertaining as he meets the tests, while learning the importance of honor, trust, and integrity. I think this was a made for TV movie, based on the production, with fade outs, which seem to be placed for commercials.  Good vision and sound transfer.  This is a full screen movie, but does not look stretched on my widescreen.  This does have 5.1 sound, but there are no surround sound values noted.    I picked up this movie at a local discount store for 1/2 the on line price 
 This record was put together with songs that were on the British version of past records, B sides and a couple knock down, drag out hits. By the time this record came out the Stones had taken the world by Storm. Girls were screaming at their concerts, guys too, I'm told. But then how can you possible hold it in when Mick's on stage shouting out "Satisfaction." Boy I know I'd've been a screaming, wetting my panties too. "Big Hits" opens with "Satisfaction," ends with "Play with Fire" and every song between is a gem, especially their cover of Bobby Womack's "It's All Over Now." I've said it before, I'll say it again, you can't go wrong with the Rolling Stones, they come with Satisfaction Guaranteed 
 This was a very good movie --- other than some of the language used it was very moving - 
 Doerksen uncovers the fascinating yet neglected histories of the independent stations that operated in the dawn of radio broadcasting.  He details their (sometimes) humorous battles with the corporate players and the Federal Radio Commission and the ultimate demise of these stations under re-written rules and "consolidation".  I was surprised to learn that it was the populist stations -broadcasting hillbilly music or vaudeville acts or ultraconservative diatribes or "smutty jazz"-- who pushed broadcast advertising, not the "Big Four" corporations or the advertising industry.  A concise and easy read. 
 Living in the US, I've only seen a handful of Kylie's videos. (In fact, 25 of the 31 clips here are new to me.) Therefore, this is a welcome addition to the DVD collection. Here we see Kylie go from '80s pop princess to '90s serious chanteuse (a thankfully brief turn) to nouveau-disco diva of the aughts. This disc is fun from beginning to end, the sound is fine, and most of the video transfers are quite good (although some of the earlier stuff seems a bit washed out). All-in-all an excellent purchase, and the videos coupled with the "Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head" performance leave me wanting her live DVDs now 
 If your company gives or circulates this book. Update your resumes...layoff are not far behind (less than 6 months). Five months after they (my last company) circulated this book through IT, they laid off 30 of us.  Don't be fooled, the book is a ruse to prep your mind for 'change' 
 I totally agree with those of you who are upset over the fact that this is not a "true" adaptation of Vonnegut's novel.  When I first watched this movie I was expecting something a little truer to the original story, but once it started I realized that was not in the cards. So, I decided to turn my brain off and take this movie for what it is, entertainment. I have gone back and watched it since then, and still find it an enjoyable bit of fluff.  I thought Willis did a wonderful job portraying a man who is losing his mind. Albert Finney was a very admirable Kilgore Trout, and Nick Nolte stole the show with his portrayal of Henry Le Sabre.   I have read all of Vonnegut's wonderful novels, and am very pleased whenever someone decides to adapt one into film. Many fans may not be pleased with this particular piece, and in response to that I would refer them to Slaughterhouse-Five, and Mother Night. As for this flick goes, watch it for the drawings 
 As a life coach specializing in helping people get what they want, I find one of the biggest obstacles people experience is KNOWING what they want.  Or daring to admit what they want.    Martha's book walks people through that scary place, and she does it with compassion, expertise and incisive humor.  If you're wondering what life has in store for you, questioning where your joy and happiness is hiding, Martha will help you find it.  This is one of two books I recommend most highly to clients in my private practice.    Jeannette Maw, Good Vibe Coaching Salt Lake City, Uta 
 I enjoyed the characters in this book. I loved the feelings you got from Sarah. And felt her feelings of just sticking with something because you don't want to rock the boat in case there isn't anything better for you! Moving on can be a scary spot to be in 
 I have heard Adam Kahane speak twice, both memorable experience. The book provides the same insights in remarkably practical form.  Adam's work has helped me, and many I have shared his insights with, to listen more opening and to understand and apply the communication form best suited to the moment and need. If you wonder why telling doesn't work, and debating goes no where you won't be disappointed in this short, clear rea 
 This was a quick and involvng read for me.  It got me to thinking about changes of all kinds in a more positive light.  I would recommend this to anyone going through anything that seems like upheaval--whether it's divorce, job change, etc.  It can help you to change your thinking from  disaster to great opportunity that was meant to be 
 I purchased this book with the sole purpose of understanding sail theory, with an very distant goal of one day making my own sail.  The book is written in a very understanding manner, and explains more complex procedures in a precise and encouraging manner.  The book introdues you to the tools and procedures through making a small bag to carry your tools.  This is a great book for the money, and I highly encourage anyone wanting to learn about the different procedures for making various sail configurations.  However wonderful this book is, I would not recommend it if you are wanting to build your own high-performance sails, as it is geared towards sailing in a more relaxed and functional manner.   I found the book particularly good at explaining different sail functions, options, and layouts.  It also greatly clarified the principal of CE 
 This makes a nice companion piece to the movie Zulu.  Released after Zulu, this movie is never the less a prequel.  Both movies are stand alone, so it is not imperative to see one or the other before viewing either.  A first rate cast and African scenery makes this a winner.  Though there seems to be a bit of an anti-British undercurrent, the movie has only a few historical inaccuracies.  The British did make a mistake, and sadly for the men involved, it resulted in the greatest defeat of a modern army by a tribal force.  Incredible battle scenes make this a must 
 Deep. Thought provoking. Loved the slow speed roll through the midwestern countryside accompanied by violin 
 This bar is great when used properly, i.e. make sure the door is closed when you use it.  I was surprised how well it worked, much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches.  
 This is a film that will stay with you for years to come.  I had read some online reviews about how good of a film it was-so I decided to watch it-and I was shocked.  I have never seen pedophilia dealt with in such a way especially the results it has on its victims. This movie is VERY GRAPHIC so do not let children watch this film.  Also if you're easily offended by detailed descriptions of molestation do not watch!  But otherwise I have told everyone I know what an amazing movie this is, and I am getting ready to read the book.  If you're not offended by the things I mentioned --watch this movie.  You will never forget it 
 this sound track is very well done especilly like the little guiter riff in the Lighthous 
 It succeeds as a literary piece regardless of your feeling about jazz as a musical form.  The book stands out in my mind as a total sensory experience;  I still carry images evoked in my mind through the magnificent  descriptions;  I can smell the liquor and cigarettes and hear the rasping  coughs behind the riffs of music.  I had never listened to jazz very often  before I read this book. Now the jazz station is a pre-programmed button on  my stereo.  Experience this book 
 The acting was a little over the "top",But if you are a Fantasy action fan, you would appreciate the scenes, the characters, and just the way it was done.It brings on a devote sensation that you will always remember.Not a bad cast.The music sounds like it was a last ditch effort to bring back the 70's.That's not bad thing though. The music was good 
 Stephen King has made another novel full of horror and suspense.  The biggest storm ever is about to hit a town called Little Tall Island in Maine. While this storm is occuring a strange gentleman named Andre Linoge stops to visit.  He walks up to a home owned by an old woman Martha Clarendon. Linoge charges in the old womans home and brutily murders her.  Later, he purposly lets the police department arrest him 
 I bought this for my husband who is a HUGE Journey fan. We saw the current incarnation of the band in St. Louis this summer, and I gotta' tell you...Steve Perry really made the band. Too bad they couldn't work things out. The video is about like you would expect for 1981. What a nostalgia trip to see the hair styles and clothes we wore back then. I can't even see an American Idol commercial without flashing back to Randy Jackson in tight pink spandex! 
 Very easy to understand.  The talking feature works very well.  We left ours in a cold car that was below the recommended temperature. The defib. voice instructed us how to get it functional again.  We are very pleased with the ease of operation 
 At last a book that address's the who, what, when, where, how and why of table settings, tableware and manners. Very sadly over the years etiquette, especially table has been flushed down the proverbial toilet. This is a must have reference book for any home; and, makes for a great engagement, housewarming or new apartment gift. There are two (2) hope chests sitting within the walls of our home; both have a copy of The Art of the Table. Upon receiving this book, my girls and I sat down and started to skim through it,two (2) hours later found us taking out the fine china, stemware and silver. We set both a formal and informal table. A memory I shall forever treasure. Suzanne Von Drachenfels thank you, for this great book.  
 Wonderfully informative and interesting book for anyone from Brooklyn or interested in the great borough 
 I thoroughly enjoyed all three novellas, particularly the Man Who Gave up His Name. Jim Harrison's writing through out this book is fantastic and very original. I highly recommend this book. It should be noted that this book is NOT the movie, and attempts to compare or critique the book by comparison with the movie is pointless. The movie was based on only one of the stories, and only bits of the story for that matter 
 This album is a delight - something rare for a foreign-language album that I can't even understand what is said!  But the sound is so full of passion and emotion - while still ranging from rock to soft pop.  Sigur Ros is one of those rare bands that can communicate in almost any language because the sound is one that seems universal.  This album is unique and is an excellent choice for a night of relaxation - it's worth checking out for sure 
 Great buy!  It is easy to use, fun, and helps motivate. 
 This tells a story of one's walk with Jesus.  I could relate all along.  Excellent small book 
 I bought this book in 1952 in a cabin which was claimed to be Robert Service home in Whitehorse Yukon Territory.     I can think of no other book which I have enjoyed more or has gotten me through some pretty tough  times.     His characters are so real one can almost touch them 
 Hard to phathom how this little doozy got started. So some college kids from Glasgow got together to put to music some penned up material from aspiring poet Stuart Murdoch, and the result was a very limited edition of about 1,000 vinyl copies of what became known as "Tigermilk". Usually this stuff gets a B+ by the instructor, is listened to a few times by family members and close friends of the 'band', then gets forgotten, and the students graduate and get real jobs or something. Hah, well, sometimes in the vast sea of college projects rises to the surface a creation that doesn't go away...or refuses to go away, as the case may be. Like the "Blair Witch" phenomenom, this quiet, unassuming set of 10 songs caught a wave -- a tidal wave so-to-speak -- and for its first few years of its existence, was spread mostly through word of mouth (and then through music file sharing programs, at least until more copies went into print) at an alarming rate. Why is that? What makes this record so special? Well, start with the opening song, "The State I Am In". This song begins with a faye acapella and lots of atmosphere...just Murdoch and a quiet accoustic guitar. The voice is delicate, but gripping, and the lyrics offer an intriguing puzzle that sucks you in at once. You could swear it was Nick Drake singing from beyond the grave. It virtually insists that, if you are to listen, you are to give it your full and undivided attention. And slowly enough you realize, this guy has something really important to say...passively perhaps, almost without consequence...but you can't help but think this could be your younger sibling or best friend that is suddenly opening their heart and soul to you. For instance, "The priest in the booth had a photographic memory for all he had heard. He took all of my sins, and he wrote a pocket novel called The State That I Am In. So I gave myself to God. There was a pregnant pause before He said ok. Now I spend my day turning tables round in Marks & Spencer's, they don't seem to mind". Doesn't seem like much, but to hear it softly sung and accompanied by a lovely melody that builds gradually before reaching a peak, hovering delightfully at its apex over a truly gorgeous chorus...it is with one quick listen (or maybe it was two?) that it becomes apparent this isn't some fiviolous group of punks smashing irrelevant notes together in their basement, driving their parents insane. This IS something special.  "Tigermilk" is bascially Stuart Murdoch's first solo album (ha ha). Sure, he has a backing accompaniment of five other band members who play various instruments and occassionally offer backing vocals and other contributions. But Murdoch writes, sings, and plays guitar in all ten tracks here...and that's a great thing really. His acute ideas for harmonizing stories of teen angst ("Expectations"), awkward character studies ("She's Losing It"), philosophical renderings ("I Could Be Dreaming") are obviously influenced from many different leanings (The Smiths, Field Mice, Love, Nick Drake, etc), but he combines them into a unique and refreshing approach that stands at odds with most contemporary music of its time -- mid-90s -- and at the same time inspires a host of twenty and thirty somethings...of all sorts of backgrounds...to hitch on for a ride into a world of escapism, perhaps even necessary isolationism. It is a big bad world out there after all, and where to go and seek shelter when you are a generation X'er (or Y'er), with all the expectations, pressures and sensory overload threatening to bury you under its weight? These guys know your anguish, certainly, and in turn offer you just the right recipe for sublime transcendental cravings. Listen to "I Could Be Dreaming" for instance...it has perhaps the most complex production of any song on the album, with instruments, mixings, and overdubs weaving a textured backdrop that fits seamlessly with the suggestive lyrics presented in a rambling, stream of conscious fashion so as to evoke our inner most desires -- those sames ones strangled by daily inhibitions, only to awaken during our reveries. (Why the song tails off into Isobel Campbell giving a recitation of several passages from the novel Rip Van Winkle, I have no idea, other than it's non-too-subtle tie into to the song's title, but it's loads of fun regardless). Or "We Rule The School", which contains excerpts from Panchebel's Canon, not to mention the most enchanting flute instrumental I've ever heard.  All tracks here are extremely well done, and don't sound anything like what you would expect from a group of inexperienced music students. They're clever, inventive, familiar yet crisp and new all at once. As sad as some of the themes are, the tunes are decidedly uplifting and toe-tapping in a majority of the cases (just listen to the pop giddyness of "You're Just A Baby", or the soaring instrumentation and vocals behind "My Wandering Days Are Over"). Other notables include "I Don't Love Anyone", which is arguably the most punkish B&S ever got....that is to say, not very. But even with this light-hearted dabble into the world of adolescent rebellion, it's done in a fashion that's instantly recognizable and complete with a sing-along chorus that is reminiscent of some of the best pop from the 60's. The only real odd-ball tune on here is "Electronic Renaissance", which is a stab at early 80s techno/synth pop. Just what the point of this was I'm not sure, but as much as it kind of disrupts the flow of the album, in retrospect it is still a well done tune that is just as good as anything Duran Duran gave us (okay, maybe it's not on the same level as "The Reflex", but it manages to work nevertheless).  Overall, a very impressive debut. The word-of-mouth success of Tigermilk thankfully led to the group's continuing efforts of translating Murdoch's songs and ideas into actual music. Who knew that their next project, after using more time to crispen the sound and further embellish the harmonies, would be one of the most memorable musical achievements of the last 15-20 years? 
 When I first started my business 13 years ago I didn't know the first thing about marketing. The book is divided into two parts, 50 things you can do that don't cost anything and 50 things that cost. This book was my bible and there were only 3 things that wouldn't work with my business.  My phone began to ring and my friends were impressed with my marketing skills. I didn't feel I had marketing skills. I just knew how to read and follow instructions. I highly recommend this book for anyone getting started or for anyone just wanting to jump start their business and see if there is anything that they could do and maybe aren't 
 Great insights of the skills, challenges, and rewards of Puerto Rican ball players 
 I have purchased the Conair and Hot Tools Ceramic Flat Irons in the past, and while they were both good, this is even better. It straightens my hair much quicker and is designed so that when you close the plates, you squeeze the handle and not the plates. No more burned fingers. I can wash my hair at night and wake up and flat iron my hair and it comes out stick straight. For all of you with naturally curly hair, you understand how difficult that is. I love this iron. It was worth spending the extra money on it. Oh, it also does a great job on the kinky hair close to the scalp. I wish I had known about this sooner 
 I learned arabic alphabet and I learned to read arabic in a week because of this book. It is easy to read and easy to understand. And What I like the most is that at the end of the book there is sourah al fatihah. Now I know how read and write sourah al fatihah 
  Works great on my S2IS, clicked on silver on main page but switched to black on order form, didn't notice this but I like the black anyway. Looks good with acc 
 There's a moment in "Robot Monster" where every first-time viewer is kin: a lizard with a fin glued to its back jumps onto another lizard, in what is meant to represent the titanic struggle of two dinosaurs.  Since this has nothing to do with anything that happened before, the novice can only watch in slack-jawed wonder, asking "What the...?" "Robot Monster" is awash with stunning moment likes this, which may be why the trailer boasts it is "baffling."  But there is the glimmer of a story. Earth has been devastated by aliens using the calcinator death ray.  The handful of survivors (and the planet's only hope) so far are immune to the ray, but are available through a viewscreen for regular taunting by the solitary Earthbound "Ro-Man" (his nom de guerre).  He in turn is regularly berated by "the leader of all Ro-Men," the "Great One," sort of a psychotic nanny type who blurts his orders from across the void of space.  We know it's space because of the dog food we see -- or are those asteroids? We know they're aliens because they sport gorilla-suit bodies, and  diving helmets topped with antennae.  They speak always while flailing their bulky simian arms, and in booming, stentorian threats, virtually every utterance a quotable gem. This lends a vaguely Shakespearian tone to the proceedings. The Great One harps on the Earth Ro-Man to finish the job, while waving a violin bow.  Ro-Man is willing to kill everyone in the protected compound, but something new and mysterious stirs in him when he views the professor's daughter, Al-Ice (as Ro-Man says it).  This becomes one of the dramatic conflicts, and inspires the invader's touching, burbled soliloquy:  "Yes!  To be like the Hu-Man!  To laugh, to feel, to want.  Why is this not in the Plan?...Where on the graph do 'must' and 'cannot' meet?  I must, yet I cannot." There's something compelling in all this; even my young, impressionable kids have enjoyed it several times.   Every actor has something dazzlingly silly to say in all seriousness.  How many movies offer a monster that entertains just by ambling up and down scrub-covered hills?  "Robot Monster" is one film that will reward you just as much on the twentieth viewing as on the first.  Oh, and what about the lizards?  All is revealed in the end.   
 In "The Black Atlantic" Paul Gilroy constructs an excellent text based on the black diasporic experience. His views of black culture as being a dynamic networked construct based on the idea of the diaspora derived from Jewish culture, is an illuminating concept that contains great substance. Gilroy's underlying transnational humanism (that can be read in his latest pseudo-utopian work "Against Race") and vital rethinking about the perils of cultural nationalism and the urgent benefits of a unique hybrid culture is a thoroughly needed breath in the stasis of linear monocultural thinking. The book functions in an excellent manner in addressing the complex dynamics of slavery, colonization, and their inherent residual effects on black political culture. In addition the method in which Gilroy weaves Adorno, Hendrix, hip-hop culture, Du Bois, Wright, Hegel and a host of others in a clear and eloquent manner is cause for reading in itself. In a nutshell, this is a valuable sociological and philosophical work that creates a rupture in linear, absolutist views of history, sexuality, identity and other various elements in relation to black particularity. In this book Gilroy composes the dynamics of intercultural exchange (whether artistic, political, social, moral etc.) as well as attributing to socialized historical memory through its brilliant text 
 I absolutely love this book and highly recommended especially if you are newly diagnosed or new to post-secondary education. The book is actually more of a quick reference guide, the type you can carry around with you, and use on an as need basis. I myself keep it handy, and whenever a question, problem, or concern comes up related to ADHD and school I just pick it up and flip to the relevant section. This book is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of the ADHD post-secondary situation, but more of a pithy and portable help manual. I definitely recommend purchasing this book, even if it means giving up and evening of beer and pizza in order to afford the book, as it's well worth it 
 words cannot describe how this movie and music has touched my life. when i first heard about lees death i was shocked but coming to the realization that i might not see him in any more films came to this one. the soundtrack is purified to the brink of being probably the greatest soundtrack ever its has to intertwine with the movie and this does. raw voltage of energy and hard metal is the reason why this is a success. the cure , henry rollins rage and stp have made this album feel like your in the movie a great array of music combining with melody at the end. everyone should own this album a great tribute to brandon lee and the movie thats spawn it a cult classic 
 This book not only provides a detailed medical explanation of negative impacts of stress on your body, but also does a great job of explaining how to reverse it....the relaxation response.  Several methods for evoking the relaxation response are included and I have found the most success with counting my breath.  I have used this at home and in several stressful public situations (airport, mall, etc).  Breathing is key 
 Wondering what Brealy & Myers or Sharpe left out?  Don't expect your broker (or fund manager, excepting Richard Thaler) to fill you in.  This book is a must read for any active (or passive) participant in the markets, or any other citizen who is affected by said markets.  Meaning all of us.  Shefrin provides a masterful exposition of the application of cutting-edge cognitive psychology to the behavior of retail and institutional investors, analysts, mutual fund managers, CEO's and even heavily-advised university investment committees.  The  result is the theoretical demolition of the efficient markets hypothesis in even its weakest form, and the related CAPM(s), catching up to their long-noted empirical failings.  As it turns out the market does have a memory, and that's not just an anomaly any more.  Not every trade is zero-NPV: trust the market price at your own peril.  Think dividends are irrelevant?  Think again.  What we're left with is a fascinating account of how market participants actually behave: holding on to losers too long, trading too much and trading on "noise," and most alarmingly, undersaving for retirement.  What is significant is that these phenomena are so prevalent that they can no longer be dismissed  as irrational with the hope that "more sophisticated" money will magically correct the market.  To the contrary, what Shefrin describes is proved to be the psychological norm; if you believe you're different, you're either very lucky or overconfident about your lack of overconfidence.  One quibble, in an area that I have looked at before, is in Shefrin's discussion of takeovers.  First, I found a bit of confusion between the question of whether the takeover premium should be tested by reference to the post-announcement combined value of both firms, or just the buyer. Since the buyer's CEO is initially fiduciary for just his shareholders, I see only the latter as relevant.  More significantly, Shefrin does not provide any means to rigorously discriminate among his hubris hypothesis and other, more rationalistic theories, such as agency costs and private benefits.  And his brief treatment omits many puzzling follow-up questions: if CEO psychology has the potential to systematically destroy shareholder wealth, what should we then conclude about the investors and analysts who allow them to get away with it?  Just a governance problem, or is there yet another psychological story to be told?  But the desire to delve further into the subject is just indicative of Shefrin's compelling and readable narrative.  For bottom line types, I'm afraid the answer to your question is no, he doesn't explain how to get rich.  But you'll surely do alot better with a single yellowing copy of Graham & Dodd than all the reams of abstruse, dogmatic journal articles ever spewed by the Chicago School.               
 My mother always told me you got TB from drinking Raw Milk. Well this is not only incorrect it is also biologically impossible. There are many other inconsistancies as well and Ron Schmid addresses them one by one.  The book prompted me to do some research and I have come to the conclusion that we consumers are not getting the best deal. Unfortunately in my country it is illegal to sell raw milk. I think that's a shame. I would like the freedom to choose. Thank you Ron Schmid for putting the record straight 
 I agree with other reviews. The flats are made of really good quality leather, therefore thin. I have never seen such a beautiful insole. They scruff easily (no holes in mine yet) and the biggest design flow is the elastic, though it gets less painful with longer wear.   If you are willing to tolerate pain for a very compact, cute and flexible pair of shoes, these are great to take along on trips or keep at work to change into; they look great and go with everything. I generally never go for suffering, but these particular shoes compensate 
 About this time last year I listened to Andrew Hill for the first time on Point of Departure. Since then I've acquired Black Fire, Smokestack, Judgment, Andrew, Bobby Hutcherson's Dialogue, Dusk, and Beautiful Day. When I heard this was to be released, I picked it up the day it was out a week ago today. Timelines may be the most intriguing album I've heard... from any artist.   At midnight, driving home from Cheapo I had to pull over to take in the achingly beautiful Malachi. I shut off the engine and listened to the rest with an open mind. I've listened all the way through it three times since. It's facinating to me how free sounding this group is with such complex forms. This is also my favorite playing of Greg Tardy, especially on clarinet.   Hill has always presented his music with sincerity a quality I admire most about him. He never seems to be emulating someone else or is "going for" this or that. I hope he continues playing and recording music. Andrew, play St. Paul, Artist's Quarter. I'll round up a crowd.  -Nathan 
 If you've ever been to Germany and been introduced to someone whose title was Professor Doctor Doctor Doctor and you were required not to smile as you listened to the introduction, this is your book.  Academics in general take themselves too seriously, and Alexander McCall Smith draws on his years of experience in academia to lampoon the worst excesses.    The humor is rather broad and obvious, but it does hit the mark.  Those who aren't exposed to academics may wonder what all of the fuss is about.    These are a series of eight stories about Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld (think hedgehog field) and his colleagues.  With enormous self-confidence, the three professors decide to learn tennis by reading a book in the Principles of Tennis.  Von Igelfeld launches his fellow student and future colleague into a dangerous form of sport with humorous and unexpected consequences in Duels, and How to Fight Them.  Early Irish Pornography shows the potential absurdity of studying just any old language if you are a philologist.  Italian Matters explores the bases of national prejudices.  Portuguese Irregular Verbs explores the immense over-investment that all authors have in their work.  Holy Man explores how the rational man meets the mystic and what he makes of the experience.  Dental Pain looks into professorial romantic ideas.  Death in Venice tickles one's fancy with references to Thomas Mann.    If you like the Botswana stories, these stories will probably not appeal as much.  There's bile and vague pity beneath the humor here rather than love for the characters 
 When I read this book I thought it was like any other girl help book but this one was different. I used to be shy but now I am strong and have confidence in myself. I used to be a tad overweight but now I am at my  comfortable weight w/ a lifetime of healthy eating ahead of me. I also  learned the appropriate way to exercise w/o strain. It was a very good book  and I think I've read it over about 12 times now.I recommended it to all my  friends and they said it was the best book they have read 
 As the oldest child of parents who were divorced multiple times from multiple partners I found this book a remarkably accurate review of the effects of divorce on children.    It is comforting to observe empirical observations - gathered over twenty-five years - combine to create a crushing weight of evidence which ratifies and supports personal experience.  It is liberating to finally see that case study after case study suggests that there are reasons for feeling the way you do when you've been through the grinder of divorce.  If you want to know the legacy divorce will leave your children, read this book.  If you want to understand your own feelings as a child of divorce, read this book.     By finding your own experiences affirmed and amplified in the many case studies found in the book you will begin to find ways to break the chain of selfishness and pride that kills a good marriage. It may help you avoid passing this legacy of pain on to your own children.    This book should be required reading for for any child of divorce and/or the parent who wants to understand the mayhem they will be loosing in the lives of their children as they divorce. 
 Book is excellent.  It's full of great tips and information, and I really liked the format and informal style of the book.  I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone thinking of traveling to the Grand Canyon 
     After having read all three of the Agnes Browne Trilogy; The Mammy,The Chisellers and The Granny,I thoight that would be the end of O'Carroll's books about life in the Jarro and in the markets of Moore Street.  Well,let me tell you,O'Carroll hasn't run out of stories,and for my money this is his best yet  It is not often that I read a book that makes me laugh out loud,but this one did-and many times.  As Malachy McCourt,brother of Frank McCourt,says,"You will laugh your arse off and your tears will do away with your water-retention problem."  That about says it all!!  When can we expect a movie? It's sure to be a winner 
 Author Karen Halttunen does an excellent job in her study of 19th Century Middle Class Culture in America. CONFIDENCE MEN AND PAINTED WOMEN is a must for both scholars and living historians alike. Halttunen's work vividly details the social and cultural development of 19th Century Middle Class America, their etiquette, values and mores. Taken from etiquette books, manuals and magazines of the era, Halttunen's study covers the sentimental culture of fashion, etiquette, hypocrisy of the time and even mourning the dead. She focuses on the time period of 1830-1870. Halttunen has really done her homework on this topic, and she gives new insight to a bygone era.   
 If you like stupid funny, this is the movie for you.  We love it.  I imagine people who like Nacho Libre, Napoleon Dynamite, Waking Ned Divine (not as stupid funny as the others), etc would like this one too 
 I enjoyed this beautiful and haunting volume as a compilation of letters and diary entries of the Imperial family of Russia. The passion of Niocholas and Alexandra is revealed in all of its grandeur. One glimpses the troubled marriage and love affair of the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia, as well as the struggles of conscience of Nicholas' cousin, KR. This book is an excellent supplement for someone already familiar with the family's tragic story, and adds a whole new dimension of comprehension 
 I just finished reading this book yesterday.  I LOVED IT!  Octavia never lets me down when it comes to a satisfying story.  I love vampire stories and Ms. Butler and having the two come together is beyond wonderful.  It's a shame that Ms. Butler is no longer here with us; I would have loved to read more about Shori and her syms.    This book is a winner; worth the purchase 
 This is a good road movie, I really enjoyed it. What makes this movie good is without a doubt the great acting from its two stars. Susan Sarandon and Stephen Dorff are excellent in their roles as kidnapper and hostage. The movie is also funny at times and very serious at times which I really like. Stephen Dorff is a very good actor and if he keeps doing roles like this one he could very easily follow in the steps of Johnny Depp which is one of my favorite actors. Susan Sarandon is always good and this film is really worth the time again the acting is excellent and is the reason to see this movie 
 I believe this book is an insightful tool for any manager's library.  He gives a clear understanding of what it is like to be an employee and ultimately a manager.  The tools he learned along the way and is incorporating into SRC are invaluable to the success of an organization.  I have toured SRC and talked with the employees and they are his biggest advocates.  That says it all 
 This book is essential for any seaker who wants to stop the search and "find". Gangaji shares with brilliant clarity what she has discovered at the end of the journey. With lots of compassion her writing gives answers to the most frequent questions among seakers. With a steady hand she guides the reader through and beyond doubts and misunderstandings. A shear deligth to read and read again and again. 
 What can you say?  Every song on this CD is great 
 A Must for any Intelligent Person, Family or Library. Remember Innocence? The Fantasy Sequence is very "Period"(the 50s) , but worth every penny 
 Makes a little tick tick tick noise but overall as described and nice and small. cant beat the pric 
 This hallucinating, provocative and irreverent script had to come from England: the nest of so many and not least brilliant gems in the recent past. Films of the stature of Pygmalion, The importance of being Ernest (adapted from Shaw and Wilde respectively), Kind hearts and cornets, The Lavender Hill Mob, Lady killers,  Hobson's choice, Whisky Gallore - delighted and still make it laugh - to several generations and carried as flower and its fruit the germinal seed of the Monthy Phyton in the seventies. The severe underemployment crisis leads to these men to create a very original way to face his financial problems.  This film to my mind was the best  Comedy in the Nineties, sharing honors with Delicatessen. Full laughs! Don't miss it.    
 Not many children's books involve a scene in which the title character's head is eaten.  But then, not many children's books are "Miss Hickory".  The 1947 Newbery winner, "Miss Hickory" belongs strictly to that amazingly popular genre of what-mischief-do-our-dolls-get-up-to-when-we're-not-around books.  Only in this case, the doll is not one of your fancy china creations or a Victorian lady but rather a New England creature of humble origins.  She has the body of an applewood twig and the head of a hickory nut.  And that's just the beginning of the peculiarities found in this (sometimes) little read tale.  If you want a Newbery winner that appeals to those kids that like dolls, nature, or a little bit of both then you're in for a surprising treat.  Meet Miss Hickory.  A small doll living out her days in a corncob house, she has a happy little existence keeping to herself and not bothering anyone.  When her gossipy Crow friend informs her that the family with whom she often spends her winters indoors is leaving the countryside without her, Miss Hickory is loathe to believe it.  Further confirmation on the part of the cat Mr. T. Willard-Brown finally forces her to face up to the facts, whereupon she swiftly plunges into a deep pit of woe and self-pity.  Fortunately for her, Crow finds Miss Hickory a warm nest of a shelter in which she can live out the cold winter months and because of this she is able to interact sociably with the other animals that live in the area.  There's the peacable doe who's mother is killed and who hooks up with a wild heifer.  There's a naughty squirrel who keeps eyeing Miss Hickory's noggin as a potential food source... but only jokingly, right?  There's the downtrodden hen-pheasant (described in the cast of characters as "sad and without pep") who gets pushed around by her husband.  And there's a groundhog who's unnatural fear of his own shadow causes a great deal of ruckus.  By the end of the tale, Miss Hickory learns a little about her own personal flaws and transforms herself into an entirely different entity so as to better serve the children that return to the farmhouse.  Unlike a previous Newbery winning doll book character (Hitty from "Hitty: Her First One Hundred Years"), Miss Hickory is not your standard oh-me-oh-my heroine.  Because her head is so hard she often finds herself being mean, stubborn, or unyielding to things that might cause her a lot of pleasure if she let them.  This flaw in her personality is remedied in a somewhat drastic way that I, frankly, really enjoyed.  This book is also full of little odd turns of phrase that catch the reader's ear.  When the squirrel takes his first look at a newly dandied up Miss Hickory, his immediate reaction is a kind of macho, "Hi, cutie!".  And when Miss Hickory views the lead crow of a mob she thinks to herself, "Undoubtedly a gangster.... He ought to be shot, but they'll never catch him".  I'm a fan of the unexpppected bit of fun in older children's books and this particular story has unexpected fun hither and thither.    There are some odd choices in the book, though.  This story has a blatent Christian Christmas miracle scene that may make not make much sense to those child readers not raised on Christmas Eve tales since birth.  And the whole hen-pheasant being dutiful to her awful husband is a bit dated today.  One suspects a kid reading such sections would wonder why the brow beaten hen doesn't just leave her husband and stay with the other lady hen-pheasants instead.  It's worth wondering.  Still, the book overcomes this dated features and continues to be a good tale.  Though this is probably not one of the better remembered Newbery Award winning books (more's the pity for it), "Miss Hickory" is well worth reading.  A fun, sly, knowing little piece of work with an unconventional ending, it's sure to win as many fans today as it did in 1947.  A lovely little book 
 Mort is apprenticed to Death at a job fair, because frankly he's so klutzy no one else wants him, not even his farmer father.  Now Death has a voice like "lead slabs dropped on granite" and He strides toward Mort, "black cloak billowing and feet making little clicking sounds on the cobbles."  Unfortunately He spoils His entrance by slipping on a patch of ice, and collapsing at His would-be apprentice's feet.  For some reason, Mort is not afraid of Death.  He thinks He's weird and fascinating.  Plus his father has told him that some hard-working apprentices inherit their master's business.  Ummm...  Maybe not if your Master is immortal.  Mort is soon sent out on his own to 'release' dying souls from their bodies, and (this is the best part) he gets to ride Death's big white horse, Binky.  He gallops to his first location, a small cottage, and finds a bundle of hay by the door with an attached note:  "FOR THEE HORS."  Someone is expecting him.  "Mort" is full of strange and hilarious encounters between the world's most naïve apprentice and his sometimes unwilling customers.  And just when he's beginning to get the swing of things, i.e. his sythe, he meets Princess Keli who is about to be assassinated in her own royal bedroom.  Mort saves her life--a huge no-no on the list of things Death's apprentice should never do.  He and Princess Keli have got to work on her not-really-dead-but-not-really-alive predicament together, even if it means that Mort will have to fight a life-or-Death duel with his master.  Luckily, Death's daughter, Ysabell (Disworld's first goth, although a bit chubby for the part) has taken a liking to Mort.  With Binky, Ysabell, and Albert (Death's valet) on his side, will Mort have a chance against the Destroyer of Worlds?  WHAT DO YOU THINK? HA HA HA HA HA! 
 What a superb short novel this is!  The characters are memorable, even unforgettable, and the "message" is one which time will never forget: spoiling a child is NO WAY of raising that child.  The novel begins with our introduction to a super-rich, spoiled brat: a cynic who "knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing."  Fate comes along and knocks the kid off of his luxury-liner, and into the deep, cold watery ocean of reality.  There he makes friends, and learns the meaning of work, and grows from a very ugly duckling into a worthwhile, even admirable young man, before our eyes.  The book is filled with nautical terms which I do not understand, and dialect as well.  Rudyard Kipling loved the English language, and he loved exploring the world.  To answer the complaint of one reviewer, who said:  "For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown. Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night. Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"   The "translation" runs as follows: the "boat" (the main ship) carried a number of small "dories" which are used for fishing -- while the main ship is used for processing the fish.  So Dan's reply is simple: "We can always fish from the boat, until we begin processing the fish -- and then all the heads and offal spreading around the boat will scare the fish away.  Fishing from the boat is regarded as old-fashioned, unless you know as much as my Dad does.  I guess we'll put out our trawl tonight [fishing from the boat].  But it's harder on the back than fishing from the dories, isn't it?"  Kipling later explains this very clearly: hauling 20 pounds of fish from the ocean to the deck of a big ship requires pulling dead weight through (say) five or six feet, while fish caught into a dory are generally just flipped aboard.  Of course, understanding all this is a vital part of the young hero's education.  Modern, non-nautical readers can always adopt the time-honored practice of "skimming."  A really great book 
 A recent death in the family prompted me to examine my life to see what I should be doing differently. The answer, one of them anyway, was I should be reading more poetry. So I got this little gem of a book from Amazon and  read it through. Carl Sandburg was a master and one of the old time  American poets who spoke simply and directly so that each of us could  clearly understand. Fog is a typical example: The fog comes in on little  cat feet. It sits looking over harbor and city on silent haunches and then  moves on. Wow! If that sounds like great writing it is because it is. I  wish I could write a poem like that and I wish Chicago Poems would out sell  my own poem book because it has so much more to offer 
 I was wondering what she was going to do for a sequel.  Not sure I really like it since it was longer, slower and more boring.  She had a great idea but then it got a little bogged down. I'm not going to go into a plot summary since Amazon and other reviewers have done a better job than I could do.  I just really feel she could have cut some out of the middle and maybe expanded the end.  It ends very fast.  You can tell this is the middle book of the trilogy because most middle ones are used to explain some things.  I did enjoy the book though.  I love some of the plot twists.  I even enjoyed the sad parts.  Oh yes there are some sad parts but they were going to have to happen sooner or later.  I would recommend this book so you can enjoy the whole series.  It's worth the slow parts 
 I bought three copies of your book at Amazon and gave them as party gifts during private receptions. They were greatly appreciated.  It was in fact a very selfish gift: I have hopes that your book will help these people and stop them from calling me each time their system has a hiccup.  My friends overseas unfortunately are not fluent enough in English, their version of Windows is either French or German, otherwise I would already have shipped a couple of cases of your excellent book to get some peace in my Inbox 
 I know Amazon says this is a book for 9-12 year olds but I'm older and I loved it. I started reading the Heartland books in like 5th grade but like now I really think this is a book that people my age would enjoy. However, if you haven't read at least the last five books first it won't mean as much to you. I am one of those people that isn't really sensitive and has never cried in a book before but this book made me cry. Everyone should read this book! It's fantastic 
 UNA GRABACIN SIN PRECEDENTES SOLAMENTE HACE QUE EL OYENTE QUE LA EST ESCUCHANDO EXPERIMENTE MENTALMENTE Y ANALICE LO QUE YA ELLOS COMO MSICOS GENIALES CREARON 
 What a treat to finally have the first season of "The Muppet Show" on DVD.  This was truly a milestone in family entertainment, a program that pleased young and old alike.  I had forgotten many of the eary episodes and was thrilled to see Juliet Prowse, Joel Grey, Connie Stevens and others singing and dancing with the Muppet Gang.  While Kermit ruled this plush mob, Miss Piggy quickly stole the show with her solo performance on "Temptation."  Later, in episode two, Miss Piggy takes amusing offense to Kermit's interest in Lydia, the tattooed lady. You can go to Kermitage to get a rundown on all the episodes.    Jim Henson's first Muppet creations were seen in 1954 and over the years they evolved into an incredible menagerie of characters, populating both Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.  Kermit and the gang even made it on a series of US stamps honoring Jim Henson.  However, it was The Muppet Show which really took the cake in my mind.  The writing and skits are so much fun, and can be seen over and over again, delighting new generations, like that of my five-year-old daughter.  There have been several "Best of" DVD's, but I am so glad that Disney is finally releasing these DVD's in season box sets.   
 I  enjoyed reading this book. It  spoke to a part of me that knows that there are rhythms to life. It shows us that we need not be up and sparkling all the time, that there is a time for feeling empty and receptive to the  world around us. It is a book that covers a wide range of topics from Feng  Shui to Rolfing. I would recommend it 
 Tom Morris has done it again!  His latest book, If Harry Potter Ran General Electric, is an inexpensive means of obtaining Morris's great wisdom.  It is likely that Tom Morris will join the ranks of the great stoics.  No wonder the book has already hit a couple of bestseller lists, including the Wall Street Journal List!  Those who thought the Harry Potter books are unfit for their children to read should see Morris' take on the books.  Where some think only of the trickery of witchcraft and magic, Morris looks at the wisdom, character, and the morality to be gained from reading Rowling's works.  It is a study that would make a better corporate environment for anyone who implemented Morris' lessons into their work and everyday life.  Morris touches just about every realm of the human mind with clarity.  He takes into account the bad with the good and suggests a means of turning the bad into good scenarios.  My mother used to say, "Be a problem solver, not a problem maker".  Apparently, Tom Morris and JK Rowling had some of the same type of education from their parents.  This book ranks six stars out of a field of five stars.  Every board room in the world should have it available to their management personnel.  It is a real winner.  Don't miss out! 
 Most writers write about Our Crowd.  Bell writes about the furthest possible crowd from our crowd.  Then he gets inside their heads and gives you real-time thought.  This time he did so in a far richer manner than before, with a wealth of detail, not only of their observations, reactions and decisions, but also of their distractions and discomforts.  I look forward to the third of this trilogy, covering 1801-2.  The Haitian revolution and its genius Toussaint Louverture make an epic unique in history, and Bell gives the epic the real-time richness it merits 
 Following his previous great works Gardner has crystalised some of his more controversial ideas of the origins of some tales of Goth. Aptly termed realm of the ring lords, this book begins with the intriguing offer on the possible historical truth of the Lord of the rings trilogy.Ever wondered why stories of goblins and fairies persist? Here you get the answers you always wanted. As you read further you will find startling revelations of the origins of dracula. werewolves etc . Certainly I have found this genre difficult to defend but Gardner as usual delivers tempting evidence of his theories. Readers of his previous books will appreciate this edition if only for the mythical slant taken 
 Mary Manin Morrissey is a mature and wise voice in the sea of spiritual writers and lecturers. Ms. Morrissey captures the essence of moving from a thought system based on self/ego to a thought system based on love. If you follow the work of Marianne Willamson or Carolynn Myss, you will recognize thoughts and principles. This book was an unexpected gift 
 When our 9yo nephew opened this gift for Christmas his response was, "OH COOL!".  That about says it all.  
 I read Owls in the Family to my second and third grade class last year and they loved it.  There were a lot of funny situations as a young boy tries to win a prize in the pet parade with his owls.  It is realistic as well humorous and kids can learn a lot about owls and their interaction with other animals like dogs,gophers, rats, snakes. Ii is set in a small town in Canada in a time when parents could let their children explore the town and surrounding wilderness without worrying about kidnappers and gangs.   It is a recommended read aloud for grades 2-6 in Jim Trelease's book "The Read Aloud Handbook. 
 I was inspired to watch "To Have and Have Not" by to reasons: Humphrey Bogart was always one of my favorite actors of Golden Age and also after reading an amazing book by Lauren Bacall " By myself and Some More".  The movie shows a great chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, the good actors can always convince us that there is chemistry, but when it's the real thing it is something different. "To Have and Have Not" is the starting point of one of the most romantic relationships in Old Hollywood.  Movie has great humour, some lines are hilarious, and leaves you cheered up. My only regret that it is a bit too short!    
 OK, I just had to come up with some stupid pun for my title. Sorry. Anyway, this set is well worth the money. While the rest of the movies are hit-and-miss, Thumb Wars, Thumbtanic, and The Godthumb are instant classics. All it really takes to enjoy any one of these shorts is a basic knowledge of the film they are parodying (if that's not already a word, it is now). More extensive knowledge of the film allows the viewer to pick up on the subtler details of the shorts, details that are well thought-out and sure to provide the well-versed audience with a laugh or two. The variety of the shorts in the box set ensures that almost anyone will be able to sit down and enjoy at least one of these shorts, and for the price at which they are offered, I highly recommend this set 
 a nice intro to hoxsey, his clinic(s), and his treatment; valuable to all, from cancer patients(as an intro tool when deciding on treatment) to health care professionals(& especially those still in training/school who haven't been polarized to an allopathic-only mindset). This video came before the (thick) bk, When Healing Becomes a Crime (which is a virtual treasure trove of cancer/treatment info, not just historical or hoxsey specific; highly recommend that you read the bk), and the video is a synopsis of the heart of the bk, minus later history/studies/otherTreatments. I learned of the video via the bk, which is actually one of my textbooks for the class "Cancer: Prevention and Politics," within my natural health degree program 
 My Daughter says this book was good and held her interest.  
 Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying "Truth is stranger than fiction" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments 
 The national socialists or known as Nasdp (National Socialist Deutsche Partei) once led by the founder Anton Drexler) became the Nazis under the new leader Adolf Hiedler mispelled by a church pastor as Hitler. A wandering miller named Alois Hiedler was a physical abuser of his son Adolf,never liked that his son got involved in the arts and wanted to be a famous painter in Vienna. Adolf said "I would have been a car salesman if i was not the fuehrer of deutschland"   History proved otherwise instead of a car sales man Adolf became like his dad to the extreme. The only love of his life was his german shepard and war.   Hatred and violence and the almost genocide of the jewish people was hitler's plan from the beginning to the end of the third reich in 1945.   Today the anti-semitism, the violence, and the hatred of the nazis still continue today in the neo nazi movements like the badenmeinhof. The muslims have learned from their master hitler all to well. In germany recently the muslims had a big sign saying "Hitler was right".  tells any person that muslims are nazis. Hitler and his propaganda (lies) infiltrated into middle eastern arab policy and beliefs in the 1930's.   From what is going on no has learned the warning from history 
 This book is truly marvelous. It provides an easy and accessible way to introduce young children to the world of art, while leaving room to develop their own ideas and concepts concerning "classical art". I think as children grow they will continue to appreciate the beauty of the works they first met in this book and will have a point of reference that helps them relate to the works in the book 
 What a fun romp this Pinkwater book is!  The book starts out on a gloomy note, with the young protagonist, Ivan, resenting his parents' move to urban Hoboken.  Soon he finds 2 new best friends who assist him in sleuthing down a decades-old mystery.  The character sketches are rich, but the book is fast-paced and an easy read.  This would be a great read-aloud in a 2nd or 3rd grade classroom or a wonderful read-alone for 4th grade and up.  Looking for Bobowicz might also be used to inspire older grades in writing local lore adventures.  Librarians will especially enjoy the characterization of Starr Lackawanna, the librarian who helps the children solve the giant chicken phantom mystery.   
 I cannot rave enough about this book. I wandered into a gift shop in Jasper searching for a geological map, but no one knew what that was (I was offered topographic maps by the staff.) Finally, several gift shops later someone suggested this guide. I initially hesitated, since it was more then I had planned to spend. All I wanted was a brief outline of local geology, and I got so much more!  Absolutely fabulous! Entertaining, comprehensive, beautifully illustrated, authoritative and yet written with a sense of humour. I felt fully prepared to pick mushrooms, face bears, or lecture random hikers on the behaviour of gulls. Worth every penny! I am in awe of Mr. Gadd, and I thank him with all my heart for this gem of a book. 
 TRUE TO YOURSELF: LEADING A VALUES-BASED BUSINESS adds to others in 'The social Venture Network' series, but stands well alone as a detailed analysis of how to build the kind of organization which is both financially successful and a positive force on the planet. Ideals are fine - but how can one keep customers happy, have ideals, and keep the bottom line in the black, simultaneously? TRUE TO YOURSELF offers the author's own experiences as well as interviews with over seventy industry leaders who lend insights on issues of commitment, competence, and how to run a business.

 From "So Whatcha Sayin", to "Knick Knack Patty Wack", "The Big Payback", among others. This still remains a classic follow-up since their first debut titled STRICTLY BUSINESS. EPMD were the best rap group in hip-hop history period. I luv them since I was a little kid and I'm still a fan to them no matter what. If u're into Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane, Eric B. and Rakim, Gang Starr, Kool Moe Dee, Young MC, Tone Loc, The Sugarhill Gang, etc. you gotta have this. This sure is a kickout!  
 Music steeped in 60's/70's garage/psych rock and done with decent vocals. A great cd under this Canadian bands new name (formerly the datsons or the datson four, some thing to that effect)Pop music the way it is meant to be 
 I got the black belt with a white cross and a black buckle.  I really like this belt. I wear it with my paramedic pants. It is easy to adjust the size, and it looks great with my black pants and white shirt: my uniform. 
   I am glad that I finally got around to reading this collection of Campbell's lectures delivered between 1958 and 1971. Since they deal with eternal subject matter there is little chance of them being "dated." The common theme running through them all is the deep power of myth on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages. This includes our own age, whether we personally want to admit or recognize it.  The Lectures include: 1)  The Impact of Science on Myth (1961), 2)  The Emergence of Mankind (1966), 3)  The Importance of Rites (1964), 4)  The Separation of East and West (1961), 5)  The Confrontation of East and West in Religion (1970) 6)  The Inspiration of Oriental Art (1958), 7)  Zen (1969), 8)  The Mythology of Love (1967), 9)  Mythologies of War and Peace (1967), 10) Schizophrenia- the Inward Journey (1970), 11) The Moon Walk- The Outer Journey (1970), 12) Envoy: No More Horizons (1971),    The reader will recognize much of the subject matter from the later talks with Bill Moyers in the "Power of Myth" series. All in all there is enough material covered to make this an excellent introduction to myth, true spirituality, and depth psychology.    One of the topics that stuck with me was the fundamental difference in the nature of religion in the East, the Near East, and the West. Traditional Eastern societies were seen as governed by one great cosmic law through which all members were seen to draw their purpose, their worth, their meaning. God was in all things and the divine spark was in all individuals. Union with the divine was possible to those that transcended their ego. In the Near-East human beings (including the King) were seen as the groveling "tenant-farmers" of God. Men were the slaves of the Gods and could only beg and sacrifice to obtain boons. Man was in no way a part of God- matter and spirit were artificially split (mythic dissociation.) Finally, there was the Greek model- mankind as the rivals and competitors of the Gods. The Greek had turned ego into God, laying the foundation for the total denial of the very existence of spirit. That is, except for the initiates of the Mysteries....   There is a section of reference notes citing sources in the back of the book, as well as, a full index for quick reference.   
 Anne Lamott is a San Francisco Bay Area native down to the cellular level not only in her preferences, but in her political and social views. She is unabashedly a lefty, the daughter of lefties, and she want everyone to know it from page one of this volume, where she serves notice of her identity by beginning with a diatribe against George W. Bush and the war in Iraq.  She is saying, "Look, Sweetheart, this is who I am, so let's get this straight.  If you can't take it, then back up, close the front cover, and get the hell out of my book!"  I am one of the people who stayed, and glad I did.   Unlike her earlier "Traveling Mercies" which began with a sequential biography of her journey towards God, or perhaps His journey towards her, this book is a non-chronological collection of essays gently demonstrating the fragile yet invincible grace of God evident in the friendships, conflicts, disasters, and tangles of the human condition--her own, that of her teenage son Sam, those of her friends and family, those of her church, and the people she encounters as a lusty, narcissistic, radicalized leftist, mellowing with age, experience, and grace.   Lamott places a poem before Chapter One that subtly but unerringly foreshadows the them of this collection of twenty-four portraits of life and grace.  By Lisel Mueller, it is titled "Monet Refuses the Operation," and chronicles and contrast the painter's view of reality with that view defended by more "rational," less artistic people.  Of course, Lamott is Monet as well, and his words might as well be hers as he says, "The world is flux, and light becomes what it touches, becomes water, lilies on water, above and below water, becomes lilac and mauve and yellow and whilte and cerulean lamps, small fists passing sunlight so quickly to one another . . .""  The point is, the world is not simply what it seems, and as with Emily Dickinson' poem, "All the earth is crammed with heaven and every bush aflame with God, but only those who see take off their shoes."  Lamott sees. She sees the pain, the sorrow and the darkness, but she also sees the burning bush, and invites us to draw near and to take off our shoes and join her there.   It is obvious to me that she wants not only to sensitize us to how God moves amidst the ordinary, but also to comfort the wounded hearts of readers bruised by life, and longing for the soothing touch of God, whether they realize it or not.   Lamott succeeds in this without being preachy, superficial, or simplistic.    She never loses sight of life's ugliness, instead finding the grace of God shining brightest in the darkest places. "Without all the shades and shadows, you'd miss the beauty of the veil.  The shadow is always there, and if you don't remember it, when it falls on you and your life again, you're plunged into darkness. Shadows make the light show" (162).   This book is mellower than "Traveling Mercies," written five years later.  Here we see a Lamott coming to terms with her life, finally content, but still radical, still disturbed by life's injustices, still struggling.  But she is coming to terms with life as it is, and herself as she is, feeling just a little bit safer in the arms of God. She knows better than before the strength of the everlasting arms.   This is not a tightly organized book, but a collection of snapshots of life as she finds it.  Some people will be impatient with the gentleness of the book. She paints miniatures, not murals.  Nevertheless, upon her small canvases, she paints with great artistry and sensitivity.    Prepare to be changed in how you relate to older relatives, to the sick, to the downtrodden, to social justice issues, to undesirable tasks.   As for me, I was more than once moved almost to tears by her integrity and intensity of relationship with her son.  Her transparency enabled me to look more deeply at my own parenting. Of such glimpses, tears are born.   Anne Lamott teaches all of us here about how to live with ourselves, with God, and with each other.  Who can afford to miss the lesson?   
 I've gotten several beer brewing books from Amazon and decided to get this book on Mead because I like honey and wanted to learn something about making mead with it. I'd always heard about mead and was curious about it but if you're expecting a lot of recipes this book probably isn't for you. Mr. Schramm puts out a lot of information on the history, styles of meads, the science and ingredients. I'm not sure if it has enough information to go out and brew the stuff (I'm still reading the book and have never tried to brew anything)if you're a complete novice but it might do it. When Mr. Schramm titled the book complete he meant just that, only 2 or 3 recipes in the first 158 pages- the rest of it covering anything else you'd need or want to know (there is a 9 page recipe section late in the book). I liked the section on honey and other suppliers, 13 pages long and 9 of them cover mail order honey suppliers, the rest are for spices and other equipment. I may never get around to making Mead but if I do I'll be glad I've got this book 
 This is the best introduction to time management.  I believe one of the hallmarks of a good time management book is that one shouldn't have to spend a lot of time reading it.  This book is brief, concise, and just about every sentence is useful.  If you need to improve your time management skills start with this book.    Implementing just a few of the author's ideas will make your life more relaxed and enjoyable.  However, beware of attempting to implement all of his ideas at once; this is bound to overwhelm most people and you may end up quiting your attempt at time management.  Instead pick the top three or four suggestions the author makes, try them out for a few months, keep the ones that work for you, then read a little bit of the book again, pick some more ideas, try them out, and so on.  After some time your life will be much better off for implementing the ideas in this book that work best for you.  After incorporating some of the ideas in this book into your life, I highly suggest moving on to David Allen's "Getting Things Done. 
 From being friends, family members, and associates of several Greeks, there is much information in this book that I was already familiar with, but I still wanted to read it as a reference guide for my own publication.  And indeed, I'm so very glad that I did.  This book took an intelligent perspective on the pros and cons of being Greek.  The author discussed the history of stepping, a few interviews with nonBlacks who crossed, the heinous history of hazing, the complexity of the Board and advisers versus undergraduates in volunteer work and pledging, and a well-thought out idea on how hazing can stop, but the pledging process will still weed out the slackers and attention seekers.  The author spoke about the history, reputation, symbols, hand signals, and style of the Divine Nine (even when there were originally eight).  This book is indeed a great source to learn about the history of Black Greeks, and I applaud him for his hard work.  
 The author (Robert L. Park) doesn't actually joke about the wacky ideas that he explores, but I couldn't help laughing out loud during several parts of the book because of the absurdity that Park reveals.  At the same time, however, I found myself feeling disturbed by how so many people are decieved by the nonsense.  Park did an excellent job illustrating his points in such a way that the book was very easy to read.  This book is not a highly technical book that makes you reread sentences a few times before understanding them.  It was fun to read and very informative about the strangeness of wierd beliefs that circulate around me, what their origins appear to be, what their effects are, and also why they happen.  I don't usually reread books, but for this one I may do just that.  It was a pleasure from start to finish 
 Wore out the VHS and so updated to DVD.  Love this movie 
 this product was exactly what I had hoped for as i was coming across recipes that called for matcha powder. It worked perfect and makes an excellent cup of tea (a little goes a long way, i definately feel i got my moneys worth). Try it in panna cotta 
 The book was great. It arrived promptly and was in great shape 
 I've read several books on bread baking, including Reinhart's earlier Brother Juniper's Bread Book.  Ever since I found Crust and Crumb on my roommate's bookshelf, those other bread books have been gathering a lot of dust.  Perhaps the best quality of this cookbook is its almost poetic writing.  It's as enjoyable to read as many novels, and I've frequently passed time while waiting for a loaf to bake by rereading some of its more interesting passages.  The recipes themselves are incredible, especially the focaccia and the two varieties of pizza crust.  Better yet, Reinhart doesn't simply give you a recipe and expect you to follow it blindly.  He explains why bread works the way it does, and in doing so, he gives you all the tools you need to experiment on your own.  These days, many pages of my copy (well, technically, my poor roommate's copy) of Crust and Crumb are covered in scribbled writing suggesting ingredient modifications, different rising times to try, etc. -- not because there's anything wrong with the original recipes, but because Reinhart inspires experimentation.  And when such experiments produce yummy bread, who's gonna complain 
 When one thinks of Buddy Holly, Don Mclean's "American Pie" comes to mind, the day the music died.  But by listening to the two-cd disc, The Buddy Holly Collection, listeners can hear that his music is alive and well.  Holly is yet another musician who passed away at such a young age, 22, but he used his time wisely by producing a good dose of records that noticeably developed in such a short time.  Holly's music transcended popular music, especially during the 1950s, and his sound is distinct in that he not only possessed the twanging Fender guitar-oriented sound, but added piano and string arrangements, and rhythm and blues in a rock and roll song before they came into vogue during the 1960s.  The 60's had the music genius of the Beatles and Brian Wilson and the 50's had Buddy Holly.    The first few tracks of the first disc are covered with energy-driven rockabilly flair and Elvis-like vocals.  From the instrumental "Holly Hop," "Rock Around With Ollie Vee," and a rendition of Chuck Berry's "Brown Eyed Handsome Man," Buddy gets the listener's feet tapping.  However, it is his "That'll Be the Day" and "Peggy Sue" that many are familiar with.  But listening to his "Words of Love," one can see that Holly was indeed with the Beatles when they recorded their version on Beatles For Sale as well as "Crying, Waiting, Hoping" on their BBC live recording.    The second disc sounds the most timeless.  Several of the songs have a folk-like quality, "Well Alright" and "Wishing." "Think it Over" has the Buddy Holly hiccup-vocal trait and pounding piano solo.   And "Early in the Morning" is the most soulful track on the album, where Holly sings praise with intense energy and execution.  But the highlight of this disc thus far is the legendary and sentimental "True Love Ways."  In essence, Buddy Holly and his counterpart and influence, Elvis Presley, were the predecessors of rock and roll music, but Holly's contribution to this genre of music helped to influence young musicians.   Hence this is definitely a collection that all rock and roll fans should own as well as those who enjoy listening to how popular music has evolved.    
 We all know part of the story:  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall and a great fall.  But what really happened that fateful night?  Why was he on that wall and why did he fall?  Jasper Fforde's The Big Over Easy answers these questions.  As the story opens, Detective Jack Spratt of the Nursery Crime Division is suffering a bit of a losing streak:  his attempt to get the Three Little Pigs convicted on murder charges (they had deliberately set a trap for the Wolf) has ended in acquittal.  Now, he (and his new assistant, Mary Mary) are called on to investigate Dumpty's death.  It looks accidental until forensic evidence shows a gunshot wound.  In this world, success in detecting is a publish or perish thing, and no one publishes better than Friedland Chyme, Spratt's ex-partner who is now the number two detective in the land.  Chyme is able to solve mysteries with a fantastic deductive ability and his stories are often featured in popular crime periodicals.  Spratt, on the other hand, is wholly unfamous, but it is soon obvious that he is actually the better detective.  It's hard to describe the plot, which while coherent is often convoluted.  Fforde not only pokes a lot of fun at nursery rhymes but he tears apart the conventions of mystery stories as well.  Besides parodying various classic detectives such as Inspector Moose (Morse) and Miss Maple (Marple), we also see twists on mystery cliches such as "the butler did it".  While the Thursday Next series is amusing, it also is rather grim at times; not so with this novel, which has a nice light touch.  What the book winds up being is perhaps Fforde's best work to date and a delight to read. 
 The mark of a successful coming of age story is that you, the reader, can see yourself reflected in the protagonist.  For me, this book worked very well.  Will McLean, the main character and first-person narrator, a second generation Irish boy, son of a Marine, a mongrel outsider in the pedigreed Carolina Military Institute searches for himself, the man within the boy who is being molded by a system of discipline and honor that doesn't match his internal morality.  He's an English major in a college of warriors.  He's a basketball player, a finesse guard, in a school of brute force.  He's fighting against systems he doesn't understand within a life choiceless in it's inequality.    Pat Conroy, himself a graduate of the model for the fictional Institute, The Citadel, weaves a compelling tension-filled story while eloquent in his setting, Charleston, South Carolina.  Employing gracious proper Southern dialect filled with flowers, antiques, and tradition, he describes brutality, racism, sexism, and betrayal.  The language works well because it provides within its description the biting irony of the scenes.  Will McLean fights through every taboo the South has to offer in the 1960's:  a black cadet in the all-white tradition of the military college, an unwed pregnant girl shunned by society for her shame while the father of her baby remains blameless, the brutal plebe system that crushes individuality while remaking young men as soulless military automatons, the classed society of high south old money and it's cruelty to those not born within the circle, and the fact that military honor doesn't equate to individual morality.    Fighting through this maze of pitfalls, McLean has only his closest and dearest friends to rely on, roommates Dante "Pig" Pignetti and Mark Santoro, two brawny, Northern boys of Italian descent and Tradd St. Croix, an "old Charlestonian" (from a very rich and respected family).  His moral guide through the story is the epitomy of hard military men, Colonel "Bear" Berrineau, a vulgar battle-scarred man whose character is unimpeachable and whose idea of duty includes awful repercussions.    I loved this story and I couldn't put it down.  If I had one criticism to give, it's that Conroy tried to put too much into the novel - too many problems and taboos and tried to fix hundreds of years worth of problems in one book.  But, that's not really a criticism because he did it and did it well.  Bravo.  CV Ric 
 I saw this movie in Bangkok while I was working there and it quickly became one of the most influential films in my life.  It was a major event for the Thais, as it truely draws from the art, history, and incredible depth of folklore and tradition ingrained into the Thai culture through this beautiful film.  The story is sometimes confusing if you are a non-Thai, since it is based off a story that is so entrenched in the culture (similar to Romeo and Juliet in western culture), but if you can stretch your imagination then it becomes one of the most beautiful love stories, with some very unique twists (the main character is a ghost, among other unusual circumstances).  The cinematography is astounding and the portrayal of magical realism, ancient Thai culture, and beauty is equally noteworthy.  I highly recommend this film 
 I received my utility knife several weeks ago ande was so pleased with it that I ordered one more for myself and some for my family members.  I first noticed the weight and suspension of the knife and felt it to be excellent. I find that  when carving and chopping that is important. I also like the length  of  the 16 inch blade for all my uses 
 Johnny Depp stars as writer Mort Rainey living in seclusion in a lakefront residence in upstate New York after having been estranged from his wife Amy, played by Maria Bello.  Depp is licking his wounds from the discovery of his wife having an affair in a motel room with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton.  The Steven King created storyline gets weird almost immediately when Depp gets an unexpected visit from Southern drawling stranger John Shooter played by John Turturro.  Turturro alleges that Depp has plagiarized a story he had written and threatens him.  In short order everything surrounding Depp begins to become destroyed.  He asks for and gets help from detective type Ken Karsch played by Charles Dutton but the tragedies keep on occuring.  In typical King fashion, the storyline gets a jolting twist when we discover that both Depp and Turturro may not be exactly what we think they are.  "Secret Window" was an entertaining but not especially noteworthy investment of 96 minutes 
 To judge this book properly, it helps to consider the impact it has made on people's lives since it was first published five years ago.  DIAGNOSING JEFFERSON has offered thousands of readers and their families more than hope--that an idiosyncratic life can be rewarding and constructive.  It has brought much peace to families formerly distraught over harsh-sounding diagnoses and the prospect of entrapment in the labyrinth of autism.  The author has been careful not to say that Thomas Jefferson had Asperger's Syndrome.  Instead, this well-researched work has made the point that the aggregate of Jefferson's well-reported odd behavior is compatible with those traits we now classify scientifically as Asperger's--that there is a preponderance of evidence that the Third President was at least on the autism/Asperger's continuum, or spectrum.  Scholars who have spent the better part of their lives studying this complex Founder have scratched their heads for two centuries over Thomas Jefferson's unexplained quirks.  At the time it was demonstrated by DNA examination that his paternity of Sally Hemings's children was likely, if not a provable fact, there was a minor media frenzy.  And during that print and broadcast attention, NBC's TODAY show featured an interview with Dianne Swann-Wright of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.  Her frank admission on camera January 27, 2000, said it all:  "There was a personal side of Thomas Jefferson that many of us just simply haven't been able to understand."  A shortage of understanding is also at the crux of the uneasy relationship that exists between the world of "Aspies" and those of us who are "neurotypical."  In many ways this book has bridged that gap.  While strong on secondary sources to illustrate historical biographers' admissions of puzzlement about Jefferson's behavior, the book has also revealed what this condition of Asperger's Syndrome is all about, where it is likely to become a fork in a person's road through life.  Strong also on tracing features of Jefferson's long and productive life, this work has proved sympathetic, or at least understanding, of the Founder in his choices--one of the few treatments of Jefferson in print that has regarded him as a human being, not as an icon or eternally unknowable saint.  The most obvious failing of the critics of this book is their predisposition to judge without actually examining the work for what it illustrates, for the evidence it presents in full context, and for what it asks us to consider reasonably.  They make it plain they have never actually read DIAGNOSING JEFFERSON.  They condemn the notion that Jefferson's vast collection of idiosyncrasies can be matched against diagnostic criteria that have been developed over the past fifteen years and that the collections can be found compatible.  Is this work a diagnosis?  Possibly.  In the absence of any other explanation for the sweeping array of coincidences we are given to ponder, reason would incline the open-minded toward the affirmative.  The author's use of such secondary sources as Brodie, Malone, Peterson, Jordan, and other respected scholars--his presentation of their findings--has been unassailable.  To wander here and there and claim, "Oh, well, there is another explanation for that quirk of TJ's," ignores the presentation of the whole picture and the conclusion it has suggested.  Such diversion is nit-picking and the sign of a mind that is prematurely closed.  As further illustration of that, on several occasions the author has attempted direct contact with critics in order to debate areas of disagreement, only to be rebuffed impatiently or ignored.  In a time when scientists are attempting to cope with a possible epidemic of the spectrum condition of autism, when parents are looking for answers about a condition that continues to elude full understanding, open-mindedness seems a better approach to the suggestions of DIAGNOSING JEFFERSON and other studies than slamming the door on writers' and scholars' findings.  For those perpetually puzzled about Thomas Jefferson's oddities, this book may have connected the right dots.  What has made it so compelling is that no one else has ever tried to connect the dots at all.  As for the author's claim that there is no other known condition that matches so well the entire range of Jefferson's quirkiness, that continues to stand after five years of this thesis's circulation and consideration.  Think of the lesson, "If it walks like a duck, etc."  The publisher, Future Horizons, Inc., gambled and gave the book a good initial run as its first hardcover.  While it is not a bestseller, it went into a second printing in hardcover last year.  The appeal was that this work has given dimensions to Thomas Jefferson that few writers--perhaps Brodie, perhaps Jordan--have made any effort to present.  That appeal attracted first a mainstream publisher in metro New York that was in financial trouble and had to abandon the work, then Future Horizons, a specialty publisher in the field of autism.  Many teens and young adults with high-functioning autism and Asperger's Syndrome had considered themselves "losers," or aliens dropped on the wrong planet, until DIAGNOSING JEFFERSON came along.  The theme of this book was strengthened by subsequent examination (not so in-depth as that with Jefferson) of a dozen other achievers in ASPERGER'S AND SELF-ESTEEM.  How many creative people have turned toward a better path than one leading to dead-end despair because of these books?  We may never know, but we do know that the works have had positive effects on many, into the thousands.  Best-selling author Dr. Temple Grandin, whose comments are incorporated in this work, has said that "genius is an abnormality."  That observation certainly jibes with what we know of Thomas Jefferson.  His personal demeanor was odd, his mannerisms were odd, his choices and lifestyle were odd, and yet his reasoning and especially his writings were remarkable, brilliant, beyond anything known in his time or since.  The handy add-on in DIAGNOSING JEFFERSON--examples of the astounding range of interests represented by Jefferson's writings--attests to something in the Sage of Monticello that is far outside contemporary observations and experience with any men and women of today.  And because we know so little of quiet geniuses among us, as though they may have consigned themselves to anonymity lest their brilliance seem intimidating to the rest of us, this work has raised a few social considerations.  Have we been treating the "developmentally disabled" as a second class, as we have done with women and with people of color or exotic national origins or unfamiliar religions?  What do we gain by doing so, if not the feeding of our darker side, and more importantly, what do we lose?  Some of this is addressed in the final chapter, in which the illustration has been used of the teenaged Jefferson's search for a proper educational environment.  Similar searching has been recommended to meet the needs of today's creative young people who feel stuck in hostile social settings euphemistically referred to as "high schools."  The parallel is apt--and astonishing for its coincidence and relevance.  As one or two reviewers have correctly observed, a reader can learn as much about high-functioning autism from this book as he or she can learn about Thomas Jefferson.  It is to be hoped that connection can be kept alive, to give stature to the so-called social misfits of today who (as currently suppressed geniuses among us) may show us a better way to manage Earth than use every resource for destroying the place and wiping out as many of its inhabitants as the whims of our "leaders" dictate.  
 I love this book and now have to find the rest of his books.   This book alone explains tidbits of things like the origin of the comb, or the napkin, holidays... so much.   People @ my work couldn't wait to read it since I'd give out a history here and there 
 Hiaasen is one of my favorite authors and this book may be his best and funniest work. Hiaasen's books combine laugh out loud humor with intriguing stories and a dose of moral outrage. In Skin Tight he masterfully skewers plastic surgery, ambulance chasing lawyers, and TV hosts. You can't help but laugh at the Geraldo type character and don't get me started on the weed whacker parts.   In fact, this book is so wonderful that it made me realize that my dream of becoming an author was actually possible. Fantastic 
 When Adam Smith was writing about economics back in 1776 he was right in that the basics of the economy was 'labor, capital and land.' At that time there was little  else. But since that time the technological advances that have been made are so huge that the old ideas of 'labor, capital and land' are inadequate.   Consider, for instance, the value of Microsoft. What they really sell in the nature of a product is the arrangement of a bunch of bits of data. The operating system or the word processor has a reproduction cost of near zero compared to the selling price.    The ability of the economics profession to value such developments has been slow to come about. This book, written by an economics columnist for the Boston Globe is a popularized treatment of some of the thinking that is taking place.   A very interesting few pages here and there through out the book refer to the oil industry. It is interesting to consider what will happen to the whole economic world, both practical and theoretical as the price of oil increases over the coming years. Can this new concept of the value of knowledge predict what will happen 
 BUY THIS! We were given the card version of this game as a gift and were so addicted we purchased the board game version which is even more fun (but better for 3+ players). Anyone who visits at our house gets hooked as well. The card game is good for 2 players and makes a good gift at about $15-20, the board game is more like $30-40 but totally worth it. We have also invested in some of the expansion sets and a computer version. Don't let the rules bog you down in the begining, you will enjoy this game!  
 this is a great CD.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music 
  First off, IGNORE Renee's rating, this woman has ISSUES!!!!!!  This toothbrush works great! Would Highly recommend. 
 Preston and Childs have ended this trilogy with a great high adventure read. Agent Pendergast is a most intriguing central character as are the supporting cast members.  The ending leaves one to believe that there could be yet another novel.....????  Keep 'em coming!  
 Great CDs.  I much prefer the Fauntine and Eponine in this recording to the Origional London Cast.  See Amazon.com's listing for this item. Several Les Mis conousseurs have given detailed, very helpful reviews, however, amazon doesn't have any to sell, so buy it here at CDnow, but if you want a great review of what to expect, take a look at amazon 
 This is a great movie about how Bush and his brother worked their corruption-magic in stealing the 2000 election. I'd like to recommend a movie that is more important, though. It is 911 in Plane Site. Check out www.911inplanesite.com. The movie shows suppressed news footage and video evidence that proves the government's "official story" is ludicrous. EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS!!! Please, check it out. Show as many people as possible 
 I just finished reading this book. The writer has used a very gripping approach to explain the evolution of the idea of complex numbers. However, at some points, the book does get involved too much into mathematicas and loses its historical touch. I would say it is 70-% history and 30% Maths. Great work 
 Other reviewers have suggested that this is not one of Tuchman's best books.  This may not be a fair observation in comparison to "Guns of August" or "The Calamitous 14th Century".  Overall I found this book to be a concise and well-written work with the chapters well organized and consistent.  Some reviewers have pointed out that this book may have been intented to viel a criticism of the US war in Vietnam.  Whether that is the case or not, it seems evident that referring to the Vietnam war as folly is hardly controversial these days.  True, her points may be relevant to the current Iraq war, but I think that the larger point that she is trying to make is that folly applies to many political and military conflicts between nations.  If her comments apply to the Iraq war, could they not also apply to Serbia's Balkan wars, or Chechnya, or the UN's disjointed attempts at reining in North Korea or Iran?  Her points and concerns raised through these case examples are worth considering in modern times throughout dozens of current conflicts worldwide.  All in all, this is an excellent book.  fans of Tuchman or history in general will not be disappointed 
 WoooW!! What an elaborated and extensive material about the best band in the world! this book has every moment, every day, every story about the greatest John, Paul, George and Ringo told by themselves; this book is an invaluable work and every people who likes every kind of music has to buy it! I recommend it especially for the young people who begin to play music and former musical groups with their friends, I'm sure everyone will love this book. THE BEATLES SHOKING ALL THE WORLD AGAIN!! 
 Programming in prolog is an excellent book, good reference about the core of prolog and its Edinburgh implementation. This book contains all you have to know about the "core". Easy to understand and fast to  read 
 Thomas Disch's 334 has got to be the most depressing book I have ever read, an SF novel about people more than ideas or plot.  The book (more a series of inter-related stories than a novel) is set in a future New York City (mis)governed by technocratic socialistic regime which enforces eugenics, attempts to radically redefine gender roles,  and placates citizens with drugs and televised pornography.  The focus of the book is the lives of several ordinary tenants of an overcrowded and decrepit public housing project, people whose lives range from unfulfilling to abjectly miserable, flawed people whom the soulless welfare state is incompetent to help, or people unable to meet their potential in the inhuman society that that inefficient bureaucracy has, by accident or design, created.  Disch skillfully never strays into condescension or preachiness and always shows and never tells, depicting people and events that are never spectacular or maudlin, but are instead utterly quotidian and horribly believable.  334 is much better than Disch's earlier novel, Genocides, and more on a par with his impressive Camp Concentration, which shares with 334 forays into experimental (and generally successful) story structures and techniques.      
 I agree with others on this page, Ferris' anthology is wide-ranging and wonderful, this is a book every family should own and read 
 Rather like scientists who argue tentatively from "inference to the best explanation," John Pollock mitigates his speculations with what seems a broad scholarship and familiarity with relevant topography, historical accounts, archeology, biblically cross-referenced clues and implications, and hermeneutics. The result is an outstanding biography of the first century evangelist who influenced the course of human history more than any political figure has. At one point, discussing "a certain political event in Ephesus" during an account of what is known as Paul's second missionary journey, Pollock describes his method in these words: "Paul's story enters a brief though vital period when the facts are obscure. Luke turns very discreet." After citing a highly plausible political explanation for Luke's discretion, he continues: "What happened must be pieced together from clues scattered aground the New Testament and in secular history. . . A biographer has to decide between slowing to a halt here in a bog of conflicting possibilities which can never be resolved, or striding boldly across a causeway of conjecture. I choose the second course and, without stepping aside to discuss all the alternatives, tell the story as I see it. Paul's next eighteen months unfold somewhat as follows, though the tone of assurance in my narrative must not disguise that some of its conclusions are tentative and disputable." (p 192) This excerpt furnishes a good picture of Pollock's approach when some speculation is necessary to flesh-out the story.  The book is an extremely enjoyable reading experience. This from chapter 15: Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke, "probably in the last week of July 50 [AD]," under sail from Troas: "They did not think of themselves as passing from the  continent of Asia to Europe. The terms were in use, but the  Aegean was Greek on either side. They had, instead, the  excitement of approaching a new province, bringing them  nearer Rome. They knew that beyond Macedonia they could  reach Achaia and Italy, and the vast lands of Gaul, Spain,  Germania, even the mist-bound island of Britain lately added  to the empire: all save Rome untouched by the Good News.  They were not bringing force of arms or a political program:  just four men -- and Another, invisible, who had known these  seas and shores before Achilles or Agamemnon or Ulysses;  who could demolish empires and cities by the breath of His  mouth, but who had chosen to humble Himself and come to  Macedonia as quietly, as weakly as, in the flesh, He had come  to Bethlehem half a century before. " (p 124)  Sea routes, roads, typical seasonal meteorology, local flora, the lay of cities, ports and provinces, physical features of the landscapes, political liaisons and intrigues, local deities, the art, architecture and practices of pagan worship centers, the identity and motivations of opposition, philosophical schools, regional industries, first century seamanship and vessels -- Pollock descriptively reveals all of these elements of the New Testament narratives. While a typical reading of the New Testament virtually ignores these features of context, to better recognize them is certainly a boon to understanding. This is one of the great values of this book. Pollock also manages to reveal Paul's characteristics, tendencies, reasonings, knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy, personal interests and personality traits; he does this rather speculatively, but based on cited references nonetheless. An example: "they took the ship through the islands of the Cyclades, beautiful in a wine-colored sea. Paul could enjoy it. Because Acts has no place for his personal feelings he has been considered indifferent or loftily superior to scenery. Yet he writes of the beauty of the stars, how one differs from another in glory; he was aware of the beauty of the human body and he notes how in great houses he visited some of the vases and bowls were works of art, others merely useful."  The texts I've chosen to quote should give a sense of Pollock's biography of Paul, the fearless advocate, ambassador, mediator and counselor who modeled the understanding that "Christians must outlove, outjoy, outthink, and always welcome those who oppose them." I recommend the book, bearing in mind, of course, that direct textual statements have been augmented with inference and speculation. Two or three times I thought that Pollock's 'inferences' were likely not correct, but these are exceptions. Where speculation is unwise, unsupportable or unnecessary, Pollock generally steers clear. For example, regarding the possible Pauline authorship of the NT letter/book of Hebrews, Pollock says, "some hold that Hebrews was composed" during Paul's confinement in Caesarea in 58. He then briefly explains other views (p 265) without personally endorsing any of them. (The only biblical evidence of the authorship of Hebrews is 'textual' and, I believe, indicates that Apollos, the Alexandrian scholar, is the most probable author. Claims for Pauline authorship are inevitably attempts to explain why the letter doesn't sound/read as though Paul had written it, while the most likely explanation is simply that he did not. On the other hand, it does sound/read like the writings of well-known Alexandrian theologian/scholars [thus our obvious candidate is Apollos, as Luther believed]. Pollock reservedly states only that this particular question cannot be finally resolved.) I enjoyed the book on two levels, it ties together what often seem like disjoined narratives, and it is also a valuable series of contextual insights 
 I am in the process of reading Perry's Monk books in order.  All have been excellent, however, the climax of Sins of the Wolf was so surprising and exciting, it has won the title of best in series (so far).  The last 30 pages will leave you amazed 
 This is an amazing and fun read for all newlyweds out there!  Carley Roney and theknot.com team have really outdone themselves with their practical advice and research.  Topics include "married money", inlaws, buying your first home, division of household chores, decorating, keeping the flame alive, how to keep your friends, kid talk, holidays, and future planning.  I met the author herself during a book signing here in Chicago, and I now have an autographed copy! My husband Dan and I have great fun reading her book. A must have handbook for couples everywhere 
 Former Speaker Gingrinch provides a positive, albeit ambitious vision for our country using sound policies using common sense ideas.  Republicans, Democrats alike can appreciate Speaker Gingrich's belief in America and how we can maintain our competitive, moral, social and technological edge in the world.  A must read for anyone interested wanting to participate in the public debate.    
 Science fiction has always strived to reveal something about human nature, and this disturbing book achieves this goal like no other.  It casts a new light upon what it is people really want, and what happiness really means;  it makes one question some of one's deep values and beliefs. Quite some  time after this book a sequel was published, "The Humanoid  Touch".  It is just as disturbing, partially because having read the  first novel, I think the point of view of the author, or perhaps better,  the 'implied author' has changed.  This in no way decreases the value of  the books, which are a must for any sci-fi reader 
 There are a butt load of emcees and crews littering the world with their rhymes and swagger, but therer are only a few that really shine, and then again only a select few that provide and deliver true intelligent and witty and tight lyrics. Heiroglyphics is one of those few that provide expert lyricism and witty lyrics to the masses while stayin underground and true to themselves. The heiro crew is huge and I won't go into naming every member, but I do highly recommend this album to everyone. Especially heads into intelligent and tight lyrics. Qirky medaphors and smart wordplay asassinate over tight beats and production. A few of the choruses on the album are forgettable, but this is a must own. Much, much better than 3rd eye vision. Featuring some of the most abled emcees in the biz, Heiro is a crew that is in the top ten of hip hop. Every track is worth listening to and each member spits lyrics with precision and dead aim, lyrics that will have you reciting them over and over 
 Gorgeous pictures.  Wonderful history of the novel to movie story.  All GWTW fans should have this 
 I do remember as a kid ( 60's ) picking books from my parents library in the middle of a desert peninsula in Venezuelan Caribbean , inside a Shell Oil Refinery and reading Alexander Kazantsev: The Destruction of Faena, Jules Verne and most of his known and unknown classics , the Bible and it's amazing human tales ; then moving to the Usa and discovering Assimov's Foundation , Frank Herbert's Dune , Kurt Vonnegut Jr's The Sirens of Titan ( after watching 20 or less times Slaughterhouse 5 ) and Galapagos , Aldous Huxley's Island and Door's of Perception , Gurdjiell's All and Everything ; then coming to the Mexican Caribbean and discovering Ann Rice and the Vampires , Daniel Quinn and his adventures of mind and spirit and James Tiptree Jr ( she spent the 70's in the now Rivera Maya ) . To bad i did not get to read her as a man , it does change some prespective , but the stories in these collection are Up there with the Classics ... Highly entertaining with provoking ideas that we have not been able to surpass as the slow learners we are as humans .. 
 If I review the novel written by Kafka, it is 5 stars. But if I review this book published by this publisher, it is 2 or 3 stars.   The actual "Metamorphosis" created by Kafka consists of , in this book, only 58 pages. In order for the publisher to make a "book" out of this short story, they added things I never wanted to read. The lengthy introduction, all the academic brah brah brah things about Kafka and his works. Only less than a quarter of the entire book is the story itself. The rest is useless for most readers.   I really don't care how other people analyse Kafka. What matters to me is the story itself and how it is written. Needless to say, I refuse to read what is taking more than three quarters of the book.  
 I have not complete the book entirely yet but it is a compelling story that is easy to read.  I have enjoyed all the Anna Quindlen book that I have read 
 It is an excellent book! The biggest reason why I like it is that it is a neutral book ~ the child has two of everything ~ it doesn't convey the child lives with one parent and visits the other parent. I really like this book 
 This book is divided into two sections - "Conjectures" and "Refutations".  Roughly, or not so roughly, these titles refer to the basic aim of the essays divided under them.  Moreover, the process of conjecture and refutation is itself the primary theory threading these various essays together. The first division consists of Popper's own conjectures about the nature of scientific method, human knowledge, the nature of metaphysics, a theory of tradition, etc.  The latter section: refutations of commonly held theories on the mind-body problem, the demarcation between science and metaphysics, language, and social philosophy.  In this Routledge Classics edition there is a third section of addenda pertaining to just a few of the individual essays in the text. For those who are unfamiliar Popper Conjectures and Refutations is probably one of the best ways to get to know him. Being a collection of essays originally published elsewhere, they are on varied themes.  These themes are often inspired by a conference or publication, but despite the occasional aspect of these writings they all generally further the the falsifiability thesis of scientific theories.  For Popper, this means that all theories, though they can not be "proved" by "experience" or "observation", that is empirically, they can be falsified by empirical means.  This is the truly empirical nature of scientific thought and the scientific method.  This empirical-ness of theories (or statements) is what makes them scientific. Unlike the early positivists argued, the empirical nature of the scientific method is not its ability to establish universal laws by the appeal to experience and the use of inductive reasoning.  The appeal to observation and experience work to corroborate theoretical claims, but can never "prove" a theory once and for all.  Along the same lines, Popper's demarcation between science and metaphysics figures heavily in these essays. While science consists of testable theories/statements to be corroborated or falsified by experience, metaphysics is constituted by un-testable, non-falsifiable theories/statements.  The un-testable, un-observable nature of metaphysical statements does not make them meaningless as Wittgenstein, Ayer, and others have argued - a universal claim about the nature of gravity is no way more meaningful - it simply makes them untestable, unfalsifiable, and unscientific. The philosophy of science and scientific method are not all that is important to Popper. They do not even exhaust the topics discussed in this book. I could write (and have written elsewhere) pages and pages on Popper's polical philosophy, his critiques of historicism and scienticism, and his epistemology. If you want a proper introduction buy Conjectures and Refutations.  You might want to consider his Poverty of Historicism as well 
 I got the book in very good condition. It was delivered in a timely manner. Thanks very much 
 If they are bringing THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY to DVD finally, then maybe it's time to unravel the complications surrounding this film and feature it on DVD.  SO PROUDLY WE HAIL is one of the greatest of all war movies, and because it is told from a woman's point of view (so to speak, it still had a male director in the person of Mark Sandrich) it is sometimes ridiculed and derided, usually by armchair critics who should walk a mile in a nurse's shoes before daring to denigrate her bravery under fire.  Claudette Colbert plays Janet Davidson.  An unusual choice for a nurse, Colbert eschews most of her usual glamor (except for the San Francisco embarkation) and really gives herself to the part.  Colbert is often good when she has to play against strong women, and here Sandrich surrounds her with a gallery of independent types, the way Francois Ozon made Catherine Deneueve shine in the recent 8 1/2 WOMEN.  Janet is a born leader even though she can only be photographed on one side of her face, which somewhat limits her utilitarian duty during battle scenes.  Even covered with grime and jungle grease, Colbert still can turn heads, and when she meets George Reeves, the sparks ignite, hot enough to burn Corregidor down to the ground.  Veronica Lake plays up her dark side playing Lieutenant D'Arcy, a time bomb just waiting to explode.  Often seen as soignee and bewitching, with that cute fringe of hair playing peekaboo with her eyes, Lake here is going for a Cornell Woolrich-style vengeance against the Japanese.  If Tarantino had made KILL BILL in the 1940s Lake would have beat Uma Thurman in the role easily.  She's hotter than a pistol and she's Ms. 45.  Paulette Goddard has, I think, the most challenging role and I agree with other reviewers who say this is Goddard's best part.  While Colbert and Lake really just occupy the same acting space throughout the movie, Goddard's character has to change, so that viewers watch her mature from a fly by night flapper with only men on her mind, to a woman with a heart who lives to help others, not just impress them with her oomph.  It's harder than it looks to walk that line, but Goddard pulls it off without a whimper.  Often cast as the sexpot pure and simple, or the gold-digging mantrap she apparently was in real life, Goddard is entirely persuasive in her role, and like Lake, she's a natural at action scenes.  I want her to be my nurse.  Her romance with "Kansas" is kind of cute too.  All in all, an underrated movie with the kind of plot that screws in deeper and deeper, unbearably tight, like DAS BOOT, except set in the Pacific 
 This is a great movie, especially if you like "Dancehall Queen". Paul Campbell does a great job as Capone and Carl Bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss. While the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching 
 We purchased the book from Herb at the Annapolis Boat Show, she read it to me as we drove home and we laughed at almost every paragraph she read.  It sealed our desire to join the crusing world, we soon began our search for a suitable crusing boat and began making plans to sell the house, quite the jobs, and take off for the South Pacific.  If Herb could make it to "paradise" then we can too.  His writing style will keep you laughing.. 
 LaSalle and Britton have put together some useful ideas for marketers and customer service specialists on how to turn something relatively ordinary, such as a stuffed animal or a hotel stay, into something ultra-special and memorable that buyers will want to repeat and recommend to others. What got in the way of an otherwise fine book for me is that in quite a number of places, they rave about companies as only public relations or sales people normally do - telling you only one side of the story.  For example, on pages 31-33 they say that people who shop at this very online bookstore feel that their voice is heard, because of the computer programming that delivers a "customized" experience.  What they are overlooking is that if you truly have an individual problem, it's extremely difficult to get it taken care of here.  There are many other examples that have the idealized tone of PR rather than real-world observation.  If this doesn't bother you, you'll have a more positive reading experience than I did 
 As the first book of this kind, this book has done an excellent job in provoking thinking and providing valuable career advice for business professionals with Asian ethnic background.   I highly recommend it to any Asian who works in North America or whose bosses happen to be white.   In contrast to other general career books, the book has done a great job to emphasize how important the soft skills like presentation and interpersonal skills are. Traditionally, Asians especially Chinese focus more on the hard skills like math, PC skills, probably under the influence of Confusian. (Confusian said: "A person of virtue should be quick in action but reluctant in words) Jane also covers the major weaknesses Asian people exhibit in North American business. I think her summary is insightful, comprehensive and worth to be kept for frequent reference. Jane also presents valuable anecdotal feedbacks on how westerners characterise Asian.   However, the book is far from being perfect. Several arguments are obviously out-of-date or only true in very few small and remote cities. For example, white people tend to think Asian-like people were not born in America. And Jane didn't do a good job in distinguishing the personality differences and the cultural differences. For example, the author cited that one Chinese girl just came to U.S but appreared to be more American than an Asian man born in America. I don't think it correct that if a person stands for herself, the action should be categorized as "American". it might be more due to the personality.   If Jane had more experience working in Hongkong, New Dehli, Singapore, and etc., she would have noticed that many many Asians have what she calls "American" attributes like aggressiveness, out-spoken, not afraid to confrontation.   Jane also tried to write a career encyclepedia, which was a bit over-ambitious goal. Readers will be better off to turn to other books for help on tactics like interview skills. The evaluation provided in the book is far from being sophisticate and also out-of-date. I will suggest you rely other general personality evaluation to get better understanding of yourself.      Obviously, Jane doesn't have much exposure to the rich traditional Asian literature(like one of the most famous, The Art of War). Some weaknesses she cites in the book can easily, in my humble opinion, overcome by drawing from the traditional values. This limited exposure also prevents her from providing much better career strategies.   Nevertheless, the book has inspired deep reflection and thinking, some of which is already reflected in this review.    As a Chinese immigrant studying and working in Canada, I found this book very helpful for my career. Besides providing ample foods for thinking, this book helps me better align my study and self-development plan. My friends also like it and we even had several good discussions.   Highly recommended!     
 We all love this book, adults, little kids, teenagers alike.  It has been a favorite of our family's for years 
 I finished the book over a month ago-I usually don't review at all- & especially with the top review from Ramon A. Nadal who participated in the battle-[much respect] However I thought it was a pretty even-handed account of the battle-policies of the time & emotional content wasn't overdone. I prefer documentery style books/movies etc...  It wasn't masked by any 60's rhetoric of the times- which is nice-altho it was very "in the moment".  I wanted to get a feel for real combat-as opposed to soldiers as numbers- as Im actively opposing aggressive wars in Afghanistan & Iraq.  John Findla 
 Java development on Linux has lagged behind until now. The news of the day  is Java Rocks on Linux. This book goes into detail how to get set up, what  tools are available and where to get them. There is a CDROM that comes with  the book and a website (CDROMS tend to get stale fast) for crucial updates,  news and other vital information. IMHO programming Java on Linux has been  one of the best kept secrets of the late 90s. This book is a step toward  disclosure. Linux and Java go together like milk and cookies 
 I give this book 5 stars out of respect for its enormous contribution to mathematical logic; for no doubt many of the authors of the more modern math-logic texts were greatly influenced by this book. But with that said, all of the material here is a proper subset of other current books which present the material much more clearly and using better notation. Examples include Burris' "Logic for Mathematics and Computer Science", Ebbinhaus' "Intro. To Math Logic", and Gallier's "Logic for Computer Scientists" 
 "A charming mystery, full of twists, with entertaining characters. The residents of sleepy little Emerald Point on the shores of Lake George have some surprising secrets. And so does the lake itself." Matt Witten, Supervising Producer, FOX TV Show -HOUSE, author of The Killing Be 
 Great book.  Love all of Chuck's insights and way of looking at the world and his relationships.  One complaint: overuse of the words "aforementioned" and "myriad".  Those words should be used rarely, as they are usually penned by people trying to sound smart.  Chuck - we know you're intelligent, you don't need those words 
 A master in the day, Bob Dylan's story of his early coffee shop day up untill about the mid-80's. Robert Shelton in 1961 wrote a article for Dylan that help his music take off.Dylan went from the Village folk scene to  performing in front of large crowds of people. This book shows the  transition from a coffee shop to the big stage. While telling you a blow  for blow story of Dylan's life right up untill the mid-80's. The  story  starts out close to Dylan and over the span of the novel it come more of a  distant observer. This book summerizes the whole time period and makes  Dylan's personality better known. His songs have more impact now that you  understand his motives. I recomend reading it 
 I really enjoyed this book.  It is easy to read and provides a wealth of information about various ways to treat and cope with fibromyalgia.  It is particularly nice to hear the stories and experiences of others who have  this illness.  This book is unlike any other out there and I want to thank  the authors for writing it 
 This was one of the first books that fostered diversity for young children. This is just a delightful story about a boy outdoors enjoying a snowy day. Kids relate to the gentle, simple story, and the illustrations are artistically wonderful 
 The books in the Penguin Pete series are great!  My son (who will be 3) has enjoyed these book for over a year.  However, they are meant for children older than this.  My son is fascinated with animal books and  stories and we read bigger kid books to him.  He still enjoys them 
 Great guide love the game plans on how to see the most for your time 
 After reading this book for the first time in the early 1980s, it changed the way I thought about both choosing what to feast upon and how to prepare it. I always wondered why I hated vegetables as a child. Having read the book, I realized that my mother--loving though she may have been--had cooked vegetables to death by boiling everything until it was soft, tasteless and unappetizing. When I began learning to cook for myself, the beauty of this text came through for me. Now I appreciate vegetables because I prepare them simply and let the flavor come through. I recommend this book to anyone who is a "picky" eater (and even to those who are not). Once you know why you don't like a variety of foods, you may discover that it's not the food you learned detest, but the way Mama cooked it for you 
 I love this book.  I often look through it for inspiration.  The photos are well done.  However, I do not agree with a previous reviewer in that something is missing (i.e the yogis/yoginnis are not sweating).  I think that was the idea.  The idea is to get to a level where yoga is like breathing.  Do you need to sweat to breath?  For most people the answer is no.  I thought of this book as a demonstration of various poses performed at the highest level possible.  It depicted yoga as an art form.  I enjoyed this book immensely 
 Lois Lowry has a unique gift for storytelling and this gift serves her well in her latest story Gossamer.  This is the story of Littlest One, a dream-giver, and a boy who needs her healing touch.  After reading this book I feel as if I have been a part of this story.  That I was actually there huddled under the bed when the terrible Sinisteeds came.  And I was with Thin Elderly when he wept in the attic. The characters in this book become real as I become engrossed in the story which balances between reality and the imaginary.  
 I bought this movie just because Gerard Butler is in the cast but I must say that the whole story is great! It's a different type of movie and it's based in an old bookclassic, which makes it even better. The cast is great, besides the hunky Gerard Butler. Worth seeing 
 This is by far the very best book I have read on golf and how to improve your came. Marshall Smith is simply wonderful and his book is easy to understand. Its easy to tell this man has been around golf for a long time. 
 This machine is a great buy for the price.  It was simple to put together, doesn't take up much room and is easy to use.  There is just a little noise when you are walking, but nothing the TV can't drown out. 
 Bat Ye'Or has performed an invaluable service, by carefully documenting the history of the Euro-Arab Dialogue, the EU's agreement to accept Islamic colonization in return for security, oil, and the hope for power to rival America. The US stands, perhaps with only Israel at our side, as "The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave. 
 This book is excelent! Filled with fiends, undead, oozes, and some fey, this book has so many ideas for that monster for the climactic battle, or if you just want to keep your players on their toes. There's also new rules for grafts, if you want a demonic leg or something, and fiendish prestiege classes! The only [minor] downsides are that most creatures have an incredibly high challenge rating, and for some reason there's a celestial in here... oh well. Anyway, I seriously recommend this book for any DM with even the slightest intrest in using Fiends in their campaign 
 Voices From The Fields is about nine different children all of which are Mexican/Spanish.  Each tells a different story about their life.  All of these children have one thing in common, they work in the fields or they have a close relative that works in a field.  Their stories range from being involved with gangs to the difficulty of moving up in society.  As different as these nine children may be, they all care very much for their families and believe nothing is more important. Throughout the book there are photographs of the children and their families.  Photographs aid the text in describing conditions and emotions of the people being discussed.  Through this mix of text and photographs emotions can be amplified.  Children most importantly can aid from photographs being provided since they may not understand certain things they read; yet photographs may open the doors for them.  The can better see different feelings such as joy or anger as well as people of different cultures in their own environment.  It can also become apparent to children who read the book just how important family is to each of the nine children.  They are all care for each other very deeply and this is obvious through the photographs.  Julia Hirsch says "A far more complex and elusive relationship between text and image occurs in those books which use snapshots, or other similarly dramatic image:  pictures which contain some emotional charge, such as a gesture caught in midstride, an object viewed from an unusual angle, an enigmatic facial expression, a blurred background, or deep shadows and diffuse lighting."(Hirsch, 142)  Manuel Araiza talks about his home in the book and such details such as the home being comprised of one room with a kitchen.  Next to the text where he is discussing these conditions is a picture of the house.  Immediately we feel more sympathetic towards Manuel since we are able to see with our own eyes what he is describing to us. The photographs in this book allow children readers to "experience" a minority culture that most children otherwise would never be exposed to.  Hirsch later goes on to say, "Photography in recent years has also given "visibility" to yet other aspects of the human condition which have formerly been kept from most children."(Hirsch 150)  One example of these "human conditions" is presented in the book for children to learn about.  This condition is the life of migrant farm workers and their families.  The photographs in this book depicting ethnic minorities, which also happen to be largely immigrants, provide for an excellent learning experience for children.   Books focusing on different cultures and ways of life especially ones with such rich and detailed photography are good for children.  These books help to educate on material that is beyond the classroom.  Emotions, feelings, and different situations are better understood.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, so by supplementing photographs with the text of the book children take with them a great deal more than would have been without photographs 
 I thought this one in the Kinsey series was quite different than Sue's others.  The beginning and the end of the novel were very exciting, but in the middle it was a little slow.  She seemed to be thinking and writing on a higher order for this one.  Make sure to pay very close attention to Agnes's clues near the beginning of the novel.  However, There were a couple of things that bothered me with the story.  Kinsey seemed to piece everything together quite easily together with Agnes's past.  It wasn't that clear for me on who was whom.  The character of Irene was obnoxious in the way she was always sickly.  Also, there didn't seem to be any apparent attraction between kinsey and the bodyguard, and then boom, they are romantically connected. All and all, I like this one and E is for Evidence the most so far in the series.    
 Thoroughly enjoyed the CD.  Have some of the songs as performed by other artists, but it's nice to hear them as performed by the writer.  I'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity. 
 Donley Watt's newest book is an entertaining read that uses a historical figure to portray three different characters at crucial moments in their individual lives.  It kept my attention through each chapter, and Watt does a great job of taking the reader to a politically-charged East Texas in the 50s through his excellent descriptive and narrative skills.  Fans of Watt and Texas fiction will surely want to pick this one up 
 The book lifts into the hard core facts about alcolhol, caffine, drugs, and other stimulants while keeping a common sense attitude to the subject.  Very interesting, especially for the college student 
 Cherry Hill always has great books that are both interesting and informational.  I have several in my home library and this may be the most useful one that I own.  The horse is so much more complicated than people realize and if you are able to understand what your horse is thinking then you will be able to be more successful in anything and everything you do with your horses.  The book has been an excellent source of information for training my own colts and understanding what they are thinking when you are trying to get them to respond to what you are asking them to do.  Cherry Hill is a great trainer and writer.  She has a great way of explaining training procedures and offers excellent information on how to make training easier on both the trainer and the horse.  Your horse will thank you for reading this book!

 Although it could have had a better ending, this was a very good Australian thriller. (Sam Neill) and his wife played by (Nicole Kidman) are a married couple who take their yacht on the high seas. They are several days out when they spot a ship in distress. Before they can reach it however, they are met by a man (Billy Zane) who rows an oarboat to their yacht and informs them that the ship is about to sink. He relates a tale about how the crew and passengers onboard went crazy, and then died a hallucinatory death after eating some canned foods. Sam Neill suspects food poisoning.  However, when Billy Zane goes to sleep Sam Neill rows his boat to see if there is anything he can do help save the yacht from sinking. To his horror, he finds that the crew and passengers have been murdered. Racing back to get to his yacht, Billy Zane awakens in time to take control of the ship and strands Sam Neill in the middle of the sea. Using his smarts, Neill manages to get the other yacht working for a short time while he pursues Billy Zane in order to rescue his wife. Not a bad film, but as I wrote in the beginning, the ending should have been better. However, all in all it is a very good film. Recommended 
 The Leadership Challenge is a guide for leaders of all types of organizations, including mine which is a law enforcement agency.  The title clearly is an outline of the book as Kouzes and Posner explain in detail that while leadership is challenging, it is also rewarding, and they clearly and concisely provide the reader with the skills necessary to meet "The Leadership Challenge."  Kouzes and Posner provide an outline for effective leadership with their Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership.  The practices suggested are: (1)Model the Way by setting examples and planning small wins (2) Inspire a Shared Vision by envisioning the future and enlisting others to see your vision. (3)Challenge the Process by searching for opportunities, experimenting and taking risks (4), Enable Others to Act by fostering collaboration and strengthening others (5) Encourage the Heart by recognizing individual contributions and celebrating accomplishments.  The substance of the book could be summarized into these Five Practices.  In fact, the entire book could be condensed into a pocket version for managers/leaders to refer to.  More than being a self help book, The Leadership Challenge is a reference book and motivational book.  The book inspired me to want to be a leader and adopt those traits that effective leaders possess.  The authors list the most desired qualities of a leader from data collected from over two decades of research and found the top four to be honesty, forward looking, competent, and inspiring.  The research showed that for people to follow willingly, the leader must possess these traits.  Kouzes and Posner address each of their characteristics in the book and provide the reader with instruction of how to be this type of person.  They also offer examples of various individuals in leadership positions who faced adversity and were able to successfully overcome it.  In fact, the authors note that leaders see adversity as an opportunity to teach and learn.  Finally, I found that The Leadership Challenge not only showed you how to lead others, but also how to lead yourself. 
 Waitress in the Donut Shop proves once again that Maria Muldaur is the sexiest songstress ever! Man!  Can she ever get down and raunch!  Tunes of special note on this album include:  It's Ain't the Meat It's the Motion, and the not to be missed Brickyard Blues 
 I've perused an number of books trying to figure out just what Tantra is about.  They are mostly obscure, or lacking answers to the questions which inevitably come to mind.  This author, however, leaves no stone unturned, providing not only interesting background, culture, and history, but the very practical "how to" go about it.  His directions are clear, easy to follow, and effective.  My favorite part of the book, however, was the two pages at the end of the book where he talked about the relationship between Guru and Chela, based on Tantra.  This is a relationship vision for which I had long been searching.  Another book which I found exceedingly valuable is "Passionate Enlightenment" 
              This movie is so COOL! About this Border Terrier named Hubble and 4 earth dogs named Shep a Bernese Mountain dog, Nelly, Willson a Boxer, and a poodle. And the dogs talk! And theres also a black or gray (Can't tell which) Great Dane.                                 It's SOOOO Cute and funny!                           DO buy it 
 I had first gotten this book when I went to my sons book fair at school. My 1 yr old daughter immediately fell in love with it and I have been reading it to her ever since. She loves the beautiful graphics in the story, and the wonderful rhyming keeps her tuned into the story. We have even made up little motions to go along with the story so she can participate actively in the story. I recommend this book to any parent, I believe this book has helped my daughter to start sounding out words already, and I feel confident that she will be an avid reader because of books like this. David Kirk does a wonderful job as a story teller, and I cannot wait to read all his childrens books to my own 3 children 
 This is a classic tale of a company run into the ground because it had two CEOs and two different departments fighting one another for the juicy bonuses. Moreover, the CEOs had totally different characters and a completely different business vision. One was extrovert, overambitious, jealous, profoundly selfish, impulsive, volatile, dominated by lust for power, vindictive, an intriguer. The other was rather introvert, cold, too trusting, apersonal, a bad communicator, self-centered, rather an intellectual aristocrat.  The introvert was ousted by the extrovert, who wanted to run his own show.  The house of Lehman was divided in two different clans: the bankers who were rather fixed on medium and long term business with stable clients and the traders who were only fixed on the short term. While the introvert CEO could stand above both business divisions in the battle for the bonuses, the extrovert was himself a trader and was rather despised by the bankers. When the latter took the rein, key banking personal left the company. The traders wanted to cash in their shares as quickly as possible and the company was gobbled up by a third party.  This story shows also that `human relations matter as much as the bottom-line.'  A very worth-while read. 
 Daniel Callahan, ethicist and co-founder of the Hastings Center, has written a provocative book which discusses and evaluates the problem of resource allocation in Western society. Essentially, we spend a significant percentage of health care costs on the last few years of life, regardless of the quality of life being prolonged. Dr Callahan warns that we will not be able to support these policies indefinitely, particularly as Western populations continue to age. The more tests and procedures we develop, and the greater our skill at extending life, the more expensive terminal health care becomes. This is not a popular perspective. Many people believe that anything short of providing full available health care to all is morally reprehensible. However, it is undeniable that we are already unable to provide all people with even basic medical care with the current resources available. Indeed, we have only to look at the US to see a future of medicine - sky-rocketing costs, and massively disproportionate services depending on location and financial capacity. As a nurse I have seen first-hand how focusing on prolonging life can be a worse, and certainly more expensive, outcome for the elderly. As an ethicist I find Callahan's arguments sound and convincing 
    This cd is great! My girls love it!! Laurie Berkner is there favorite! But they also like Hot Peas n Butter and the other favorite The Dirty Sock Funtime Band! 
 Un disco sumamente romantico para la gente romantica.  Yo creci con esta musica y siempre me trae buenos recuerdos.  Aparte de que me encanta la voz de Camilo Sesto y el sentimiento que le pone a sus canciones, ojala y hubiera seguido cantando.  Este disco recopila sus grandes exitos y creo que no pude encontrar uno mas completo que este 
 I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for movies that end with the down-and-out coming out on top.  Pretty amazing chemistry between the characters Jack (Bruce Willis), and Eddie (Mos Def). Def's whiny sing-song voice was a combination of funny and annoying.  Loved the way it ended, but I heard there were some alternate endings in the special features, which I didn't get to see.  Willis' makeup was great, he looked like hell while he was on the run, and 10 years younger when he blows out the candles on his cake at the end.  *spoilers*  Loved the fact that Eddie named his bakery Eddie & Jack's, and the pictures he sent were great, too.  And of course there's Willis' signature line "You're killin' me. 
 This fine book is an effort to produce a scholarly work that is accessible to the broad reading public.  Prof. Low is quite successful in her effort to satisfy both audiences.  Her primary preoccupations are to examine the consequences of fundamental differences between men and women in reproductive strategies, and through the examination of these consequences to demonstrate the utility of applying relatively simple Darwinian concepts to the study of human social behavior.  She draws on a wide variety of literature, including ethnology, history, studies of other mammalian species, particularly other primates, and political science research.  The first 2 or 3 chapters are relatively rudimentary but give a very careful overview of the intellectual apparatus used, and the limitations of that apparatus, for studies of this kind.  The chapters on human behaviors specifically are excellent; thorough, well documented, and intellectually honest.  This is a convincing book which may upset some but contains very well thought out and very well defended analyses of many aspects of human behavior.  There is an excellent bibliography and fine footnotes 
 Divided We Fall is a well-made film, artistically and historically. The lighting, cinematography and recreation of history is brilliant, as is the direction. Plot-wise, it is a gripping film because it touches upon the psychological impact of ordinary people caught up in violent, murderous, tumultuous times. The repercussions of the Holocaust upon the millions of lives of those who have been effected is inestimable. Europe is still reeling from the damage not only in terms of loss of life and physical suffering, but also emotional scars that are personal, social, national and international. This movie is but a microcosm that explores a struggle with conscience, confused loyalties and unwilling participants caught up in sheer madness. The acting is excellent. The directing is tight without dragging or creating melodrama, and the story line is compelling 
 "Weedflower" is the moving story of Japanese-Americans during WWII - - especially appropriate when the fragility of human rights is being demonstrated during yet another war. Sixth-grader Sumiko and her young brother Tak Tak were taken in by close relatives following the death of parents. Sumiko finds healing through hard work & dreams of someday owning a flower shop. Their life is one of few surprises, with strict adherence to the family regimen but Sumiko is crushed by rejection from the mother of a white schoolgirl who had invited her to a birthday party.  Then follows the unthinkable blow of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the evacuation of "Nikkei" (Nisei) to detention centers. An important part of the book for me is what was NOT discussed; the curtain of dust in the desert is described in vivid detail so that readers will almost taste that suffocating bitterness. But Cynthia Kadohata does not mention the comfortable "others" shielded by a curtain of censorship employed by our government. It lowered  this  curtain separating those secure in their rights from those who couldn't know whether their rights would ever again be respected.   Curtained by dust and detention the Nisei agonized to make their lives orderly once more. Kadohata writes about the details of everyday life: in southern California where the flower farm was diligently tended & family standards adhered to  /AND/  in the Camp built for detainees on a Mohave Indian reservation where the rigid family structure fell apart as goals were abandoned and purpose for living so deeply shaken.  Recollecting the days after Pearl Harbor I am surprised by the perception that the Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) were the only group expressing shock and concern. There is an unsettling similarity in the treatment of the Japanese-Americans and conscientious objectors during WWII, although even less has been written about the latter. I have experienced a few years of primitive living conditions but never racial discrimination and total disruption.  Sumiko feels that those (Issei) not  born in America & imprisoned in North Dakota "would die of cold and she would die of heat" in Arizona. "And then, she believed, the rest of America would be satisfied."  But Sumiko was better prepared for the ordeal than some because "her whole life.....had been a lesson in how to change your lot by accepting it and learning from it."  The Native Americans did not welcome the Camp on their reservation but they eventually benefited from the fact that the Nisei were better treated by the government! There were many tensions among detainees that would not have occurred to me; these are described with great sensitivity by the author. The government's pressure on the Nisei to "support the war effort" by taking jobs 'outside'  and  the pressure exerted on men to join the military seem the ultimate ironies.  Whatever our ages, we will learn much from this book about the elements of Camp life, the desperation of people hanging on to their sanity, the gifts of friendship, the price of freedom - - these must all be thoughtfully pondered and shared. Reviewer mcHAIKU  also recommends that you find Allen Say's provocative writings: "Music for Alice" (# 0618311181) & "Home of the Brave" (# 061821223X) to read with family or friends.   In the bittersweet yet hopeful ending, the author of "Weedflower" has Sumiko leaving her Mohave friend, Frank, for a new life: Sumiko writes that leaving is "like you didn't know if people would let you in their grocery store" . . . and readers may  continue to wonder if Sumiko's "freedom" will allow her to resume a quasi-normal existence?  This beautifully told story should provoke much discussion and self-examination about how we view the rights of our neighbors. Will we allow these questions to transform our thinking . . . like the life cycle of the moth so important to Sumiko who transformed the desert with her treasured "kusabana" - - or weedflowers?     
 Excellent - all tunes,no need to skip over one!  Dynamic vocals, music and harmony. Just love them, expecially Clouds - superb, and also Eyes Can't See. Such thought provoking, great to listen and move to tunes! 
 I just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday, I was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - I was surprised because I hadn't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air, when I realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry.  Like Seventh Generation's lavender laundry detergent, I love this product - if you use them in tandem, not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender (not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products), but they come out clean and soft.  I especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it's gentle enough to use on my baby's clothes, too!  I love that it's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil.  It's also safe for my septic system, so I'm sold on this product.  If you're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or can't find one that smells good to you, try this one!  
 Set somewhere in heartland (actually, "Midland") America around the turn of the 20th century, "The Magnificent Ambersons" is a sharp and ultimately melancholy look at change.  Founded on old money, the family's generations glide easily along in extravagance, until the cash runs out.  Their unwillingness to adapt to new times and new industry dooms their lives of comfort and inertia, as their mansions decay and their neighborhood becomes one of common housing and polluted air.    The protagonist is George Amberson Minafer, the sole inhabitant of the third generation and an insufferable snob.  He gets his come-uppance in the end, but the Ambersons have fallen so far so quickly that hardly anyone notices or cares anymore.  He's chagrined to find after the fall of  the house of Amberson that his once-prominent family is not even mentioned  in the city history of great family names.  His mother is irrationally, almost beyond belief, defensive and protective of her little scion.  It's no wonder he was the terror of the town for so many years.    Booth Tarkington gradually clues the reader in that something's going wrong with the Amberson empire.  He points out, mostly through Minafer's  agonized thoughts, that nothing is permanent.  The great fortunes and mansions that displace the Ambersons will themselves fade one day, and the customs and people one knows from infancy on will likewise shift.  Midland undergoes a jarring shift from the wealthy and their poorer but settled neighbors to a bustling, dirty city of what Minafer sees as money-grubbing ethnic immigrants and incessant change.  The old rich who didn't adapt  fall victim to what one modern political commentator has called "creative destruction."  As if to underscore the transitory nature of things, Tarkington kills off most of the Amberson family as if it were itself somehow defective and weak.  Minafer redeems himself somewhat at the end but only because of necessity.  The few Ambersons who are left find themselves in a nearly alien culture that took only several decades to establish itself.  Like Ozymandias, the Ambersons thought themselves and their way of life to be endless. Tarkington's rather bleak message seems to be that nothing is forever, no future is guaranteed, and that those who follow have no more claim on permanence than the mighty who have fallen before them.      
 Although this book is around fifty years old, it is especially compelling today.  Who are the Iraqis? This is a classic description of Iraqi village society, as I suspect it remains today.  Fernea spent 2 years in an Iraqi village while her husband was gathering material for his doctoral dissertation there.  Elizabeth, or Beeja (BJ) as the Iraqi women call her, is part of the society of women in the village, and her immensely readable account explains much about the gulf that separates Americans from the Muslim world.  The  account of her pilgrimage with the other village women gives an amazing, hypnotic view into the nature of Islam and its adherents. A well-written, thoughtful, absolutely stunning book 
 I love to send books by PD Eastman to my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter because I can always count on the same response: She LOVES his books! Carries the new one around and tries to entice any handy adult to read it to her. Why are they such a treasure? I haven't a clue; they just possess some sort of magic that a 3 1/2 year old thinks is the right stuff. That's good enough for me. I am going to be very sad when we run out of Mr. Eastman's books 
 All of the Marjane Satrapi books, illustrated in drawings, are an excellent view of Iran as it changed with the times and its leaders. This one especially, gives a very special look into the feelings of a somewhat troubled young person. The setting and basis for Marjane's problems is rooted in her life in Iran, but as you read, you see a maturing youth experiencing great discontent with her life. She feels like a misfit. She leans toward anyone who will be her friend. She makes poor choices. She is characteristic of many young people around the world.  I would love to see this book used in highschool literature, history, and psych classes, but blunt language and social indulgences with illustrations probably make it unfit. Again, a fast read. Paragraphs of description found in other books are missing; drawings take their place 
 From "Transfer" to "Like You Want to Believe", i was captured, held hostage, and released from this album wanting even more! After first being exposed to Collide through "Some Kind of Strange", I was eager to get my hands on more of their music. That's when "Chasing the Ghost" came along and swept me away!   "Razor Sharp" became a quick favorite with the lounge-like piano playing in the background accompanied by kaRIN's sultry and fitting vocals. "Dreamsleep" is another favorite of mine. The song stays true to the title, leaving the listener, or at least me, in a very dreamlike state. Adding to your listening pleasure is the cover of Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit," a song I would never expect to hear covered by recent bands, and yet, it almost comes as no surprise being heard on this album. And the band pulls it off very well. As for the rest of the album, it is just as good as the first half. "Ocean" is another sweet-sounding track that will leave you relaxed and energized at the same time.  I cannot fully explain how pleased I was after listening to this album! I love it just as much, if not more than "Some Kind of Strange". I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try something new! This album is truly a gem 
 This book is extremely helpful and easy to follow.  It is also well written by a respected clinician in the field of anxiety.  Dr. Kase has given her audience the tools to enjoy and master the work environment 
 This album deserves your 100% undivided attention. If you don't give it that, shame on you. It is intensely personal and heartfelt. It travels from the darkness of despair to the giddy joy that just being alive on a sunny day can bring. It will take you along for the ride if you let it.  At times it lures you into quiet corners, whispers amazing secrets in your ear and bursts into life like those speeded up flowers opening on nature programmes (The Likes of You). Some moments leave you squirming with delight as the rush travels up your spine in anticipation of the next note. There were times when the vocals were so delicate and fragile that I found myself holding my breath, as if breathing out would somehow spoil the sound.  I'm particularly amazed and impressed with the fantastic use of keyboards and percussion throughout this album. It is a multi layered piece of work with so much depth you can swim in it. The guitars are gorgeous, so perfectly recorded. The vocals are so honest, you can close your eyes and on songs like Cemetary Song and The Year of our Demise, Jon could be right there in the room with you. Songs like Sundown, My Sweet Unknown and Josephine you ride like a wave, others wash over you and get absorbed like an emotional sponge. The drumming throughout is understated, just enough, perfectly complimentary to the music. I think Darius Minwalla shines on this album. The first thing I noticed on My Sweet Unknown was Darius' unmistakeable drumming.  Each time I listen to this album it leaves me wanting to hear it again. It's one of those albums that you wish would never end 
 I bought this a few weeks ago and I must say it was very interesting. While not nearly as funny as the original Batman show, I liked the flashbacks to what was going on in Adam West's and Burt Ward's respective lives during those days! Some may have been shocked by Adam and Burt's former womanizing but to me, that humanized even more in my eyes and I applaud them for having the guts to admit that.   Anyway, for those familiar with the old series, this is a fun romp as they try to solve who stoled the Batmobile! Still, I wish they could've done it a few years earlier while the two other main villians were still alive. By that, I am refering to Ceasar Romero (The Joker) and Burgess Merideth (The Penguin). Since this film was made, Frank Gorshin (The Riddler) has passed on though I am not sure about Julie Newmar as I think she's still alive (I know that Earth Kitt still is as she's also a former Catwoman).  On a personal note, I also have to applaud whoever picked the actors that portrayed the younger versions of Adam and Burt (especially Burt as it was dead on)! I noticed they did had to pad the stomach a bit for the actor who played Adam West because was physically in much better shape than Adam ever was! LOL!   I also liked the hip-hop version of the old Batman theme. It was an updated take on it BUT still true and respectful to the old theme as well as the more disco type one they played when Adam and Burt first put on their costumes for the first day of shooting. While I have nothing against rap and such, many times they tailor it to "being real" and that nonsense! I am glad whoever made those two pieces of music stayed true to the spirit of the show.  Finally, the references to Lyle Waggoner, the man that ALMOST got to play Batman! I liked seeing that rare footage of his screen test and the fact they almost went with the OLD SCHOOL costume (which was the same as Adam's only it was a big black bat on the chest/must like you see now on the Justice League Unlimited cartoon)!  If you buy this feature, then may I recommend you buy BATMAN - THE MOVIE from the 60's with it. And if you do, watch the movie first and I would recommend watching it at least once with the alternative commentary with Adam and Burt as much of what they talk about on that DVD is on the "Return" DVD! This way, you'll have a better understanding of "Return To The Batcave."  On its own, its a great experience for those who remember the series fondly but may be hard for newer fans to follow. I'd recommend it to die-hard Batman fans or to those that really want to know about the 60's TV show 
 This is a first outing for Denzel Washington as an author.  Let me be among the many to congratulate him for a job well done. The central theme of the book is that we, all of us, are standing on the shoulders of others. There are seventy four inspirational, energizing, and motivational examples told to us by people from all walks of life.   Many quotes in the book are poignant, thought-provoking, and stimulating.  I especially liked and agreed with the one by James Baldwin:  "Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them."    Unfortunately, this is true for many young people who have bad role models as parents. Nonetheless the book gives hope and encouragement by showing others have overcome this obstacle with the help of influential organizations like The Girls and Boys Club of America.  Hank Aaron, Muhammad Ali, Bob Woodward,  James Worthy, and many others give heart-rendering examples of mentors who have helped them.    Page thirty four has a fascinating story from Walter Anderson, Editor in Chief,  Parade Magazine (he went to the same Boys Club in Mt. Vernon, NY as Mr. Washington).    He tells an inspiring story of a teacher in his neighborhood who showed him kindness, interest, and devotion.  He remembers prophetic words from her that changed his life:  "You can do this, Walter.  You can do this." Even when he would fail classes, be suspended from school, or have problems with authorities -she would not give up on him.  It is a powerful example of how lives can be influenced not just with money but with support.   Dale Carnegie was right when he said:  "Do not criticize, condemn, or complain." Instead - we should applaud, reward, and help others.  Buy this empowering book, enjoy the uplifting ride, and give someone the hand of encouragement. We can do this.  Reginald V. Johnson, author, "How To Be Happy, Successful, And Rich"     
 Eric Whitacre is a young composer that has the ability to capture emotions and sounds of angelic proportions. His music will take you on a journey that harmonizes the heart and soul. This CD is a compilation of Whitacre's Choral works, where he uses different chord structures within the lyrics to provide a wonderful listening experience that sounds like no other 
 This is an extraordinarily well-written book which may be used as a learning tool for the starting Organic synthetic chemist, who, with no doubt, will enjoy himself by going through it.  Many references are given  after each synthesis, so that the reader can refer to specific journals and  find out the actual reaction conditions that were carried out for each  synthesis.  Also, at the end of the book, a list of several natural  products and their classical preparations are given with their respective  journal citation.  I believe that this book provides the organic syntehtic  chemist with a feel for the area and its boundless applications and limits.   I would recommend this book to anybody engaged in some kind of synthetic  work, since there is good chance that this book will have the answer to  some of their questions 
 Out of Africa is a CD with beautiful music. When I listen to it, I imagine myself in the nature of Africa. You will enjoy it 
 This book dedicates itself entirely to fixing the underlying process of intelligence.  The authors place intelligence in the larger context of information, and draw a plethora of useful comparisons with emerging  private sector capabilities and standards.  They place strong emphasis on  the emerging issues (not necessarily threats) related to ethnic, religious,  and geopolitical confrontation, and are acutely sensitive to the new power  of non-governmental organizations and non-state actors.  The heart of their  book is captured in three guidelines for the new process: focus on  understanding the consumer's priorities; minimize the investment in fixed  hardware and personnel; and create a system that can draw freely on  commercial capabilities where applicable (as they often will be).  Their  chapter on the failure of the bureaucratic model for intelligence, and the  need to adopt the virtual model-one that permits analysts to draw at will  on diverse open sources-is well presented and compelling.  Their concluding  three chapters on analysis, covert action, and secrecy are solid  professional-level discussions of where we must go in the future 
 Orson Scott Card has brilliant way of telling many stories within one story. Meaning, in Xenocide there is lots of depth. I really enjoyed the book. There were MANY times when all the philosophical talk got on my nerves.  But by the end of the book I was satisfied.  Execllent Story. 
 I was very pleased with the sound and video quality of this performance. It looks like a collaboration of different shows pieced together to form one hell of a spectacle. A definate must for any Marilyn Manson fan 
 Since this collection came out when I was in high school, it served as my introduction to John Lennon. I knew alot of Beatles before, and I've collected alot of his solo work since, but this gave me my first listens to "The Balled Of John And Yoko", "Jealous Guy", and my favorite track "Julia". The great things about this soundtrack is that it's 21 tracks long, and 20 of them are wonderful. It also gives you some of his Beatles AND solo material. However, that's also where it lacks. In trying to cover both eras, it misses a huge amount of each. It reminds me of that "Best Of Sting And The Police" collection. I do love this album, and it is nice for just one discs worth, but I would first recommend "Lennon Legend" for his solo years, and of course "Beatles 1" if you want just the tip of that iceberg. 
 Fletcher's book provides a revealing portrait of the Cid, separating the historical man from the myth. The opening chapters provide a glimpse of Spain during the Middle Ages, while the subsequent chapters focus on El Cid. It is a particularly useful book if you are only familiar with Charlton Heston's Cid, or with the epic poem, El Poema del Cid. Thought provoking, and exceptionally well-written 
 Hasia Diner is the Paul S. and Sylvia Steinberg Professor of American Jewish History at New York University. In Lower East Side Memories: A Jewish Place In America, she recounts the history of Manhattan's Lower East Side in terms of its Jewish community, largely populated by immigrants from Eastern Europe. During the years 1880-1930 it was never ethnically (or even religiously) homogenous. It was a place of tenements, poverty, sweatshops, packs of roaming children, a dark warren of pushcart-lined streets and social work pioneering. Professor Diner surveys its popular culture, and the impact of the Lower East Side as an icon symbol upon such diverse venues as children's stories, novels, movies, museum exhibits, television shows, summer-camp reenactments, walking tours, consumer catalogues -- even photos hung on deli walls. After World War II the Lower East Side was enshrined as the portal through which Jews passed from European oppression into the promise of America. After 1960, the Lower East Side gave secularized and suburban Jews a culturally transmitted story of their origins and heritage. Lower East Side Memories is an exceptional, informative, highly recommended history of a community, a heritage, and a cultural identity arising from one of the most distinctive and unique neighborhoods in American twentieth century history 
 This book is a fabulous treasury of traditional patterns with its colorful pictures. All techniques are covered in detail with drawn illustrations. This is, however, by no means a pattern book for a beginner. To construct a certain mitten, the techniques and patterns must be picked out from different parts of the book and put together. On the practical side, the binding of the book could be better; mine is already falling apart and loosing pages after a couple of weeks of use. Nevertheless, I'm very satisfied with the purchase, and will make many of the mittens in this book 
 I was simply overwhelmed by the sweep and depth of this book. It is much more than a collection of essays about Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Johnny Mercer, Peggy Lee et al. It is a brilliantly written history of the  great days of Amerian popular music -- circa 1935-1950 -- with side  excursions into etymology, culture, the art of songwriting, geography,  sociology, linguistics and, above all, musicality. Lees, himself a fine  lyricist, shows and tells how it's done, who did it, where they succeeded  and where they failed, and what finally happened to the era of American  musicianship at its best. For those with the slightest interest in popular  music, this book is a treasure 
 WOW I never would have thought that Season Three would be released so soon. I would have thought that ( creator Donald P. Bellisario) was going to hold off on releasing Season Three; given how long it took him to release the first season. Hopefully more effort has been put into this DVD than the first season.  Once again WOW it is finally her 
 Leopold's essay, "Goose Music" is a classic must read.   Too bad this chapter was left out of the anniversary edition of Leopold's Sand County Almanac 
 I bought this mouse about 14 months back!!! And it's been working great!   Pros: =========== 1. Nice design 2. good looks 3. ergonomic 4. I use it almost 14 hours a day, and need to charge/replace the battery like once in a month 5. good range: i did not need to buy a RC because of this. 6. light weight/small 7. Can rotate the USB transmitter by 90 deg, hence will work even if you have vertical USB slots on your laptop.   Cons: ========== 1. would have liked it more if it had an internal battery and some way of charging it through the USB connection. I use a rechargeable battery, and need to charge it monthly. 
 As a huge fan of Snoop Dogg i couldn't believe it when i first purchased this album. Loads of people said it was his worst cd to date but when i first heard it i couldn't believe how good it was. This is a totally different Snoop Dogg than the one from Death Row. No Limits beats are totally different from Dre's in Death Row but Snoop's lyrics are fantastic. If you are a huge fan of Snoop get this. You won't be dissapointed 
 Amazing. I've read this collection twice so far and I guarantee I will do so many times in the future, huge as it is. The 2nd time, it was like reading a whole new book. There's that much material here - in a good way. There are hundreds, thousands, countless hilarious moments here. These stories (really one big story) take you for the most intricate and wonderful ride through the universe imaginable. It's impossible to communicate how spectacular these books are - they just have to be experienced one insane, glorious piece at a time 
 The second reviewer above misses the point of this book, which is to show the historical relationships between the players in current United States Foreign Policy (e.g., Cheney, Rumsfeld, Negroponte) and the players of the mid-'80s in the Reagan Foreign Policy.  Moreover, his number one point, that no one in "Latin America" killed 3500 Americans (presumably a reference to the attacks of 9/11), sort of misses the obvious fact that no one in Iraq did either.  I think the fact that so many players in Reagan's Iran-Contra clandestine foreign policy have surfaced once again in the current Middle East policy cries out for a book like this.  Buy it and learn more.  
 I love Nora Roberts' books.  I've read most of them and have never been disappointed.  Homeport is the story of Miranda Jones and Ryan Boldari.  Miranda works in the family art business.  She is a renowned specialist in being able to take art pieces and determining how old they are.  Ryan is a thief, a very good one, that comes in to Miranda's life when he steals a piece from her Institute only to find out it's a fake.  Miranda's reputation has already taken a hit because a piece of art she confirmed to be real was also discovered to be fake.  As the two work together, they realize that there are too many coincidences between the two pieces being fake to be ignored.  People close to Miranda are murdered and they both start to realize that they are falling for each other.  The dialogue is great, the story moves at the right pace.  Miranda more than holds her own with Ryan. Ryan is slowly able to break through the barriers Miranda has set up.  The ending wasn't what I expected which was a good thing for me.  I don't like figuring things out too early in a book, it doesn't make the story as interesting.  I highly recommend it 
 Porco Rosso is by far my favorite Miyazaki film due to its witty humor and the anti-war theme.  Althrough kids might not fully understand the movie, none of the content is actually "mature" enough that a whole family cannot enjoy this movie together.  The music and scores are fambulous as usual since Miyazaki and Hisaishi combined both their expertise together FLAWLESSLY.  I admit, I'm the pickiest person when it comes to voices matching personalities, but I really can't complain about the dubbing for this movie.  It is actually enjoyable and believable as opposed to some dubs for other Miyazaki movies.  The script follows the original quite closely.  That makes me happy.  Good Job!  The only thing I had a problem with was that they did not use the original for "Les Temps des Cerises" and the ending theme.  I liked the voice of the original singer (Tokiko Kato) more so then the one they picked (don't know who), but the new one is not bad either.  Many might think that the ending is a bit of a blur, but that's Miyazaki's signature (i.e. watch end credit of My Neighbor Totoro and Nausicaa of Valley of the Wind).  Miyazaki never does sequel of his films, which I fully agree with since somethings are better left unsaid and left to the imagination (which is a theme in most of his movies), but he does give hints throughout the movie on the ending.  As for the actual ending, figure it out for yourself : 
 A great depiction of the opening stages of the Crimean War and the infamous Charge. Steady acting from Hemmings, and a shinning performance from Trevor Howard, both quality British actors.   However for me the films animations made the picture complete, they add depth, meaning and importantly help to bridge the gaps. They depict both the British publics image of a heroic British Campaign against a tyranical Russia, and also the later realisation that war is far from glorious.     Richardsons version improves on almost every apect of the earlier picture staring Errol Flynn, which is seriously inaccurate. Put simply, Richardsons version is perhaps as close to the truth as is possible and in my opinion puts the earlier film to shame. 
 I took a plant I.D. class several years back and this was the text for the class.  This is one of the first books I refer to when trying to learn more about a tree or shrub.  I think only Michael Dirr's books surpass it 
 Easy to learn and follow, kids will draw for hours: 
 Like so many excellent, non-Hollywood films, this one is quiet and subtle.  At times, in fact, you wonder if it is indeed it's going somewhere.  It is, but it takes it's time getting there (time well spent) and it does it in a marvelous, touching way. I rented this film on a whim (saw it on the shelf having never heard of it and thought, "Why not?").  It was a very pleasant surprise, alternately funny and sad, always touching.  When you're tired of car explosions and sexcapades and soulless story telling that inhabits so many of todays films, turn to this one 
 When I first saw this book I thought it would be just another book that I would have to read for English. But as it turned out it was a book that really got me interested and has really changed my life for the better.   This book is a book about 3 young men growing up in the ghetto and changed there life around and made a pact that they would all be doctors when they got older and make it out of the hood,   I am still confused at what made them decide they wanted to be doctors and not anything else? Why did they choose this job?  I defiantly would recommend this book to anyone that is either growing up in the hood or who is in a bad situation and needs to figure out a way to get out and know that it will get better if u just strive for what you really want and set a goal.  
   I don't really understand Mowtown sometimes and this is why. While the Jackson 5 have had many hits with the label its seem as though Berry Gordy and the other label heads forget to promote songs that are actually better than the more famous singles. Case in point, the songs Moving Violation and (You Were Made)Especially For Me should have been hit songs of 1975. For some reason they always thought that other songs were better. They done a great job as a whole but sometimes they really leave you thinking.  Forever Came Today,All I Do Is Think Of You, and Honey Love are also great songs that were actually singles but did not receive the recognition that they deserve.      To me I actally believe this is their best album of their Motown releases. Every song is great and their is no filler here(believe it or not). Michael's vocals were in peak form, and Jermaine's coleads are remarkable as usual. If your a true Jackson fan or fanatic this album is a must have. The Dancing Machine album is also exceptional with standouts being the afformentioned title song, I Am Love, Life Of The Party, and Whatever You Got I Want. These are the last to albums with Motown before they left (minus Jermaine and with brother Randy) to sign with Philadelphia International/Epic. Two great albums one great disc, and a ton of hits you'll be singing for a while!!! 
   My daughter bought this for me for Christmas.  She  down loaded  pictures of all my grandkids  on it.  I just love it.  Easy to carry around  and  you can  add or detract old photos .  A must for anyone  who likes to  show off  children, grandchildren  or pets 
 There is no good way to put this album into words magical enough to describe its sound. Under the Table and Dreaming is bar-none the most amazing CD I have ever purchased. Someone once asked me the question "If you had one album in hell that you had to listen to over and over what would it be?" Under the Table and Dreaming is that album. It is an album that has carried me through 10 years of life changing experiences: High School, College, World Travel, and now "the real world". There is no band in the world that has created a more intricately beautiful sound than DMB, and there is no band in the world that is so dear to my heart. DMB has given me the passion to follow music, and the passion to listen closely to music. If music flows through your soul, creates stunning scenes through your imagination, and you still don't own this album, then it is time, my friend, to buy Under The Table and Dreaming. It is an album that, to this day, remains ultimately my favorite piece of music; an album that I recommend to anyone who truly appreciates the art of sound. 
 During a six week trip around Europe, I had the pleasure of spending about two of them in Eastern and Central Europe ... thanks to Rick Steves' guide, they were among the highlights of the trip.  Eastern Europe has become very tourist-friendly, but (not surprisingly) the tourism infrastructure is still behind Western Europe, so having a high quality guide was extremely beneficial for navigating the sights and finding hotels and restaurants.  While no longer a "back door", Eastern Europe is a wonderful and relatively inexpensive place that will welcome novice and experienced travelers alike.  From the elegant baths of Budapest to the old-world charm of Prague and Krakow, there's a little something for everyone.  Opinionated but informed, Rick Steves' Best of Eastern Europe makes for an excellent traveling companion 
 At first I thought it would be a NY vs Chicago type of thing, which it wasn't.  However, you hear very little about Chicago, except during interviews with Frankie Knuckles, or about Ron Hardy.  That would be the only negative aspect of the film I observed.  This film gives a clear distinction between NY Dance and Chicago House.  I appreciate the fact that at no time did it feel like a competition-of-sorts.  When a time line is presented to you, it's very hard to argue with it.  And, each group's sound is distinct unto itself.  But, it's still all "FAMILY"  The phrase "UNDERGROUND" is used too loosely these days.  When it comes to music genre(s), NY Dance/Chicago House are true Underground music.  You can't deny it when major record labels, as a whole, refuse to include original dance/house tracks on major releases.  But, they are more than happy to let DJs/Re-mixers/Producers put out separate "authorized" productions.  You are truly "underground" when the bottom line does-not-compute.  In closing, I would ask the younger people/dancers to research the history of "The Circle".  This portion of the DVD made me shiver; it hit so close to home.  Complete your journey by researching CAPOEIRA, an Afro-Brasilian martial art originating back more than 300 years ago.  In the film, the dancers couldn't hold in their joy, their desire, their NEED to be a part of The Circle.  Your Circle, called The Roda (pronounced Ho-dah) and the acrobatics involved are linked directly to Capoeira.  Every aspect of the dancers' experiences, described in the film, are "exactly" what Capoeira is all about.  This could be an avenue Josell Ramos could investigate.  JACK IT UP................. Keep House/Dance Alive!!!!!!! 
 This book is essential if you are considering a career in any aspect of the music business. For example, If you started out with a home studio and want to branch out further, then this is the book for you. If you are a songwriter with a bunch of songs laying around but don't know what to do with them, this book is for you. It is one of the best 20 bucks I have since I began in the music business 
 This book has helped me as a young college student, to explore different life cases of people in deviant lifestyles. I usethis book as required text in a "deviant behavior" class. I found a lot of stories. There  are a lot of interesting topics, it is a good discussion starter 
 That is the best way to describe this book.  This is my favorite book of all time about Feminist Spirituality and Witchraft and the leading book I use for my personal Spirituality 
 Chicken Soup for the Soul By: Jack Canfield Reviewed by: M. Ke P.2     Chicken Soup for the Soul is a series of short stories that often portray drama. The series would often describe people living with cancer conditions or people that are mentally disabled. I believe that the book's purpose is to make you happy for the person you are.     I liked the book, mainly because it cheers me up. This book not only makes your heart smile, but also your soul smile, with quotes such as: "Don't bug me! Hug me!" and even made the people who are the most crippled smile.      The second reason why I liked this book is because of the drama. There are some stories in the book at this play this such as: "I cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again." or people suffering under a medical condition such as: "The 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who dying of terminal leukemia." For this one, this amuses me more than comedy.     My favorite park in this series is a short story called "The Hugging Judge." It tells about a kind-hearted judge who would go around hugging everyone he sees. When he is sent to a place for the mentally stupid people, he is pleaded a hug an old man named Leonardo. It is said that because of that, the old man smiled, in the first time during 23 years 
 Well Michael you have done it again! The Enemy Within is a straight forward no-holds-bar bearer of the truth. Savage is a cynic and a man who needs anger management but he has never been closer to the truth. Sometimes we fail to see or don't want to see the obvious in front of our eyes. The Enemy Within forces you to open up your eyes and take off the blinders and see what is really going on in our great country. This book could start a movement to retake our country back from the oligarchy that has held it hostage for too long. If I could do one thing, that would be to plead with you to read this book. Let's band together and change America, bring it back to the way our founding Fathers wanted it to be.  Instead of the cesspool it is evolving into.

 Got the book quickly - and in good shape - Thank yo 
 For an inexpensive pizza stone, it does the job.  If you're looking for something that is more versatile, look somewhere else.  This stone is primarily for breads, pizza and the like.  I know this because I tried baking cookies on it. The cookies turned out fine, but they stuck to the stone. However, when I make home made pizza from scratch, the crust comes out perfect! Not too soft, not too crisp. It bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust 
 I love, love my set!  You have fun colors to choose from and they don't disappoint in person!  There is a half way measuring line in each bowl to make it really nifty!  When I first got them, I dropped the whole set from counter height. I was worried about cracking the plastic bowls.  And was happy to find all were in perfect shape regardless of my little mishap!  So, they are durable, stylish and extremely useful!   I say buy a set, you won't be disappointed 
 One of the most stunning cd's I own, is Falling Into You.  It's so fantastic and has so many great songs on it.  You know how sometimes you have a great cd but you don't like all the songs on it?  Well for me, this isn't the case.  I love them all.  And considering this has 16 songs on it, it's a great testament on how great Celine is.  Maybe she doesn't write her own music, but she sings so incredibly well.   If I had to pick my usual three best songs, I'd say they are If That's What It Takes, I Don't Know and Call The Man.  It's hard to narrow it down to only three good songs because they are all good.  There are her usual powerful ballads (Seduces Me, Because You Loved Me to name a few) and some more upbeat songs like Declaration Of Love and River Deep, Mountain High.  A really classy song is It's All Coming Back To Me Now.  It's 7.37 minutes long but it's amazing.  Yes I know some people can't appreciate her talent, but if you are someone how enjoys a powerful singer with a good range and ability, then this is for you.  It's so good and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do 
 Manuel Duran and Fay Rogg have written a book that is more than a study of the classic, "Don Quixote" by Miguel de Cervantes. The Introduction lifts a curtain on a world that was tragic and comical, material and spiritual.The clear associations of the real and the fictional characters as well as the use of fables to illuminate and predict the present and the future, made me consider Don Miguel as more than an author much as Leonardo Da Vinci was more than an artist.We are drawn into the life of Don Quixote so that we ourselves encounter his worlds with a  richer perspective on life in general than we have experienced before.There is history as well as poetry in this book, think of it as a fine voyage to experience as summer vacations or retreats from daily duties approach us.  
 This review is for Ultimate Spider-Man vol. 3 paperback edition: Double Trouble  Doctor Octopus has long been one of Spider-Man's greatest villains, and this volume sees his entrance into the Ultimates world. Horribly disfigured after his accident in Osborn lab's in volume one, Otto Octavius insane and out for blood. Add into the mix, Kraven, who fancies himself the world's ultimate hunter, and his new prey is Spider-Man.   Once again, Bendis bring his best game when scripting this book. The writing is wonderful, the characters very real and very human. His take on Gwen Stacy is very unlike mainstream Gwen Stacy but the result is a very likable character. His approach to Mary Jane and Peter's relationship is also very teenage and appealing.   Bagley and Thibert's pencils are nice, and appropriate to the book, though the character's are a little wide eyed at times, and their take on Doc Ock's body didn't mesh with my personal image of the character.   This is the perfect Ultimate Spider-Man graphic to buy for someone who has seen Spider-Man 2 and wants to read a comic with Doc Ock in it. This book is also appropriate for all ages and for comic collectors and newcomers alike.   This volume reprints Ultimate Spider-Man #14-21. Highest recommendations 
 I like how mainstream and safe dis sounds. It makes me feel like I'm normal when I'm teh not. Makes me feel like I belong. Lots of people like Brit, and I can see why! Some of the songs I actually like deep down inside the production is great on dis CD. She sings so well. The instruments play and she sings to da songs. All music should be dis good 
 This record has the driving power you'd expect from a Rolling Stones record. It just makes you want to raise your hand in a fist and shake it, especially during "Neighborhood Bully" and "Man of Peace," a song I really love, but must admit to having a hard time understanding. Sometimes I think it means one thing, sometimes another. Sometimes Bob Dylan can be sort of ambiguous and I suppose that's why millions of people dissect everything he's ever done. This record is simply a must have for any Dylan, Rock and Roll or even an Rolling Stones fan 
 The Andromeda Strain is a story about a virus that was exposed to a small town in Arizona, Piedmont.  Piedmont was a desolate ton to begin with, and only got worse after a strange and unknown virus took the lives of all the citizens, save two.  This is when the story begins to get juicy.  These two survivors, a small child and an old man, are then transferred to a maximum security laboratory in Nevada.  From here a team of scientists work toward investigating the virus.   	As I was reading I often became confused and sidetracked, in particular in the beginning, when Michael Crichton explained the background information on the team of scientists.  That section was not especially necessary and somewhat useless.  However, quickly I came to find that the book would take a turn for the best when the plot became exciting and interesting.  The story in roughly the fifth and sixth chapters became interesting when the team of scientists were sent to work on the case in Nevada.  If I were to recommend this novel, I would recommend this book to science fiction fanatics and people interested in a virology or bacteriology field.   I, personally am not much of a science person but I too was entertained and enthralled all the way throughout.  I wouldn't change much except the scientific terminology.  Overall, I felt the book was very good and it maintained my attention throughout the entire book.     
 first off i gotta say that i loved the mallorens, so i may not be the most impartial reviewer. i liked "an unsuitable man" mostly because the female lead, was a strong woman, who took a some hard knocks, picked herself right back up, got on with her life and went after the things she knew would make her happy. i'm not gonna get into plot at all, the book flowed well and kept my interest from cover to cover 
 Most of the publications that come out of CCL (or Center for Creative Leadership), which I have acquired for my personal library, are seemingly well-supported by research findings & concisely written by the respective authors, who apparently hold impeccable track records in their fields. This particular book is one of them. (CCL has earned its #1 Rank in Leadership Education by Business Week).  My primary interest in strategic leadership stems from my relentless search for better understanding of the thinking processes that go inside the heads of leaders. To be more precise, the strategy formulation processes!  This has been by burning passion for more than two decades.  In this book, the authors have artfully as well as  logically demonstrated how readers can exercise effective strategic leadership through their distinctive & systematic approach:  -	strategic thinking (Chapter 2); -	strategic acting (Chapter 3); -	strategic influencing (Chapter 4);  These serve as the synergistic driving forces. In the authors' own words: Driving strategy as a learning process.  (I am actually quite tempted to use the term, `syn-vergent' instead of `synergistic' [driving forces] as the former term was originally coined by Michael Gelb, in Thinking for a Change, which means `the art of balancing convergent and divergent thinking modes, logic and imagination, reason and intuition.' In the current book under review, the authors contend that strategic thinking engages the heart as well as the head.)  With an excellent introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 6 shows how readers can apply the above approach in the broader organizational context.   Chapter 7 sums up the book: Becoming a Strategic Leader, using surfing as a metaphorical platform (I like it!) - keeping your balance while learning the best path to follow amid constantly changing conditions.  Throughout the book, the authors discuss in depth the specific competencies & perspectives related to each of the above driving forces, as well as their interdependency in producing a more wholistic (or more appropriately, `syn-vergent', as explained above) & meaningful strategy.  In conclusion as a whole from the standpoint of reader friendliness & action-packed learning, I rate this wonderful book a 5.   So, readers, please add this book to your Strategic Thinker's Bookshelf.   Attention Readers: To complement as well as to reinforce your understanding of Chapter 2 of this book, please read `Choosing the Future: The Power of Strategic Thinking', by Stuart Wells.   
 My five-year-old son loves this book.  The first time, I read it out loud to him and his sister.  He has read it alone several times since then.  I think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he doesn't finish it in fifteen minutes.  The story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example, how Elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles.   I also asked my son what he liked about it, and he said, "Dragons."  He might have given a longer answer if he hadn't been busy reading the book at the time 
 This DVD is an excellent follow up to the first salsa dvd. After learning all the moves and wowing everyone at my local salsa club, I was excited to see that a new video was released! Just in time for summer. And once again with the very mesmerizing instructor Gigi! This DVD has an amazing energy flow that will inspire you to learn more complicated and eye popping moves that will fool people into thinking you spent TONS OF MONEY on your very own salsa instructor. Funny thing is purchasing this Salsa DVD is even better and very affordable for all! Perfecting my moves with Gigi and Pedro will last me a lifetime of salsa club dancing! 
 I've used TurboTax for 3 years now! And again this year the software is the easiest way ever to do your taxes. Now I don't dread waiting till the last minute. I love to see the "Federal Tax Due" box get smaller and smaller. It is easy to download - no problems like some software. If you have the time to work on your own taxes then I suggest this program. Need help with a question - you can use the help box, get live help... 
 Since I work at a library I always have access to plenty of interesting books. So I guess it should come as no suprise that I stumbled upon this at work one day. I become even luckier when I found a copy for sale in our book sale. This book is very interesting to say the least. It brings up the theory that mankind's developement wasn't linear, but cycilical. It boldy proposes that at the dawn of the last ice age mankind was in a golden period of wisdom and technological advances but was nearly wiped out and the suriviors left clues around the globe. This book brings up some interesting points that leave you wondering if maybe this could be real. For the most part this book is well written except sometimes Hanncock seems to repeat himself like a brokenrecord and sometimes he spends time attacking his detractors, which by the end of the book almost had me laughing. I wish there were more maps and pictures eventhough there are plenty but sometimes when it would be most helpful to have a picture or diagram/map there is none. Overall an enjoyable and interesting read; I wouldn't pay the $75 for it though. Either get the softback or check it out from a libray 
 I am a home health Physical Therapist who deals with many "couch potatoes" This book gives great ideas for getting people with low motivation to begin moving.  It also provides a way to progress the exercises.  The explanations of body mechanics and anatomy have helped me with patients who may not understand more technical jargon 
 Mr. Eisner explain the applications of the skills fostered by the fine arts educational experience. Giving especific examples, the author illuminates the dark side of the fine arts usefullness. On chapter four (soul of the book) deals with what can be expected from the fine arts experience and the real application of the acquired skills. More important, Eisner highlight the fact that the student has a self motivated and intrinsic satisfaction experience when learning thru the arts, something quite difficult to achieve with academics matters 
 Who knew I could get this caught up in the exploits of a maverick submarine commander?  Once again the author brings us an over-the-edge tale backed up by a wealth of detail that lends an air of chilling reality to the story line.  Sasgen is a good writer.  He has the seldom seen ability to seamlessly integrate background description - locale, details of submarine operation -into the story without slowing down the pace of the action.  Sasgen handles the "politics" cooly, constructing a spare reality that has this reader thinking "it really could happen" and hoping that somewhere in the submarine service there  is a "Jake Scott. 
 Very few books that I have read about Hitler go into this level of detail.  He was an uneducated loner, born in Austria. He was desperate to be a part of Germany and ran to fight for Germany in the first world war. He was brave under fire. He couldn't get over Germany's defeat and blamed the Social Democratic Liberals, the Unions, the Marxists and of course the Jews. He hated organised labour and never held a job.  When he was homeless and living in a men's shelter in Vienna, he wore a long raincoat and looked like the dirt poor Jewish immigrants roaming the streets of Vienna. Strangely his closest friends in the men's shelter were Jewish fellows who helped him out. While the other men in the men's shelter were out in the streets doing mundane jobs to bring in a few extra pennies, Hitler stayed indoors at the mens shelter and read up to 3 newspapers everyday, studying them in depth.   When his "Movement" (ie National Socialism) started to take off in 1929, he was an insomniac and worked right through the night. He loved eating candy and never drank, smoked or socialised much with woman. He was a small little nothing who couldn't look anyone in the eyes, until you spoke to him about race or politics. Then the man was transformed, became loud, aggressive and obnoxious. He loved to lecture people about race and National Socialism.  The book is long (700 + pages)...it goes into immense detail regarding Napoleon Bonaparte, the depression, the collapse of the German government and why the Germans of that era loved marching and military-like functions.  Strangely, prior to becoming chancellor of Germany, Hitler was terrified of the German police and of getting deported, because he was an Austrian foreigner. After the Putsch, he kept a low profile to avoid getting arrested again. As his fame grew and more and more of the ultra rich (especially in big industry like mining), financed him, he started getting into the habit of having his chaffeur drive him around Berlin aimlessly. People would get excited when they saw him and he loved the attention.  The book maintains that it was the war that transformed Hitler from a homeless nobody into a mesmerizing and charasmatic speaker. He was supposedly a political genius. He had a very low regard for all other people (from his experiences gathered in his homeless years). He loathed the German intellectuals and peasantry whether they had blonde hair and blue eyes or not. He saw no value in the life of individual people but only cared about the group value in the survival of the German volk.  It was a tough book to read. But there are not too many books written by people who actual saw Hitler rise from a nothing and a nobody to a dictator. The book was written PRIOR to the world becoming aware of the holocaust. So except for the numerous speaches of Hitler where he constantly says that "The Jew is to blame for EVERYTHING", there is not much reference to the cataclysm that occurred when this animal came to power.  
 Mr. Hamill takes on every bit of New York and discusses why he loves even the worst parts of it. He crafts a walk downtown thru the 1800's past buildings and men who shaped this city and produces a novel that inspires 
 I picked this book, because I read "The Da Vinch Code" and I wanted to check out other Dan Brown books. I actually bought the small paperback and after finish reading it, I found out that there was a Special Illustrated Edition of this book, and I had to have it! Because when I was reading the small paperback without the illustrations, it was hard to imagine the places.  I wish I knew about this Illustrated Edition. I loved it! In my opinion, "Angeles and Demons" is better than "The Da Vinch Code". I have heard that "Angeles and Demons" is going to be a movie. If it's true, I could hardly wait. And I hope it's not going to be like the movie version of "The Da Vinch Code" 
 This movie deserves all the awards it can get.  All the great reviews it got did not lie.  For once, I agree with the critics 
 Jessica Simpson is both a fine singer and actress,however, she does not compare with the originals like Berlin or Catherin Bach.Which she copied in Take My Breath Away and Dukes of Hazard.   Kip_Tyler2 
 Private school for Girls is a really Cheesy B movie from the 1980's starring Pheobe Cates (who starred in such greats as "fast times at Ridgemont High" and "Gremlins") and Matthew Modine (star of the classic "Vision Quest). This movie is certainly one their worst, but for B movie fans it's phenomenal.   One of the best scenes (other then the topless Betsy Russel horse riding scene) is the shower scene. One of the guys sneaks into the girls locker room and hides in the sauna. The song "I love candy" comes on and the girls come in for a shower. Everytime I hear that song I think of private school for girls. I own the VHS and I have already pre-ordered the DVD version. Hopefully it will remain un-cut from the original. 
 They are everywhere.  We would be living in a fairytale world if we didn't have to deal with the dragons...those "Power Freaks."  But since this is the real world we need the dragon fighting sword that our "Knight in Shining Armor" Weiner has supplied us with.  He has described almost every possible power freak you might encounter in life and has supplied us with ways to deal with them.  "Power "Freaks" is an easy reading book and takes no time at all to get through.  The dragons aren't as frightening after all...you just need to know how to deal with them.  I recemmend it highly 
  I bought the book and also the two CD's of the book for listening to when I am going to sleep at night. I found the book helpful, so also bought the Cd set that is the audio book.  I can refer to the book whenever I need a lift, but the Cd's are a relief sometimes to the "old" eyes.  I have bought different books and audio cd's by other spiritually motivating writers, and am not dissapointed in this one. It is the first time I bought anything written by this author and look forward to future publications.  It gives hands on information that is useful to help yourself improve your life and shape it the way you want it to be.  
 who introduced me to this book. I was a naive child and this book began an incredible journey for me. Buy it, read it and then buy the rest. You'll love them... one drawback I've found would be the detailed explanations about the wildlife. I get a little lost in that but it doesn't detract from this wonderful series. This is book one 
 Although this deserves less than four stars, I decided to give it 4 instead of 3. Kim's sophomore effert def. had a more pop feel to it. However I love the tracks "Custom Made," "How Many Licks?," & "I'm Human." But there are some lame/boring tracks like "Aunt Dot," "Queen B**** Part 2," & the first single "No Matter What They Say." In closing, this is still a must have cd for Kim fans 
 While some might fault Mr. Carter for missing some of the deeper philosophical ambiguities of the integrity and ethics questions, at the same time, he also misses a large segment of elitist abstract and obstruse  arguments that make no impression on the normal people who are the American  democracy.  Mr. Carter does the nation a great service by stating the  obvious (which if it was really obvious, wouldn't need stating in book  length) in language that is sufficient but not difficult and using  examples, that, while some might decry the close historical distance, are  examples of things that are still close enough to be common knowledge, and  thus, readily understandable without long explanation 
 Dr. Hendrix is the creator of the imago model, which is more or less a breakthrough way for finding and solving various relationship problems. Thanks to it everyone can easily discover the very reasons for even the most serious problems that plague marriages and freeze love, respect and intimacy. I think that it ranks in importance with bestsellers such as lies at the alter and scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. One of the best things about getting the love you want is that it is directly applicable regardless of whether you want to get deeper understanding about yourself or a relationship. What makes it so valuable are the different tools that Dr. Hendrix has developed and used for a long time and are guaranteed to help you understand and solve many problems as well as to eliminate the underlying reasons. There are also examples which will calm you down especially if you think that your situation is very bad. Even if it is, this book provides 16 exercises which you can use right away together with your beloved one and start solving any problem right away. It is definitely one of the bestsellers, which I believe that every single and married person should have and often refer to 
 Trust Peter Gabriel to blaze this trail, leading a small horde of other musicians and artists to follow in his footsteps.  Much of what has come after has been of the cookie-cutter and imitation variety, but this album, to me anyway, is the foundation stone of what I like to think of as Tribal Techno.  The various samples of indigenous-speak are skillfully woven into the pleasant synthetic music, or is it the synthetic music being woven into the tribal-talk?  Hard to say, as it could go both ways.  I recommend this album for collectors of New Age and electronic music especially, as it really has become a classic in the years since its release.  This is also the strongest of all the Deep Forest albums, much in the same way that the original Enigma and Delerium releases continue to be the strongest among their respective sets 
 Whether it's your first camcorder or whether you're moving into digital video from analog, you need Digital Video For Beginners, a guide which goes beyond the owner's manual: one that covers all the basics from choosing the right camera to using it efficiently and getting great shots from vacations, events and more. The examples are quick and easy to follow whether you're reading cover-to-cover or looking for quick answers. A handy little guide which should've been packed with every digital video. 
 You know the author is good when he can make you tear up for a former KKK member on Death Row. While the book was a little slow at times, I couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happens next. If you like John Grisham, you'll like this book. 
 It's hard to believe 20 years have passed since "My Life As A Dog" hit the international circuit and captured the hearts of audiences worldwide.  Here it is again and the story has lost nothing of its relevance. Young, Anton Glanzlius gives a powerful, amazing, unaffected and emotionally enormous portrait of a young boy who's world is falling apart and who learns to cope and accept the new direction life takes him.  I could go on and on, but don't need to.  Anyone who has seen this film already knows, and anyone who hasn't seen it, simply must.  One of the best Swedish films I know.  Certainly one of the most loved.     
 This book is very well written. The characters depicted and the nature of the setting succinctly captures college campus life where there is sex, rivalries, friendship, peer pressure, identity search, some education and sports. This highly entertaining book by a remarkable writer should be treated seriously. I also liked The usurper and other stories, Night Fall  
 Alfred Lord Tennyson impresses the reader with his unique talent of writing poetry.  He writes a series of poems based on myths, legends, epics and so on to produce a work so skillfully written, one's eyes could be glued to the book in marvel at the fine imagery he creates to tell his story.  Much of his poems are based upon King Arthur's period of time.  His representaion of the era accentuates a period in time when he was named Poet Laruette.  His skill and passion for writing captures the minds of those who seek love as well for those who strive for adventure.  As this book has a wide selction of tales to tell, one of my all-time favorite poems for some reason is, Lady of Shallott.  Tennyson's sharp use of words inspired many artists that turned is words of imagery into a painting.  After reading this book, try browsing the web or search through art books to find what faomous paintings there are that were influenced by Tennyson.  This book I would highly recommend to those who especially enjoy reading poetry, for Tennyson is one of the most well-known and most talented poets the world has yet to know 
 I am glad that I read this book.  It was sweet, suspenseful and funny.  I laughed aloud many times.  I also liked Fairy Tale but thought that this was better 
 Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15.  Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life.  I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life 
 I have all 3 CDs - the Wreck, the rerelease, and the import. The music is amazing and so refreshing. I keep 1 in the car, 1 at home, 1 in the computer. See my site at Anna Nalick dot com! She is so very talented- much more than any "star" or "singer' out there today. AND she writes her own music & lyrics! Rock on, Anna, we love ya 
 What a delight, finding a cookbook with everything my mother cooked but I didn't ask for the how to's. I've tried many many of these recipes and they were great. My mom threw in a bit of this a pinch of that a palm.. of this other but I never wrote them down. Now I know quantities for many many of mom's dishes. Thanks Marguerti

 Please read the review,  Reviewed by Karen Henry ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Karen Henry is an Arab-American free-lance writer and lecturer from Michigan. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  She knew how to talk in the night. With words alone, she could put us onto a large ship sailing from Aden to the Maldives, or take us to an island where the birds spoke like human beings. [We] traveled so far that no gods were to be found, only sun-and-fire worshippers, but even they seemed friendly and endearing when introduced by Aunt Habiba. Her tales made me long to become an adult and an expert storyteller myself. I wanted to learn how to talk in the night. (page 19)   We enter each chapter of Dreams of Trespass through an exquisite photograph and are held there by the magic of Fatima Mernissi's words, proving that she has indeed become an expert storyteller. Mernissi's memoir about her childhood in an urban domestic harem in Fez in the late 1940s recounts the life experiences of her female relatives and her own reactions to the world around her. The book demystifies the harem and puts a face on Arab Muslim women in a personal and highly entertaining manner, exploring the nature of women's power, the value of oral tradition, and the absolute necessity of dreams and celebrations.   The comfort of tradition is recognized and celebrated while women's advances and past accomplishments also are applauded. The strong women characters-mother, grandmothers, aunts, cousins-have different responses to and methods for coping with restricted life in a harem. Fatima's mother celebrated her daughter's birth with the same level of enthusiasm usually reserved for boy babies; she claimed male superiority was nonsense and anti-Muslim. The nationalists' struggle against French rule and for gender equality gave strength to the women's occasional acts of rebellion. The intimacy of harem life allowed eight-year-old Fatima to observe and to participate as well as to question endlessly in order to understand what was happening in changing Morocco.   Her grandmother Yasima, although also part of a harem, lived on a farm where the women had access to the outdoors. She grew plants and rode horses, redesigned her clothing for more freedom of movement and told Fatima that the days were near when men would have only one wife and women would be equally educated. As the men held on to tradition, with the support of some of the women, most women argued for equality and change and found ways to express their desires. For example, cousin Chama and Aunt Habiba staged elaborate plays celebrating famous women's lives with all the women and children of the harem (and occasionally the young men) participating as members of the production or members of the audience. These plays helped Fatima decide that singing, dancing and sensuality were part of the feminists' lives and should not be forgotten; sensuality is a refreshingly natural part of life throughout the book.   In Dreams of Trespass we glimpse a world of Arab women struggling to maintain some aspects of tradition while emerging into a modern and freer world. As the women identify the nature and limitations of their power and the opportunities for change, they do not abandon their dreams. Mernissi tells us on page one that the women dreamed of trespassing all the time and that the world beyond the gate was their goal. But how they got to that world was an important part of achieving their goals: Confronting Ahmed (the gatekeeper) at the gate was a heroic act. Escaping from the terrace was not, and did not carry with it that inspiring, subversive flame of liberation. (page 60)   The power of the oral tradition, a tradition very important to the Arabs, is manifest in this book as it opens worlds, creates variety, provides sensuality and inspiration. Fatima's Aunt Habiba, who could take her listeners all over the world, says: When you happen to be trapped powerless behind walls, stuck in a dead-end harem, you dream of escape. And magic flourishes when you spell out that dream and make the frontiers vanish. Dreams can change your life, and eventually the world. Liberation starts with images dancing in your little head, and you can translate those images into words. And words cost nothing. (page 113.)   Magic flourished throughout this book as it educated and entertained us. It is wonderfully written and has the power to open Western eyes to a world often objectified and trivialized. In the process, it creates a new appreciation and understanding for the varied lives of Arab women.   
 This is only essential for hardcore Steinbeck fans, but his insight and singular turns of phrase pervade this prolific collection.  Of particular note is his homage to his three best teachers, less than two pages long, called "...like captured fireflies."  America and Americans is dated in parts, but his takes on corporations and America's obsession with children are prescient, and his indefatigable optimism essential.  A different resonance than the novels, but of the same calibur.  
  Mary Roach has to be one of the most talented writers out there. Her ability to take any ordinary fact and draw you in is much to be admired.  The book has some slow parts where the same information is dragged out for pages, but overall it is very informative and entertaining. 
 First, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to anyone. There are terrific dancing and singing routines by both Hepburn and Astaire, it's well-acted, and very entertaining. It's both antiquated and modern. It has one foot in the future (the 28-year-old Hepburn) and one foot in the past (the 58-year-old Astaire). It's that second aspect that I find most interesting.   What a propaganda piece this 1957 movie is, saturated with the assumptions of the American Century, and a wish-fulfilling monument to the blacklist's disintegrating empire. It is a propaganda piece against the evils of free thought, women's independence, and, of course, anything even vaguely associated with radical thinking. The film does this cleverly, by personifying all of these evils in the lovely Audrey Hepburn. It sets her up as an idealistic, anti-corporate, free-thinking young woman disinterested in cosmetics and fashion, and slowly takes her apart until the concluding scene where she is a celebrated model, in the arms of the suave fashion photographer outside a church in Paris, ready for marriage. Total surrender, a woman broken. And thus the happy ending. In a few brief days, she has learned that ideologies, as symbolized by her "impracticalism" are malarkey, foreign, and preached by lecherous hypocrites. Paris is reduced to a playground, a setting for romance and sensuality, and how dare it purport to be a source of intellectual strength? Hey, we bailed their butts out just a few years earlier. They got nothing. And her early criticisms of Astaire, the fashion photographer, for wasting his talent, are sufficiently answered by his brief point about making money. Argument over. It's pragmatism, dancing behind the scenes as energetically as Astaire and Hepburn. This is the kind of stuff Klaatu warned us about back in 1951.   Hepburn will trace a parallel but more psychologically complex path 4 years later in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", but at least she'll end up in the arms of a struggling writer more her age, and I think Breakfast is a little more sensitive to the dilemmas women face in our society. I guess Truman Capote didn't feel the hot breath of Senator Joseph McCarthy breathing down his neck. But that's a whole other story.   Hey, wouldn't it be interesting if someone wrote a story that pretended the Hepburn characters were real in Funny Face and Tiffany's, and then filled in the time between the two movies? She marries Astaire, then leaves him, she moves out to the country, meets Ebsen, etc. etc.  
 Having read and loved other books by McKinley (The Blue Sword being one of my absolute favorite books of all time, The Hero and the Crown and Beauty are also very, very good) I was excited to read this book.   It was very clever, the characterizations were excellent--especially how the animals stay animal, and aren't turned into furry humans for the purpose of the book.  Also, McKinleys gift for bringing fantasy worlds alive is demonstrated elegantly in this novel. The magic unique from that in other novels--its quirky and has a mind of its own.   This book got four stars instead of five for the following reasons:  If you are looking for action-packed adventure more like The Blue Sword, you may be somewhat dissapointed. There is a fair bit of excitement and drama, but the action is of a different sort, less swords and more magic. There is also alot more slow less-exciting bits inbetween, most of it does become important later, but I'll say again, its not an action-packed adventure story.   Also, the ending was very confusing. After re-reading I sort of understood what was going on, but I didn't quite understand the why and how of all of it. Still, it has my highest reccomendations, especially to see McKinley use what I think to be her greatest talent as a writer: the complete realization of a new world. 
 Ralph has accomplished something quite amazing here on several levels.   There's the beautiful sound he coaxes out of his guitars.   There's his truly unique style of music composition.   And there's his incredible guitar playing, which is harmonically and rhythmically very deep and soulful.   And he's doing it ALONE, live on stage.   Incredible.    In addition to being a great guitar player, he's an accomplished pianist as well!    I think the combination of these two is what has helped give him such a truly unique style on the guitar.   The sounds you will hear on this disc will touch you very deeply.   You can almost feel Ralph breathe and move with this music as he's playing it.   He's so honest in his performance that you can't help but be drawn into it.    Particularly amazing to my ears was hearing his take on Miles Davis' "Nardis".   To  improvise on a theme like that and get deep into it and come up with something rewarding, and to do it on a guitar all alone with no other instruments supporting you....to me that is amazing, and it shows how special Ralph Towner is.       This album will never sound old or out of date.   Please do yourself a favor and buy it now 
   I am coming in late on Mr. Elder's thoughts regarding America, but after reading this book, most ALL of what he has to say...I've already thought about at one point or another.    That's NOT to say it's just another "rehash"...quite the contrary. Larry speaks his mind, using common sense approaches and everyday analogies to show each of us that we don't have to labor under the banner of "victimology", whatever race we are.    He states that WE are in control of ourselves, and that WE should be accountable to ourselves first and foremost.      There is NO free ride in Mr. Elder's book, or his rhetoric. And that's a refreshing change of pace from all that we hear and see today.     Victicrats, beware 
 Masters' Spoon River Anthology is as poignant today as when it was written. Part glimpse of history, part poetic essay on the eternal frailties of the human animal, the epitaphs are riveting from first to last. Read it. Then get a spoken word recording. Then read it again. You'll find these characters live on 
 A gem of a book! Too often, stories of the experience of imperialism are scrubbed to fit in with more modern sensibilities instead of staying true to the authentic tale. This book is glorious for the truth of the voices and the attitudes, morals and viewpoints that were the norm for the time. Invaluable to understanding what life was really like, and what motivated those who were the Raj. This was a wonderful read, completely free from political correctness and censorship. Finally a book that seemed to tell the tale as it was. The book flows well, the stories are engaging, the language is crisp and clear, and valuable information is present on every page. There is no attempt to portray the people as anything other than who they were, they are allowed to tell their own stories. I'm very thankful that someone realised how valuable this material would be to future generations and took the steps to capture it while it was still available 
 If you saw the movie- this is a great music cd- if you did not see the movie it is  a fantastic cd to use while reading. Keepp them flying.. 
 I resent the fact that this book is being categorized as fiction.  As a Catholic and for the other 5 million people in this world who visit this site annualy we certainly do not do so because we believe in fairy tales,  it is because we look in hope at something much greater than this world can  offer and that is the miracle working power of our Lord and Savior Jesus  Christ.  There have been thousands of documented cures, physically as well  as thousands more spiritually.  This is not only an inspiration for others  but it is a book that will change your life, LITERALLY 
 the best cd i have ever heard period. I'm not even a big metheny fan but him n lyle outdid themselves with this cd, it's nothing short of amazing, every single track. 
 This was a fantastic book, though at times, a little obscure for readers outside the shipping and transportation business. The shipping container's impact on the every ones daily life ranks up there with the printing press,  the transistor, communication systems, duct tape, the calculator and the Internet.  While the general public derieve use and benefit from all of the above mentioned things, without ever thinking about them, they all have made a big difference in our lives. People who enjoy this book should read and view some of James Burkes' books and TV seriers (ex BBC), which chronicle small, unusual and un noted events, innovations and inventions which changed how we all live. The shipping container is only one of these events throughout history 
 Not the best in the series, but has some great artists. This is one I can listen to over and over and over and not get tired of it. A must have for your "Rama" collection 
 Astrology is a hard science to master,which is why this book  is so brilliant. Grant Lewi takes a number of complex astrological concepts and converts them into something which is usable by, and useful to, the layman.Even if you know nothing about astrology, you could construct your own chart in less than 30 minutes . This book is not 100% accurate as it only takes into consideration major aspects such as the trine,sextile, opposition. square  or conjunction .Also ,the moon positions might not be completely accurate.For eg. 23 january 1985 says moon in aquarius while a person born on that day might have a moon in pisces owing to latitude differences .However, the fact remains that this  is an excellent start for those who want to know more about astrology  considering it has tables from the year 1870 to 2050 as well as 277 aspects 
 This series is the best that has come along since the Seinfeld era.  Denny Chrane, Denny Chrane, Denny Chrane.  What more can I say 
 All I keep hearing about is this new talent war ... people want to leave their jobs, they're not giving their effort, the boomers are leaving, the X'ers aren't staying.  In the meantime, businesses are starting to pick up and it's obvious we're not going to have the right people available to do what's needed.  So out comes this book ... makes sense?  What's even better is it's simple.  There's tons of to-do's and tips to keep people.  If we don't start doing these common sense things, we don't stand a chance.  Thanks Bev and Sharon for a great update, just in the nick of time 
 I grew up watching martial arts movies and always wanted to see one that has more depth and meaning.  This movie does not follow the sterotypical path of most chinese martial arts films.  The actors communicate on many different levels that one would not expect.  I was very pleased and inspired by this movie.  This will be on the top of my favorites list for many decades 
 Design students, design educators and practicing designers should own this book. Design students will certainly gain a fundamental understanding of page structure. The author explains her system of design in a clear straightforward incremental manner. Grid Systems is a good book for design educators to use as a course book for an introduction to page structure. The text and images within the book can be used by faculty as a guide for a variety of projects-posters, book covers, multi-page systems, websites, etc. The professional and historical examples within the book also provide educators with a design history context. And finally practicing designers who are looking for a quick overview of grids will find helpful examples and explanations to break out of their grid rut. In fact, I showed this book to a colleague and her response was "this makes me want to rethink my grid systems." Grid Systems by Kimberly Elam is a must read for any designer and must have for any design library 
 An obligatory text for any visual, aural, or literary artist, and a necessity for any true understanding of the nature of artistic creation 
 This update is aces!  The added information on pregnancy/lactation safety came just in time (I had just started the L&D rotation).  The Quick Look-up feature is very helpful!  Overall, this Drug Guide is a MUST for nursing students and licensed nurses 
 I have read all three of Mr. Savage's recent books, Savage Nation, The Enemy Within, and now this one. These books enrage the self-styled "trendy" leftist mainstream, because they are based on fact. The so-called tolerant left have resorted to anti-Semitic remarks, for lack of any rational criticsm for Mr. Savage.  There was a time when I was younger, when I almost became a leftist. However, I am one of the few people who read and research both sides of an issue, where too many others simply rely on what they already think that they know. I attended meetings of leftist groups, I read their "literature", and all manner of publications. I was thoroughly indoctrinated by a typical public education before college, but in the course of researching the leftist ideology, I have found nothing but deception, distortion, distraction from the facts, and out-right emotionally hysterical hate-filled lies.  The bottom line is that the so-called "liberalism" of our time will not liberate you. The modern "liberalism" seeks to make you a serf to an all-encompassing socialist state. To attain that end, the first goal of the left is to destroy and disassemble our Western culture. Under the principle's of Western culture, we follow Voltaire's philosophy of "Although I hate what you say, I will fight to the death for your right to say it." Under a leftist "politically-correct" regime, you will find yourself in a concentration camp if you speak contrary to the leftist dogma. I am a military veteran of 15 years service, and a patriot 
 This is a fabulous product! I've had it for about a month and it's been working great so far! I haven't even had to clean the filter. I just use filtered or distilled water and it runs perfectly. I also found you can add water to the extra dish, don't even need to take the dome off. My cats were hesitant at first, but both of them drink off the dome and dish now. I got it because one of my cats has bladder stones and needed to be encouraged to drink more. Now she does! It's great! Highly recommended 
 All I have to say is great album 
 James Elkins (Professor of Art History and Theory at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago), presents On The Strange Place Of Religion In Contemporary Art, an in-depth exploration of the complex dilemma of the modern artist concerning to what extent his art should reflect his faith. Even as art historians separate art from spirituality, the long history of art has been intertwined since long, long before the Renaissance. On The Strange Place Of Religion In Contemporary Art explores the dichotomy through the stories of five individuals, and turns over key terms and ideas scholars express when analyzing religious themes and motifs found in the art world. Highly recommended reading especially for art critics and art history students, seeking to better understand both their knowledge base and their descriptive vocabulary of the great works they view. 
 The book arrived in a timely manner and was just as advertised.  I also really enjoyed reading it 
 The UltraLounge series definately covers the genre throughly, and this one is about the best in the series.  Not every song is well-known, but most are very very enjoyable.  This is a good place to start if you are introducing yourself to the genre. I thought Bobby Darin's More was the most lush and enjoyable of the tunes.  You'll get a chuckle out of Prima's Closer to the Bone, a song not found on the usual Prima samplers. You certainly get a "you are in old Vegas" feel off of these tunes! Check out their UltraLounge website for a good look at the full series. Definately recommended 
 Fantastic book!  Templeton uses the business parable style to truly delve into building relationships that become profitable.  A truly great piece of literature for the beginning entrepreneur.  Open this book and build more relationships to build your business 
 I had never read a book by Mariah Stewart and was amazed to find how hooked I was right from the start when I found "Brown-Eyed Girl"!  I have a group of authors whose books I try to make a point of reading, and she is definitely on my list now!  I love her style of writing - the blend of romance and suspense and a little bit of every-day wit and humor are just the right ingredients.  I also like the fact that there is not a great amount of sexual detail - just a great down-to-earth story, that has subtle romance which seems to be more effective and meaningful.  The characters of Leah and Ethan are so well-developed that you feel they are people you would like to have in your life, and it is hard to let go of them at the end of the book. I am now reading "Voices Carry", which is sort of a sequel, in that the main characters of this book were secondary characters in "Brown-Eyed Girl", and I am thoroughly enjoying that book also. It is not necessary to read them in order, as the stories do not tie in very much, but I would definitely recommend that you read them both, as they are each such engrossing stories!  In fact, I am so impressed with her style that I have ordered or bought all of her books to read, and am looking forward to many more "adventures"!  So glad I found her 
 There is nothing much left to say about Massive Attack's masterpiece of "trip-hop" that is Blue Lines.  Tricky's raps are classy and smart and the warm synth work is both inspiring and brilliant. The deep dub-like bass grooves on this album are legendary. "Unfinished Symphony" is a soulful pop masterpiece.  This album is displayed prominently on my CD rack.  Ok, I will stop the praise..only if you buy this album now 
 This is my second Mark Roeder novel. I too read "A Better Place" prior to reading "The Soccer Field...". I enjoyed both pieces, however, I found "The Soccer Field..." somewhat redundant. The author tells us every other page how much these two guys love each other (we get it already). Even though the writing is relatively mediocre I must say I love Roeder's work. I have purchased every title in "The Gay Chronicles" and look forward to reading them as well. As an adult, I identify with so many of the situations presented in his books. They are real and true, I can also say as a teacher I see many of these situations occur on school campuses everyday. The books are great reading for straight readers as well, especially adoloscents, who would benefit greatly from reading these stories. Keep up the good work Mark. I highly recommend everyone who is sensitive to the issues presented here, pick up a copy and see some real life situations that so many kids in our schools today are going through. What Mr. Roeder depicts is not far from the truth 
 I remember this book as one of my favorites.  As a child I would read it over and over.  Now that I have two sons, I have gone to the library several times to borrow it.  I recently asked the school library to acquire  it and was amazed when they received word that it was out of print.  Browsing through a book store this Christmas I stumbled upon a copy of it  and snatched it up quickly!  Now, I can read this wonderful story to my  children anytime they want, and can take it to their classrooms and read it  to their friends!  I'm delighted to be an owner of this book 
 I am of two minds about this book.  First, I hated to come to the end, as with most Bryson books.  It's like traveling with someone who amuses you a great deal and whom you will miss when you part ways.  On the other hand, I was often clueless about where he was (no, I did not bother to consult a map).  Athough he provides a short glossary, there were many unfamiliar terms to this California guy.  There are certainly recuyrring themes, to say the least.  There might be room for an abridged version of this book for people outside the U.K.  But I would buy the unabridged version because I would not want to miss a great turn of phrase, even at the cost of listening to more whining about bad hotels.  And what's with the binge drinking?  Why didn't his wife accompany him to ANY of the cities?  I propose that she write "What I do while Bill is gone on his trips. 
 My parents read this book to me when I was young and when I was around three, I could reicte the whole thing from memory and then claimed that I could read it.  It gave me the confidnce to really learn to read.  It is an  amazing book that every child should read.  I'm seventeen now and it's  still my favorite 
 They don't make films like this today.  It's a scathing, smart, funny, and thought-provoking look at TV news.  But more importantly, it's a great film about complicated people and their relationships 
 THIS IS A KEYCHAIN VERSION.  THINK SHORT PITHY "DAILY AFFIRMATIONS"  LIKE, "REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T KISS ALL THE GIRLS." NOT A VERSION OF THE PAPERBACK--SUITABLE FOR DOLL HOUSES, MINNIATURE COLLECTIONS AND JOKES ABOUT THE HERD MENTALITY OF RETAIL INVESTORS VIA OBLIQUE REFFERENCES TO THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND GEORGE ORWELL'S "1984"  IF YOU GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL (OR PERHAPS COMMUNITY COLLEGE)YOU CAN BUY THS ONE IN ADDITION TO THE PAPERBACK AND THEN, ALL ON CUE, OR IN QUICK SUCCESSION, ATART READING THE "CHAPTERS"  SIZE AND SHAPE NOT CONDCIVE TO HITTING A SPECIFIC TARGET.  SMACKS WALLS AND BLACKBOARDS EFFECTIVELY WHEN THROWN OVERHAND 
 This book has everything you will need to know if you are worried about toxins. 
 If your Kodak camera can fit one of these, and you have a wireless network -- or are near them when you take images -- get this card. I use it MUCH more often than I thought I would, and it's great to be able to send images to friends and family just after taking them 
 This stuff is incredible! Melt in you mouth pure chocolate, hand made by lepricons in Cadbury, Ireland, using only the finest ingrediants. Thoes firey little green men put Nestly and Hershy to SHAME!! 
 Flawless movie making at its best! Patriotic and powerful telling of the true beginning-of-the-end for the Confederacy. Ex-slaves and free blacks alike, finally allowed to defend their dignity, were the final blow to the Southern bondage of an entire race of human beings history tells us. The Truth based story of the Massachusetts 54th. Only the beginning of black heroics during the Civil War.   From the dignified talent of Morgan Freeman, to Denzel Washington's Academy Award winning performance as a militant loud mouth runaway, great acting to suit everything else about this film. And another level of respect achieved for Matthew Broderick indeed. So many standout scenes, but most memorable, Denzel's beating. Back already scarred from his cruelly treated past, he takes his punishment in total silence. Only allowing a single tear to fall during a cinematic closeup. Heartbreaking.  The highest rating possible. 
 As a teen, Leigh was a rebel protesting the Viet Nam War so her parents decided she needed a change of scenery sending her to her uncle an aunt's home in Wisconsin where she met studmuffin Charlie Payne.  Leigh chased after the shy man who was intimidated by his mother until she finally caught him.  They made love in an abandoned house, but as Charlie was leaving he fell through the floor, hit his dead, and died.  His mother claimed Leigh killed her son, but the police ruled it an accidental death.  She returned home pregnant.  Eighteen years later Leigh's daughter Deana is on a date with Allan when a man carrying a cleaver and wearing a chef's hat chases after them and kills the lad.  The culprit is the former chef at Leigh's restaurant, who was recently fired.  Macer, the detective in charge, becomes romantically involved with Leigh.  When the police catch Allan's killer, Leigh feels safe, but she soon will learns she is wrong because someone is coming for her and her daughter.  Richard Laymon is a Bram Stroker award winning horror novelist who proves he can switch genre gears by writing a fantastic thriller as well.  From the very beginning, the action explodes and just accelerates beyond warp speed and yet allows for a strong believable relationship between mother and daughter even when stress threatens to destroy it as both want to protect the other.  The story line is loaded with surprises so that the audience never knows what will happen next. This totally absorbing crime thriller will have readers enthralled and unable to put it down until the last page is turned.   Harriet Klausner 
 Despite the fact that my musical taste now ranges from Tim McGraw to OTEP I really grew up on the R&B and Hip Hop of the 90's.  Everything from SWV to TLC, Boyz II Men and Jodeci.  Matter of fact, my favorite album of my childhood would have to be `Crazy/Sexy/Cool' by TLC.  This album is really their definitive moment, capitalizing on T-Boz's sultry voice, Chilli's sex appeal and Left-Eye's (RIP) spunk and energy and delivering their most memorable and inspiring hits from the controversial `Waterfalls' to the guilty pleasure of `Creep'.   Songs like `Red Light Special' and `Diggin on You' really set the mood right, T-Boz almost verbally stimulating us and getting us ready for anything.  Just thinking about this album makes me...um...so let's move on.  Another great mood setter is `Take Our Time' and the sultry `Lets do it Again'.  Not a huge fan of `Case of the Fake People' but that's just a minor low-point and they far then make up for it with songs like their classic cover of `If I was your Girlfriend' which they blow out of the water, and the great closer `Sumthin Wicked This Way Comes'.  All I can say is that `Creep' has to be the greatest TLC song, or possibly the greatest R&B track from the 90's period!  As far as the intros and interludes and skits are concerned, they just add weight to this album and give us a nice detour from this brilliant and wonderful musical experience.  I just don't know if it can get any better than `Crazy/Sexy/Cool'.. 
 This series just gets to be more and more fun.  I love Holly Winter and her two beautiful Alaskan Malamutes.  This book delves into the world of working dogs, more specifically hearing aid dogs.  Dogs are wonderful aids for people with all kinds of disabilities.  Ruffly is an adorable little mixed breed that lives with a woman who is hearing impaired, and believe me, he takes his job seriously.  And we also have a murder to deal with.  A murder that it seems only Holly thinks is a murder.  The denouement of the murderer is also fun because we have Holly backed by her trusty Rowdy who do the unmasking.  This series is definitely for dog lovers, but even those who aren't as fascinated by dogs as some of us will enjoy this warm and wonderful series 
 Mallrats is by far and away Kevin Smith's best and funniest movie.  Jason Lee steals this movie as the loud mouthed, comic book collecting Brodie.  The fact that this movie survived and was even enhanced by mediocre actors such as Jeremy London, Claire Forlani, and Joey Lauren Adams says a lot about the script and Smith casting these people in the perfect role.    TS (London) and Brodie get dumped by there girls on the same morning and decide to heal at the mall.  Brodie's antics and his almost fight outside the comic book store are pure gold.  They both end up on Brandi's (Forlani) dad's game show that's being broadcast from the mall.  Comedy ensues.   If you watch only one Kevin Smith movie, watch this one (actually, this is the only one really worth watching and it's all encompassingly worth it) 
 clearly not as well-written as some of the earlier seasons 1 & 2, there is some creative episodes which add to the Superman mythos - particularly relating to his Kryptonian history.  a must-have for fans of Lois & Clark and Superman alike, others can probably pass this one up and not miss out on anything 
 He's been doin' this since writer's block part 1, and it's still good. Cop this, it's a good album.. 
 Well, I got this box set as a gift from my brother, I find it really nice and interesting, it is great for a fan to know Rod Stewart still is important in music charts, I enjoy this albums eventhough many of the tracks are really new to me because being peruvian I have not listened to any song before but keep on thinking they are wonderful. Finally I wait for more rod stewart success on charts. Jamel Cavero Gambo 
 It's hard to like Hugh Farnharm. He drives his wife to alcoholism, turns his son into a mortal enemy, and impregnates the only woman available to that son in the apocolyptic future. He conveniently gets rid of his old family to start a new one with a much younger woman. His son Duke, however, is a good and moral man, despite often being wrong, but he's wishywashy. It's clear that Duke gets shafted, but it's only because he fails to act. There is a time when Hugh tells Duke that his best option might be to shoot Hugh in the back. It's too bad Duke didn't do it. Hugh Farnham deserved it 
 Ridley Scott's ground breaking movie Blade Runner has been widely acclaimed by innumerable sources as the best science fiction movie ever made. While that position can be argued on many different levels, nobody can deny that the movie has an unmistakable ambience; one that is both believable and that has a depth few movies of any genre manage to attain. A key element in creating this depth is the stunning soundtrack written and performed by the incomparable Vangelis.   On one level, Vangelis has written music that works perfectly with the themes of the movie and helps to propel the story line. The music is beautiful, poignant, exciting and mysterious. Each passage fits so well within the context of the movie.    On a grander scale, he managed to dissect the society in which this story takes place to create a musical backdrop that is rich with multi-cultural references and styles. With his music, Vangelis has filled in the cracks of this world, providing us with a mélange of aural textures and nuances that make this imaginary place seem real in every way. Just as you cannot walk down the street of any city without hearing a variety of songs, noises, languages and dialects, so too does this soundtrack provide a mixture of seemingly random, yet unified passages that make this world complete. Scott and Vangelis could have easily ignored these extra layers of detail and have told the story just as well, but by including the detail, they made a masterpiece.   This is my favorite soundtrack and among my favorite CD's of all time. I highly recommend it to anybody even remotely interested in the work of Vangelis or the movie.  Now here is the real challenge for collectors - Thanks to my very good friend Chris (Thank you, a hundred times thank you!) I'm privileged to own a very rare copy of the Esper Production double CD package that includes a much more comprehensive collection of the music from this movie. If you ever see or have the opportunity to purchase this extended version, complete with much more dialog, sound effects and incidental passages than the official "sanctioned" soundtrack, snatch it up at any price. You won't be sorry. In the meantime, do as I did for years and enjoy this delightful soundtrack 
 I love "B"-HorrorMovies and this one fits every detail of a "good" (i use the term good loosely) B-movie. It has humor (I cracked up when i saw the head was still attached to the axe), it has gore (the aforementioned head-on-an-axe), and nudity (Tiffany Shepis is my future ex-wife). The movie was all around entertaining and that's what i watch movies for. If you're looking for some type of mental stimulation (which isn't a BAD thing) this ain't ya movie, but if ya lookin for some cheesy fun...The Hazing definitely fits the bill... 4/ 
 The book is what it says it is: A Gentle Introduction. If you want to know what Nanotechnology is before, for example, taking a course on it, this book will do the job.   The authors state (on page 4) that they "hope this book will be a quick airplane or poolside read...". It will take somewhat more effort than that to grasp and retain what is written but it is still well within the compass of the "intelligent layman".  From a stylistic point of view I found the book a little tedious hence four stars out of five.   I also read "Understanding Nanotechnology" which covers much the same ground and which I prefered mainly on stylistic grounds 
 I found this book really enjoyable.  I don't know much about weddings, the first one I'll be in is my own, so I wanted to get an idea about the bridesmaid thing.  I thought that it does a pretty good job of explaining what the modern bridesmaid does.  It was very well laid out, and easy to read (takes an hour and a half if you can sit down and go through it at once).  I've already given it to one of my bridesmaids, and will be getting a copy for my other one very soon 
 AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I AM HOPING TO HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS EDDIE, THE MAIN CHARACTER, DID. IF THIS IS LIFE AFTER DEATH THEN LORD I AM OKAY WITH DEATH.  WHAT A GREAT STORY THIS WAS. SO HEARTWARMING AND A BOOK I COULDN'T PUT DOWN. IT WAS AS COMFORTING AS IT WAS EXCITING.  I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET TO EACH OF THE FIVE PEOPLE HE MET IN HEAVEN. THIS BOOK WAS A VERY EASY READ AND IT IS DEFFINATELY ONE OF MY FAVORITES 
 Sometimes short stories bug me, but since it is Stephan King I decided to try it out. I also tried it out because the short stories. Most of them are about ten pages. 	 	In this collection of stories King keeps you in suspense because you don't know if the main character is going to live or no. That is the fun of King. The BEST Sometimes They Come Back- This is the most terrifying because the main character becomes helpless and thinks he can't do anything about it. It's also a tragedy, its horribly sad, but its one of the best stories in here. Trucks- Great! Trucks come alive and start killing people. A group of survivors are trapped inside a truck stop with trucks waiting for them outside. This is the point in the book where the stories start getting really good. Strawberry Spring- A truly creepy story of a serial killer stalking a college campus, the twist ending is predicable, but the story is so well written and it is a good story at that. I will never think of fog the same way again. Children of the Corn- Everyone's heard the story about religious kids who sacrifice adults to "he who walks behind the rows". To bad that married couple had to stop there. It's a great scary story with a great ending. I loved it! The Ledge- A man has an affair with a married woman whose husband is a mob boss who lives on the 43rd story, bad choice, but makes for a great story. This one will have you on the edge your seat. The Lawnmower Man- Some may find this to bizarre for there tastes. Because it's bizarre and it really doesn't give any explanation, but I loved it, a man hires this company to mow his grass, soon does he find out that something is very wrong with the guy who came to mow it, Very.  Quitters Inc. - A truly great idea for a story. If he smokes the first time (after signing a contract with Quitters Inc to stop) they kidnap his wife and... that's for you to find out. The ending is really unsettling. The Man Who Loved Flowers- The less you know about this story the better. Trust me its really good. The GOOD I Know What You Need- A good story, its like a love story with a creepy Stephen King twist. A woman falls in love with a man who knows somehow everything that she needs. One for the Road- Similar to Grey Matter, but way better because it actually goes where the story should it doesn't just end. Truly creepy and a great ending! Boogeyman- A sad scary tragic story who has been victimized by the boogeyman a number of times, a good story with a twist at the end that makes it even better. The Woman in the Room- A story that has no suspense or horror, it's just a sad story about a man who is trying to decide to whether to euthanize his mother  who is dying slowly and painfully. The Last Rung on the Ladder- Again it isn't suspense or horror, but it's a really good story about a special relationship between a brother and his sister. I am the Doorway- While I thought the story was way too short this just has such a great idea. A man wakes up with eyes allover his hands that make commit murder. The DISAPOINTING Graveyard Shift- Had a promising start, but the ending was totally random and it didn't feel very complete. Night Surf- I was looking forward to this story, but it flickered then died. It gave us a glimpse of a good story then it ended. The Mangler- I liked the idea, but the ending was way too ambiguous for me. Grey Matter- Sets up a great story then ends just as it was getting good. Again a little to ambiguous for me. Battleground- It's a hard story to put to page; I saw it made it into a TV episode in the Nightmares and Dreamscapes TV series before and it was better way better than this.  	This is a great book of short stories. Even the disappointing ones are worth reading. A great collection. 
 This is by far my favorite Scarpetta book.  Cornwell does an excellant job of pulling the reader into what each of the main characters are feeling in the aftermath of the death of Benton Wesley.  Opening with the letter was brilliant.  I read this book in 3 days, I was on the edge of my seat and thought it was a really smart read.    While other people have not favored the ending, I did like it, because it leaves the door wide open for a comeback 
 It is a tragedy that Brandon Lee died while making this film.  Had he lived, the Crow sequels would have been much better.  The Crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace.  It set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990's.  
 Sally Field And James Garner star in this May-December romantic comedy. It's one of the funniest movies of all time, and has James Garner at his finest. He definitely makes the movie. Murphy's a widower, doesn't figure he can find another woman to love. Emma has been married to a good-time boy who was never there for her, or her son, unless he needed something. I love the age play in this movie. Emma's son (played by a young Corey Haim) gets a ride in Murphy's car and things he's driving too flow, then they pick up a man that is even older than Murphy and he wants out because he's driving too fast. The movie is full of those kinds of moments that just make you smile because it's funny that it is so true 
 his film is completely different from what I thought it was going to be:  a sensitive nature outing about a man who researched grizzly bears and advocated for them, only to be tragically killed by them.  Alas!  After reviewing the case, I must conclude the bloke was duly consumed.  Yes, folks, this is a movie about one of the stupidest mortals to ever walk the earth in recent years.  Regardless of how you feel about Timothy Treadwell, you'll be completely dumbstruck -- enthralled -- by this movie, masterfully wrought by Werner Herzog.  Perhaps you'd like to know:  the audio file of Timothy and Amy being eaten appears nowhere in the film, after the credits, or anywhere on this DVD in the special features.  The woman who possesses this tape (and you'll see her in the movie) hasn't released it to the public.  I mention this because many people, I think, might buy the DVD thinking it's going to be on there somewhere.  No, the special features are crud:  no director's commentary, and a 50-minute documentary on the recording of the film's music, which is pretty much snoresville.  There are no other special features whatsoever.  And I love how Amazon makes it look like Amie Huguenard is "starring" in  it.  Sheesh 
 Angela Lansbury and George Hearn give superb perfomances - supported by an efficient cast. If you like morbid humor, you will greatly enjoy it 
 This book brings together the stories of seemingly unrelated people who all perish on a bridge collapse. The book is philosophical, but not in a heavy handed way. The writing is eloquent and the story is memorable. I read this for a book club and we all had much to say about whether or not we liked it and what the deeper meaning is behind the story. This is a thought provoking book from a skilled writer. 
 What a great album - subtle and mesmerising.  This trio works really because of the guitar player more than anything else.  And a welcome return to something both ethereal and earthy in large measures.  This album mixes acoustic warmth with a good, solid, electric trio sound 
 It only took me a day and a half to read it.  The comparison to Michener was an understatement.  He did a terrific job.  I will be looking forward to his next book.  Morley is a genius 
 Excellent story, well written and totally entertaining. Many, many twists and turns.   A young girl is found murdered and all evidence  and suspicion points to her former boyfriend with a criminal past.  Cork is not convinced that he is the murderer and delves deep into the investigation uncovering lots of hidden secrets and hidden identities.  WIll keep you guessing from first page to last. A must read. Next to Boundary Waters, Krueger's best yet! 
 A change from traditional artwork make this book shine, you fall in love with the beauty of it in moments.  The story is fantastic, and completely capable of actually happening.  This story is a great "what if?" book, and a must have of any comic fan. 
 I found the book very useful for any budding entrepeneur. One can learn a lot from mistakes from Mr. Winn . Also one gets good insight into how these top company execs think and operate ( i.e not as well as you would imagine! ) I have the audiobook and the narration by Kuo is excellent, very real and humorous 
 If you already own an older copy of "Nowhere", then sell it and buy this one.  The sonic quality is noticeably better, and if you don't own the original "Today Forever" ep, then the four extra tracks here are worth the price alone.  The album itself is full of incredible classic ride tracks.  "Vapour Trail", "In A Different Place", and "Paralysed" are my favorites, but every track here is great.  Its quite a shame that Andy Bell could write these sorts of songs and then now be satisfied to be the bass player in a sub-par band (Oasis)who's only claim to greatness was (and "was" is a key word here) a clever knack for ripping off great songs of the past 
 Versatile master recipes, well written, meticulously researched -- all the things that you would expect of a Julia Child cookbook. As several reviewers have said, if you only buy one cookbook, make it this one. It teaches a wide variety of techniques through recipes that can carry you through a lifetime. I've had a copy of this book for almost 20 years and I refer to it constantly. I'm on my second copy; my first was signed by the late author, so I put that splattered copy away for posterity. I have given this to all of my girlfiends when they've gotten married; invariably, it ends up being the book the they use most, too. I own about 400 cookbooks, but this is one of few that stays out on my kitchen counter bookshelf. 
 Anyone complaining about this album needs to listen to it again and again. As far as flow of the album, its simply wonderful listening straight through. There isn't a song on there I would skip. The wordplay and lyrics are some of his best and some of the best I have heard all year. Next to The Roots - Game Theory -  this album outshines everything else. The lyrical content is current well put and the production is really original. Mos even reps GZA's Liquid Swords, which is arguably the best, or at least most lyrical hip-hop album in history, and Mos does it quite well. His flow just grabs you and the content speaks to anyone. "Dollar Day" jumped out at me as an instant classic. As far as the new albums out that speak about Hurricane Katrina, this song outshines them all, Mos simply kills it. Listening to the album, it seems that each song works well with the others. Nothing is overdone, and he covers an incredibly wide spectrum of issues that are all important. The album is simply wonderful to listen to, and if you have doubts, put it on repeat. 
 I saw this movie once when i was in elementary school. I am now 26 years old and this movie has always been in my head. While i don't remember the details the the story stuck with me. I would highly recommend this for anybody with children. I just recently was able to track down the name of this movie as the only details i could recall was he kid living in the hollowed out tree and his pet eagle , and i intend to purchase a copy for myself to bring back those charished old memories 
 Really when I think about it, I found Penny Dreadful to be a mediocre sequel to Kiss Me, Judas, but that could just be that Kiss Me, Judas was a like the experience with a new drug, one never gets that high you got the 1st time. I was probably just the absence of Jude and the missing descriptive torrid sex that came along with Jude, that failed to draw me in as much. That's not to say that I didn't think Penny Dreadful wasn't an excellent novel, full of surrealism and noir tendencies, fuzzy transitions and other worldly characters who prance about in a stress, drug and sub-conscious induced haze. Numb to the world around them and their plural indentities, in and out of the game.  Phineas Poe our intrepid hero once again has found himself in a dangerous situation in the dregs of society, caught up in a web of drugs, fuzzy logic and dangerous individuals Poe must see through the B.S. which is much easier for him this go around without the morphine addiction and the whole coming to grips with his only having the one kidney.  Poe as a character seemed much more together, and a lot less confused in the 2nd Poe novel, which I greatly liked, he is a very excellently developed figure and I like him better without quite so much fog. Thats not to say that he isn't confused and disoriented several times in this novel, its just a little less.  Check it out, see what you think. 
 This book is a fine work of (unintentional?) self parody. Some of you are probably already familiar with a quote from this book in which Kass condemns public ice cream consumption. Some are undoubtedly tempted to guess that this quote as an aberration, a whimsical flight of fancy in which the otherwise sober Kass lets his bizarre pet peeves override his otherwise serious philosophical investigation. Not so! The Hungry Soul consists of nothing but whimsical rants in which Kass makes no distinction between personal pet peeves and universal moral law.  In some sense, one must admire Kass. He makes his blatant contempt for reason clear, and then follows through with this attitude by abandoning it entirely. Kass does not follow in the footsteps of philosophers like Hume who use rationality to probe the limits and uncover the weaknesses and self-contradictions of rationality. He simply has no truck with reason in any manner.  Thus, when Kass exhorts his readers to purge themselves of scientific, enlightenment rationality when they read his book, warning them of what a difficult task that will be, or claims that cannibalism and vegetarianism are moral equivalents, or that the reason behind the biblical prohibition on eating lobster exists is because their mode of locomotion is improper to their environment (i.e., if they walk on legs, they should be land animals and if they live in the water, they should swim like fish), the most enjoyable thing is not to think of counterarguments, nor to reel at the sheer madness of the doctor's thought, but to simply let the wondrous illogic wash over you.  For first an foremost, Kass's thought is not philosophical, nor Biblical, nor conservative (though it has elements of all of these things), but magical. The laws of magic are pre-rational psychological rules-of-thumb, used in pattern recognition, that are found, to varying degrees, in many, if not all, people: the laws of contagion, association, similarity, sympathy, similarity, and the like. It is these magical laws that underpin Kass's thought. Accepted on its own terms, and properly understood, this is a quite enjoyable book.  Just don't look to it for moral guidance 
 Mr. Lal explores the historical and moral roots of Capitalism with an especially acute eye toward the role of globalization in helping to drive the expansion of wealth in modern liberal economies.  He is particularly careful about tracing the political and intellectual drivers behind open trading systems as well as the criticisms that developed in response.  Mr. Lal has a keen sense of irony and the unexpected. For example, he shows how the justifications for liberalizing trade in 19th Century England had far less to do with enhancing individual wealth or welfare and more to do with the government's hope that this would enhance its own revenues by giving it a bigger horse to ride.  The irony of the fact that globalization led to explosive improvements in personal wealth and welfare is not lost on Mr. Lal either.  He explores similar interesting and unexpected outcomes in the areas of labor law, trade protectionism, attempts to liberalize trade (e.g. WTO), and the global financial infrastructure.  As the book progresses, he attempts to deal with the entire panoply of criticisms of modern economic liberalism including discussions of poverty and income inequality, labor law and foreign labor, 'sustainable development' and anti-corporatism.  Mr. Lal is a proponent of trade liberalization as he sees in it the seeds of both national and individual economic growth.  He is, correspondingly, critical of the rise of reactionary anti-globalists and he marshalls copious evidence that such anti-globalist impulses undercut both wealth creation and international cooperation.  For example, few people realize the extent to which the early 20th century backlash against globalization (i.e. the anarchists) led to the first World War. The worry, of course, is that a similar backlash - a toxic brew of Islamic anti-liberal and Western anti-globalization forces - could lead to more conflict in the future (the latter not being a theme of the book but a concern touched upon in the last chapter).  In attempting to cover such a broad range of topics, the analysis is sometimes a bit fragmented or simplistic as "Dr. Steppy" observed.  But I disagree with the conclusion that this is endemic to the book at all - it simply isn't true.  Indeed, the example put forth by "Dr. Steppy" (the historical development of individualism) is such a tertiary point in the overall theme of the chapter on Morality and Capitalism that it would be a mistake for Mr. Lal to have developed it any further. My sense is that this critique has more to do with Dr. Steppy's political persuasion than with the merits of the work under consideration.  Dr. Lal's writing is straightforward and, while careful and somewhat academic in tone, very accessible to anyone with an interest in the topic and a modicum of intellectual ability.  I would recommend it along with Benjamin Friedman's somewhat more challenging work entitled "The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth. 
 The smells are as powerful as the emotions in this book written by a daughter of Presbyterian ministers and America's first female Nobel Laureate.One can almost get the smell of warm blood in the nostrils of Wang Lung , the main character, as he ruminates on the ill omen of the birth of his first daughter and third child or the 'slave' as girl children were known. Bestseller in 1931/32 it gives a glimpe of China on the verge of change. Buck's characters pulsate with life as they tell a Chinese, yet a universal tale of man's ever increasing estrangement from the land. The fortunes of peasant farmer Wang Lung ebb and flow alongside those of the inhabitants of the Great House of Hwang in the rural Anwhei province and later in the rich rural South. Human emotions leap out from the page as Wang Lung oscillates between destitution and self indulgence, while Olan , his wife remains servile in extremis. It offers a compelling close up of Chinese mores and culture through the broad lens of a western born, oriental raised author 
 Lush photographes of excellent quality.  Mr.Schenk writes with flair and wit and as though he is speaking directly to you, the reader. I can't get enough of this book.  I want to memorize all of it's info. So much in such a tiny book and with such personality.  {no dry science book of the 50's, 60's and 70's.}He gives you exactly what he said he would in his preface. Great read and lovely to look at 
 Extremely rare.A beautiful tone,nobody will ever have this evergreen voice again.Just listen to each passage and sound.A determinated voice,always under control even when she shouted.It's not me,anyway,who has to say this n' that.   She communicated her love and passions thru' the music.You can feel it.She is the MUSIC.She had brought the lyric's opera singers into a modern era. This album is great though.I listened to the arias over and over again.Just listen to your heart and to Callas.  
 This movie has it all.  The best role Jeanette McDonald ever played, and outstanding performances by Clark Gable as Blackie Norton and Spencer Tracy as Father Tim.  The special effects are amazing given there is no digital enhancement.  This is a must have for all movie fans 
 I sat down, opened this book and did not put it down until I was finished.  Even then, I re-read three chapters.  This book is a neccessary read for those of us without children, struggling to find our purpose in the world 
 Excellent book that provides exactly what I needed to learn to use Painter and the tablet 
 I have long appreciated the first edition of this excellent book. Apparently the second edition expands the feminist section (although the feminist section of the bibliography remains similar to the first edition) and includes consideration of post-modernism, which the bright and engaging author considers at greater length, at arm's length, in a separate book. The second edition also includes a new preface, which I admit I have not read. I am still grateful to and involved with and faithful to the first edition.  The author fully and carefully presents very difficult material in a comprehensible and engaging manner, logically, and structured for learning. In short, this is actually an academic expert on literary criticism who can not only write well but can teach, and how rare a beast is that! Terry also supplies us with very valid reasons in his conclusion for caring deeply about the ability to read a text critically. Basically, we thus can perceive truth from propaganda and unreliable sources. We can know when our own government lies to us, and who has an ax to grind or a bill of goods to sell.  This book therefore should be as necessary and required a study for any and every reader as are warnings on a pack of cigarettes. By this book we gain the power to understand and to judge what we read; we learn to read critically and contextually, and to learn that not all which is printed is true. And by this book alone I have finally come to begin to perceive just what is meant by that frequently used and never explained term semiotics. That alone is worth the price of admission. No fooling around!  Seriously, this scholar with great talent and commitment opens the world of literacy to us in a comprehensible manner, without leaving anything out. The subtitle of course remains: An Introduction. This introductory book hopefully serves as a portal for you to explore the many other writings and editings of this excellent teacher, thinker and writer. Learn to read, critically, and become stronger and wiser and free 
 I enjoyed Alex Maxwell and Christi Madaris' story.  Was it what I expected after waiting all this time to finally see those two get together.  NO! but Mrs. Jackson gave her readers what we wanted and that is Alex and Christi's love story.   There is really no such thing as a former FBI agent that can't find out inside things, and if he owns a security firm then he can carry a weapon overseas and anywhere else without a problem, I know this first hand.  Christi is a Madaris and stubborn as she can be, she wanted Alex that's why she left Texas.  But being stubborn didn't stop her deep love for Alex.  She may have started loving him with a little girls heart but she became a woman along the way, the women he wanted and needed to spend his life with.  It was because Alex loved Christi he would go to the end of the world to save her and he did.  The story has a lot of truth because there are sex slave rings that operate even in the U.S.  I think Mrs. Jackson does her research and pretty much gave us things in the story that are not what we hear everyday and most of us don't want to know.   This is not Mrs. Jackson's best book but it's far from the worst,and I've read it several times.  Mrs. Jackson has a lot of talent and it could be when we see hateful reviews about different books then maybe it's about vengence not honest opinion that are behind the words.  I hope Brenda Jackson will keep writing the kind of romance we love reading.  
 Ms Mitchell-Foust has given us a truely unique collection of poems with this book.  Wonders and freaks and people at odds with their surroundings being of particular interest to me - I find it truely wonderful that a poet as gifted and varied as Michelle has tackled this subject matter.  Often sympathetic but never sachirine these poems give us a rich and varied perspective on performers and oddities of all types.  The book itself is beautiful - the cover art and quotations adding texture to this already full plate 
 When I first checked this book out from the library I did something that I've never done with a cookbook before--I sat down and just read it. The author is so entertaining, witty, and engaging that I just liked reading the recipe descriptions, punk points, tips from Fizzle the cat, and litte vignettes that are woven into the book.  Then I started cooking. Oh, the scones! Amazing! The TLTs (tempeh, lettuce, tomato)! Wonderful! So many recipes, so little time.  So of course I returned the book to the library and bought my very own copy to drool over and treasure and love and sleep with under my pillow. OK, so I exaggerate, but not much.  The only downside is that many of the entrees call for tempeh, seitan, or tofu, and I don't use those products very often. But when I do, I know that Isa will give me a good recipe. But there are enough other recipes that I think it's balanced overall. And Isa convinced me to try roasted brussels sprouts on pizza. Crazy, I know, but it was SO GOOD.  Yesterday I also got Isa's newest book, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World. It's also wonderfully entertaining and I can't wait to start baking. I'm thinking of buying Vegan with a Vengeance and Vegan Cupcakes for all of my friends this Christmas--and none of them are vegan. No matter! Our vegan vengeance and cupcakey goodness will take over the world 
 With 317 prior reviews for this book, I'll keep this one short and sweet. I checked out the 5 hour abridged audio version of this book from the library on a whim not knowing quite what to expect. It was terrific. The Price of Loyalty provides insight into the inner workings and decision making process of the Bush administration through the recollections of former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. If you value thoughtful, considered decision making driven primarily by facts and process, you won't find the picture painted by O'Neill very pretty. O'Neill's first private meeting with President Bush is a real eye-opener. Suffice it to say, he didn't find an inquisitive, engaged and informed individual.  O'Neill recounts how he quickly ran headlong into the reality of a defacto inner and outer circle among the Bush administration senior officials and cabinet members. O'Neill was, by his own admission, in the outer circle. While there was the occasional exception, in many meetings the outcome was pre-ordained by the inner circle - discussion and debate was either discouraged or of no consequence. Some of these pre-decided decisions were real whoppers, most notably steering the topic of one of the first meetings O'Neill attended to the need to invade Iraq and topple Hussein. There were even maps of Iraq handy, complete with the location of current and potential future Iraqi oil fields. I kid you not - you can't make this stuff up because no one would believe you.  I don't know much about O'Neill, but he certainly comes across as a credible, principled person. In other words, his story rings true and, even though it's a couple years old, is well worth reading 
 This Sermon by Jesus is what the Christian aspires to be through the help of the Holy Spirit.  This book helped me to accept that I can have God's help and gifts, even now while still on earth, and take Jesus' teaching more to heart 
   As being a Generation X-er, I always heard stories of Babe Ruth being the best slugger and his 714 home runs. I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.    It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.   The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.    It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.   So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.  Mik 
 Our whole family loves this CD!  The music is fun and enjoyable for both adults and children alike.  It is simple enough for our young son, but complex enough to be enjoyable for us as well.  The book is fantastic, giving full French text and music for each of the songs, and then the English translation for all of them at the back of the book.  I highly recommend this product as an early exposure to French language, and simply as an enjoyable listening experience all around.    
 Since we received this as a gift for our anniversary 5-6? years ago, we have given it as part of our wedding gift to LITERALLY EVERY MARRYING COUPLE we've known EVER SINCE.   Our oldest of four daughters is 16 and she has begun reading it as a teaching tool for how to be a great mate and what to RIGHTFULLY expect from her mate as a Christian woman.  I STILL READ THIS EVERY DAY, and I give it to friends of mine, men and women alike with a note in the front that encourages them to remember that Christ is to be first, our spouses second, and our children third.  
 After reading Being Peace, I ordered additional copies for all my close friends. This book is both thought-provoking and accessible. Thich Nhat Hanh  has a way of presenting Buddhist lessons and ways of being, ways of living and thinking about ourselves and our relationships to others and the world in a style that is almost deceptively simple and deeply thoughtful. I highly recommend this book as either an introduction to Buddhist thought or as a way of enriching any life. 
 I received this as a shower gift and I love it!  I had a front carrier with my son 8 years ago, but it killed my back after 20  - 30 mins.  So, I had sworn off of them, but everyone swears by this thing these days.  When I was asked if I wanted one, I wasn't so sure but wanted to try it out.  Now, I have been using it for the past 3 mos. and my baby girl loves it.  We both have been really pleased.  She goes to sleep in this thing everytime I put her in it.  So, I guess it's comfortable to her too!  And, I have been shopping for groceries and have gone to the mall with this on and I know I was shopping for way longer than 30 mins. No back pain!!  It's fabulous!  I recommend it to any parent!! 
 If you enjoy AFHV you will be satisfied with this set.  The episodes are complete including the prize winners at the end.  The shows are presented in a simple no nonsense format on the DVDs.  Since viewers home tapes are featured in the shows the quality varies but is quite decent considering 
 I could listen to this every day.  Frank Mueller is a marvelous reader.  He adds a new dimension to this story 
 My girls love this book.  It's quick and cute and fun, and we read it with lots of enthusiasm during the day and with calm and quiet tones before bed.   The only drawback is the palm tree on the second page.  Because the girls like to lift the flaps (I have a 30 month old and an 11 month old), the palm tree flap tears off right away.  I keep reattaching it, but there's no way to secure it 
 Twenty five years ago I developed a taste for cooking.  Just out of the Marines, I picked up the Julia Child set after seeing and enjoying her show on PBS.  This set is a personal treasure and one that got me started on my collection of more than 100 cookbooks today 
 Wow... that is the only way to describe this ending.  With most cyber-punk films, you get a dreary conclusion that is steeped with philosophy with a sense of rebirth and renewal.  Usualy hope is reborn in one form or another, even if depressing sacrfices are necessary for it to happen.  That is not thew case here.  There is no great showdown or no great philosophy discussed with the future of humanity is at stake.  A boy has begun to change and desires to be different then what he was.  He wants to save a girl.  The ending seemed hectic and didn't fit the usual cyber-punk ending.  At first, I was shocked at what appeared to be mass violence and gorey deaths signaling a lack of a outline for the plot.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Watch these last two episodes, ponder on what you saw, then when you are ready, rewatch them.  You will be glad you did and you will see the reasoning behind what was once apparent anarchy.  The ending is not typical or happy or life affirming, but it is realistic for where the show was going and probably one of the best thought out endings I have seen in a while.  Certain people will hate this ending regardless of what I or anyone else sayts about it.  It is dark, depressing, disturbing, and quite sad.  Most of people who hate this would have probably been weeded out in earlier volumes.  To those that are left, brace yourselves and watch.  Give it a chance, you will be glad you did.  It is quite interesting to look back over the boy and how he has changed from the beginning.  Its a great series with a flawless ending.  A classic series, despite a slow beginninbg that lacked a detailed plot and a middle that tended ignor reality during the boy's fight scenes despite a stronger sense of reality everywhere else. 
 I always loved the Fox and the Hound as a child, so having it on DVD is so much fun!  This tale of a forbidden friendship appeals to both children and adults, even 25 years after its debut.  I highly recommend this movie as a Family-Friendly tale 
 This is a superb baseball book, but it's also a moving treatise on family, life and loss.  Author Roger Kahn grew up with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and covered that legendary team in the early 1950's as a young reporter for the old New York Herald Tribune.  Kahn lets us get to know the team's outstanding figures, from gruff skipper Charlie Dressen, to baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to stars like Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Carl Erskine, etc.  Readers should enjoy the author's sentimental look at Brooklyn prior to urban decline and the Dodger's inexcusable desertion to Los Angeles.  Kahn also grants a strong role in the narrative to his baseball-loving father.  Readers will learn (or be reminded of) baseball in a drug-free era of modest player salaries and loveable ballparks like Ebbets Field.  In the books second half the author interviews the former Dodger players twenty years later.  Hardship and tragedy followed several players into their middle age, yet most retained their gentle humanity long after they'd been returned them to the ranks of ordinary men.     THE BOYS OF SUMMER was published in 1972, yet remains one of the best baseball books ever written.  Readers should also enjoy its later companion, MEMORIES OF SUMMER.     
 Another great one from Terry Goodkind.  Couldn't put it down (school?  what's that?), and ended up finishing it in a few days 
 Not a bad book...  Not the best, though.  The Lomaxes put together a very  complete and exhaustive volume of folk music, that's for sure.  However,  some of it manages to contradict their other books, or has some songs more  or less complete than they are in those works.  Some of their choices of  songs as "folk music" are a little odd, too;  "Beautiful" would be a good example of this.  I would suggest  Folk Song USA as a better reference, if you can find it 
 On the surface, Candyfreak is about one man's journey to write about, well, candy. However, it only takes you a couple of pages to realize the book is much more. It's about one man's childhood and psychology. It's about reconnecting with things that are important to you. And yes, it is about candy. I told my friend that reading this book is a cross between reading a psychology case study and watching Unwrapped on the Food Network I am sore pressed to come up with a better description than that.   Almond is gracious enough to take us along on his quest to reconnect to the small candy makers that are often overlooked by the mass markets. He touches on the nostalgic sweets we remember from our childhoods, and often find hard to get anymore. However, he helps us in an ingenious way. Just when he's describing biting into some heavenly candy bar and you think you're going to go insane with hunger, turn to the back of the book because he provides websites so you can get your hard to find sweets online. I tried the links and they all worked at the time of this review.  This book changes the way you look at candy, to me in a positive way. It also launched me on my own micro quest to reconnect with some of the sweets I remembered from my childhood.   Over all, this book is TOO much fun and I highly recommend it.  
 I'm a med student and used this book for my gross anatomy lab and it was quite helpful.  I did have to reference Netter's Atlas along with this to get a deeper understanding of the subject matter.  However, I do recommend Grant's Dissector book because without it, I found that I was totally lost in my dissection lab.  This book showed me more instruction on how to dissect then just listening to my lab instructor.  For my gross anatomy exams , I also used the following which is on amazon: Spinal Anatomy Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick Leonardi.  This study guide helped me to prepare for the type of questions that were asked on the test.  My friends told me about this book from another med school.  In conclusion, I recommend the following for gross anatomy class: Grant's Dissector, Netter's Atlas, and Spinal Anatomy Study Guide:Key Review Questions and Answer 
 This is the ONLY version that really gets you in touch with the human quality of Tarzan and his torture.  Christopher Lambert does an exceptionally good job in this remake. The parallel of a man raised in the wild who could adopt the manners of society but was not happy there versus the aristocracy he was born into as being the true animals was touching.  Loved it 
 Now have the Complete Set for my Granddaughter!  Very Pleased 
 I've never written a review before and to be honest I didnt read the reviews on this item before I bought it. But I also hurt myself at work and the back pain was getting worse especially going into my third trimester. This back support made a big difference for me, it does work and I would recomend it. I only gave it 4 stars cause it does roll down a little on the sides of the back. Other than that its great and does its job 
 THE AUTHOR IS QUITE TALENTED. WEAVES A SUPREME BLEND OF STORYTELLING AND INTRICATE WEB OF UNDERSTANDING. PAINTS THE PERIOD QUIET WELL. HE DESERVED THE BOOKER FOR HIS WRITINGS. HE IS STILL UNDERAPPRECIATED AND IS RELATIIVELY UNKNOWN. I RECOMMEND HIS NEXT NOVEL : A FINE BALANCE, WHICH IS WRITTEN ON AN EPIC SCALE AND DWARFS THE LENGTH AND BREADH OF THIS BOOK. ROHINTON MISTRY IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND SHOULD BE GIVEN HIS DUE 
 I was thoroughly engaged by this moderately long book and its comprehensive historical detail. In the end, I became utterly sympathetic with the sad fate of Queen Marie Antoinette, political chattel and scapegoat, who, for those various individuals and groups who controlled her fate, represented very little that was human, and always seemed to be some broker's means to a power-seeking end.  Fraser's writing lays out the story of Marie Antoinette's life with objectivity, and builds a subtle position that is supported by the information she includes in this volume. Archduchess of Austria Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen, 15th child of Maria Teresa, Queen of Hungary and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire (by her marriage to Emperor Francis Stephen), was destined by her mother's strong will to be married to European royalty as an effort to shore up Austria's political interests in Europe (which was, of course, what royal children were for). Maria Antoine's childhood was one of some personal and emotional neglect, and she was married to the Dauphin of France, Louis Auguste (later Louis XVI), when she was 14. (This means she left her home, her native language, her siblings and all her own customs at that age, never to return and rarely to see a member of her own family again.)  Marie Antoinette became queen of France when she was 19. While her life was certainly luxurious and extravagant, she was not a leader or instigator of this culture -- she was merely assimilating with the culture of Versailles. She began her time in France under a somewhat positive light, though the French were always suspicious of her machinations in favor of Austria and the emperor (later Joseph, her brother, and then Leopold, her nephew). Her love of music brought her some influence and popularity, but the expectations from Austria that she would influence her husband in matters of policy were not often met. Louis XVI chose advisers consistently who were anti-Austria. Politics were never her forte, anyway, as her education had been somewhat neglected as a child. She was, however, kind and charitable, still living extravagantly to symbolize the wealth and prestige of the French royal household. Her inability to influence the political playing field brought her criticism from home as long as her mother lived, but her suspected wielding of her influence brought her endless criticism and personal attacks in France.  Her lifestyle included almost no privacy, as she was awakened by a full bedchamber of aristocrats and royals eager to press their access to help her dress, etc. She developed close friendships with several courtiers to replace the closeness with her sisters that she had lost. The most upsetting aspect of her public existence was the public knowledge that her marriage was unconsummated for as long as seven years, at which point, Marie Antoinette did conceive a child, a daughter, Marie Therese, the Madame Royale (who was born publically in the royal bedchamber in front of hundreds of courtiers). For her other children, there were health difficulties: the first dauphin, Louis Joseph, died of consumption, her fourth child, Sophie, died shortly after birth, and her third child, the second dauphin, Louis Charles, died during captivity in Paris of what also was likely consumption. Problems with her reproductive organs plagued Marie Antoinette, and Fraser speculates that she had cancer when she was beheaded.  The extravagance of Marie Antoinette's life lessened as she grew older, as she was a doting and attentive mother to her children and took great care with their education and upbringing. She also seemed to build a loving and close relationship with Louis XVI. She was at the forefront of a trend to simplify and live less luxuriously. Fraser successfully rebuts the myth that Marie Antoinette stated, "Let them eat cake" about the French peasants during a bread crisis, as that would have been counter to what is known of her charitable and philanthropic nature.  But as her extravagant lifestyle lessened with her maturity and the trends of the day, her fortunes were bottoming out in the public eye. The Affair of the Necklace (which gets complete treatment here) harmed her, and the endless criticism of Marie Antoinette in the tabloid press, some of it literally pornographic, kept a solid tide of negativity rolling her way. Coupled with her husband's weak resolve and lack of leadership as a king, Marie Antoinette became doomed...  Another aspect of Marie Antoinette's story that I was completely ignorant of is the length of time that spanned the storming of the Bastille and her execution in Paris. I had in mind that there were mere days or months between them, but, in fact, it was about four years that included various stages of captivity, political surges and trials. This stage of the book is also comprehensive and draws a plaintive picture of Marie Antoinette again as political tool, this time for those who wanted to show their strength and anti-royalist beliefs. The portrait Fraser paints of Marie Antoinette during this time is as an increasingly strong, religious, and dedicated French woman, suffering as gracefully as possible for the sake of her family and her adopted country.  Marie Antoinette was not perfect -- and her weaknesses including what is likely a long affair with a Swedish aristocrate, Count Fersen -- but her life ended horrifically (she was already a widow for some months and separated from her two surviving children) while she maintained the regal composure she was always known for.  For exmaple, she apologized to her executioner at the gallows when she accidentally stepped on his foot when she stumbled to walk with her hands bound behind her. In fact, it is said that she greeted her death as an end to her torture. Her death, like her marriage, was brought to her for her symbolic exhistence, not the human life she lived.  Fraser's book is exceedingly well written, and I was sad when it was over, as I loved spending time with Marie Antoinette. In fact, during a chapter that recounted how she and the king, the dauphin and Madame Royale were trying to escape Paris and their imprisonment, I sincerely hoped they would escape! I found myself thinking about her a great deal, and missing her when I could not open the book and read about her life. This is to me the greatest testament to a well-written biography. Her life and plight, as presented by Fraser, were very real to me, and isn't that what we read biographies for?  I STRONGLY recommend this book 
 We've been listening to this one every night for 16months, and we still love it.  The music is beautiful, not cloying or sweet.  And maybe it's just because we don't understand the lyrics, but it doesnt' get tiresome or seem condescending like so much children's music does. Not every song is a winner - there's one that's slightly annoying -- but basically, this is music I'd listen to even if I didn't have twins. Plus, as soon as it goes on my kids start nodding off.  Maybe it's just a Pavlovian response, but hey, whatever works 
 Into "old school" horror? Then check out Mother's Day! In my opinion, a gem or a rarity! I give this one four stars. Why? I wanted to see "more blood/gore." Other than that, check it out 
 Norris offers an insight-full monastically minded view into Dakota life, not just North and South Dakota, but the fascinating cultural differences between east and west of the Missouri river that divides So. Dakota.  In what I consider a very telling paragraph (p129) she begins a dialogue on sacred space saying that those who ask what is sacred really are asking "What place is mine."  Dakota seems to emanate from Norris' own coming to grips with place and aims to help others do the same.  That love-hate relationship that many feel toward home is evident within.  For those who know rural life in the midwest "Dakota" is penetrating and beautiful on one hand and so frustrating it made me want to move on the other.  At times she portays a rural ghetto of resisting outside influence (p.62), exclusionary unity (p, 59) lower professional standards which she also claims to be part of the small town charm (p.55).  It is both bitter and sweet but not from judgment, rather from her claiming this land as her own...this is where she belongs...this is where she planted and rooted.  Kathleen Norris has helped me to return to my roots, not in South Dakota, but Iowa.  It has given me a new found appreciation of the land and culture which I was and still am planted in.  For those in the midwest much of her insights will transfer to other contexts.  And for those not from the midwest or small towns it will be an interesting read into how the other half live and will likely offer some fine opportunities to reflect on your location 
 This is a wonderful wrap and my baby loves it. It can be tricky to figure out the best fit, but comes with helpful instructions. I also like the nice big pocket in the front. My back hurts a bit, but I am still figuring out the best way to wear it. The important thing is that my baby is happy and secure in it.  
 I do enjoy coming across a new British mystery series, and by the looks of things I'm going to derive a lot of fun from reading the next two installments in the Sara Selkirk mystery series scheduled to be released later this year. Well plotted, intriguing and full of beautiful and lush descriptions of modern day Bath, "Funeral Music" was a treat to read from beginning to end.  Suffering from an emotional breakdown that has prevented her from performing for quite a while, world renowned cellist has retreated to her cottage in Bath where she marks time exercising and giving cello lessons to Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Poole. And while her friends have been worried, none of them have met with any success in persuading Sara to perform publicly again. However her good friend, James has had enough, and manages to bully her into performing with him at the Pump Room. Giving in with bad grace, little did Sara expect that this one act would catapult into the middle of a murder investigation when she discovers the body of the Director of Museums and Civic Leisure Resources dead in one of the baths. Because Andrew is in charge of the investigations, Sara finds herself privy to all sorts of information, and when people she likes and care about come under police scrutiny, Sara finds herself reluctantly playing detective. And although she feels strangely invigorated, Sara will have to pay great care that her investigations don't land her on the killer's hit list...  What made "Funeral Music" so much fun to read was not so much the mystery at hand (if you're an avid mystery buff, you can more or less figure out what's going on about half way through the book) as the characters involved. Morag Joss has peopled her novel with characters that are engaging, flawed and sympathetic. Wanting to know what would happen to most of the characters had me glued to the pages till the very end. Another plus factor, "Funeral Music" was that this was an extremely well written book - the language, and the manner in which the book was framed was brilliantly done. And let no one tell you differently, a well written book is almost a rarity these days. So am I looking forward to the next Sara Selkirk mystery novel? Goodness, yes. If nothing else it will be fascinating to see how the author handles the  relationship that's brewing between Sara and DCI Andrew Poole.    
 As a reader familiar with the basic concepts of psychoanalysis, but  who despaired in finding a text that explains the history and underpinings of Freud's theories, I found this book a godsend. Quite frankly, I need to have strong prose to bolster my interest and the author doesn't disappoint, beginning with a very literary conceit, the possibilities suggested by the meeting btw Freud and Rilke; his style consistently engages the reader and makes Freudian theory relevant by introducing it through the universal experiences of mourning and loss. He more than answers the question of Freud's continued importantance in the age of Wellbutrin and Prozac 
 I liked this book, the only disappointing part was that the ending came so soon, and seemed very unfinished. But if there was a sequel I would read it in a instant!as a former self injurer I did find this book alittle triggering, so I would suggest older teens read it because they are probably less vulnerable. overall I would recommend this book. 
 April Kyle, the young girl Spenser saved from a vicious prostitution ring only to move her up to a top-of-the-line prostitution ring, is back and once more needs to be saved.  Only this time she's a full-grown woman running an independent sex operation of her own.  When she shows up in Spenser's office, he doesn't at first recognize her.  Then, after he does, she talks about how thugs are menacing her operation, trying to cut in on her business.  Spenser takes up her defense and soon finds himself enmeshed against a local thug working for a high-rolling predator.  Robert B. Parker is the bestselling author of the Spenser, Jesse Stone, and Sunny Randall series as well as several independent works like WILDERNESS, LOVE & GLORY, and APPALOOSA.  A television show, SPENSER: FOR HIRE, was based on his novels, as well as several made-for-TV movies.  His Jesse Stone series has become a series of made-for-TV movies starring Tom Selleck.  Parker's writing, as always, is elegant and smooth, whipping by in a blur as a seasoned reader slips comfortably back into the familiar world the author's been writing about for the last 30 years.  April Kyle's story is a familiar one:  she's in trouble and Spenser has to ride to the rescue.  The violence and action develops well, and even the psychological profiling that Susan does fits the story in a satisfying manner.  Hawk is present, riding backup as he usually does, and even Teddy Sapp, Frank Belson, and Martin Quirk put in appearances.  I would have liked a little more history developed on April Kyle.  In particular, why she left her family in the first place back in CEREMONY.  That character development seemed to be missing in this book.  As always, Parker's fans have been waiting on this novel.  Knowing that it would be about April Kyle has made the wait even more intolerable.  But it's here now, and long-time readers will enjoy the excursion with Spenser.  I really suggest new readers pick up copies of CEREMONY and TAMING A SEA-HORSE before reading this one.  That way more emotional context will be present for them 
 I throughly enjoy reading the bible and especially since I purchased NIV'S WOMEN'S DEVOTIONAL. It is so Inspirational to read from this bible. It is so clear and understandable and it offers devotional readings to motivate the heart and soul. I recommend this book to all women. One Love 
 I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.    Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture.  
 Any fan of Terry Pratchett's work knows that his satirical tongue knows no boundaries, especially when it comes to lampooning other famous literary works.  "Eric" may be the most straightforward rip-off/homage since it is a reworking of "Faust" (with 'Faust' crossed off each page heading and 'Eric' written next to it).  As always, Pratchett's humor is in full force throughout this interesting ride through history, space, time, and Hell.  When Eric, a thirteen-year-old demonology hacker, tries to conjure a demon to grant him three wishes, he is surprised to find he has conjured the inept wizard Rincewind.  Rincewind is pleasantly surprised to find himself out of the Dungeon Dimensions where he has been trapped, but less happy to discover that he has the to power to carry out Eric's wishes.  What follows is the two of them snapping through time in Eric's effort to rule the world, meet the most beautiful woman on the Disc, and to live forever.  However, things are not always what they appear to be and one must word one's wishes quite carefully.  "Eric" is a very quickly paced book, and while Rincewind is a familiar character, the qualities and dilemmas that make him an annoying one are just about overlooked in this Disworld trip.  Rincewind is at a loss, as always, as he and Eric try to find their way back to Ankh-Morpork, alive.  "Faust" has never been quite so funny, but some of the magic has gone out of the story.  And while "Eric" has its fair share of demons, they are humorous rather than diabolical, which is something the plot could use a small shake of 
 I have both 1 and 2 and I'm happiest with the 2nd.  Loads of great ideas for projects to keep the grandkids entertained and informed 
 If you are using the Mounce textbook for Basic Greek, these cards are a must!  They are in the order of the chapters of the book, and they have all the information you need to learn the vocabulary easily and quickly.  I carry them around with me on a ring clasp, and they are great!  I highly recommend them 
 I got this album after hearing the newest album "Gimme Fiction".  This album is pretty good, but the production of this album is very different from their lastest album.  It has more of a raw indie feel as opposed to the slightly overproduced sound of "Gimme Fiction".  Personal favorite tracks:  Everything Hits At Once, The Fitted Shirt, and 1020 AM.  Any Spoon fan should definately own this album 
 What I thought would be a another B movie turned out to be a good action flick.  Good actors Annabella Sciorra, Michael Biehn and quite a few other good tv actors.  Worth the money and time to see it. Characters were developed and you knew who they were and what purpose they served.  Good plot, even kept the interest of my grandchildren.  Can't find too many directors or producers that can make an interesting plot and keep it moving.  Dr. Lily McKee played by Annabelle Sciorra discovers a massive asteriod hurtling towards the earth and tries to get Feds to help and believe her. She notifies FEMA in comes Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn) he plays his role well -- better than Annablle Sciorra, sometimes she looks like she is confused...but carries her role well.  Good flick I think you'll enjoy. Good special effects.  
 I loved this book.  It's the story of Eleanor and her relationship with food, her mother, her 2 sisters and an uncle who is about to die.  The characters all had such depth that I felt as if I truly knew them.  The writing had wonderful flow and I could not put it down.....I did not want this book to end.  
 I read the Amazon customer reviews on this wall mount, and decided to check it out. I am glad I did! I have a 32" WinBook LCD, and installation was a snap. The tv looks great, and I am really happy with the articulation. I installed it at night and kept waiting to hear a crash before morning, but this arm is extremely sturdy. It is also adjustable for leveling the display; this is good because even though it is perfectly level on the wall, apparently the plate that mounts to the display is not squared, but I was able to easily compensate. I recommend this to anyone who wants to be as cool as me 
 Science writing needs to avoid two obvious traps: the pedantic discourse for the supposed layman, or the oversimplified analogy bordering on the erroneous. Paul Nahin deserves full credit for circumventing these effectively in his book about optimization. He is clear about the background he assumes on his readers part, though he doesn't always provide adequate references for those who don't. He does, however, offer pertinent citations for those readers who wish to wade deeper. I only wish he was more careful with his equations, and even more so with his diagrams, which often confuse rather than clarify... but the good things first.   The choice of topics, their sequence and the examples signify not only their historical importance, but places several in a modern context, with an emphasis on numerical solutions. I especially liked the approach he takes in section 1.7 with the numerical-graphical technique. The muddy wheel in section 3.6 demonstrates how an interesting (and real!) problem can yield to analytical techniques. However, numerical methods can be stretched at times, which is evident in the justification of eliminating one of the two values for a minimal surface on page 268. One would have appreciated a physical explanation based on analytical techniques. of From a historical perspective, the use, discovery, exploration, development and the final definition of the derivative, (in that sequence!) and how Fermat played a seminal role in it clears several misconceptions even before the Newton-Leibniz imbroglio.   There are two particular examples that I would like to underline, both for their simplicity and their beauty of exposition. The first is the projectile problems in sections 5.4 and 5.5. They demonstrate a wonderful but simple extension to a topic typically explored in the classroom or in textbooks, but which has its roots in a very real problem- the strategy of the discus throw or basketball shot. The analysis of rainbows in section 5.8 is astounding. It is detailed to the extent necessary, and answers some very basic questions about a beautiful phenomenon. [...]  Where Nahin stumbles at times is maintaining that delicate balance between challenging his readers and fleshing out every mathematical step in its symbolic detail. While I am sure it has helped increase his readership from Hawking's half-lost-for-every-equation conjecture, it is often a waste of space, or worse still, displays a lack of economy and elegance. See, for example, the algebra on page 249. There is also a failure to mention the physical interpretation of beta as the angle for the parametric equation for the cycloid (page 217) which would make things simpler while proving the tautochronous property (page 222-227).   While I have commended the excellent treatment of rainbows in the context of derivatives, I must add that I find it appalling how inaccurate some diagrams in the book are, and in one case, even incorrect. The case in point being the figure 5.10 on page 184, "Illuminating a raindrop." While it is mentioned that it is rotated relative to figure 5.9, the arrows on 5.10 completely misrepresent its purpose. There should be no arrows along the line that makes an angle to the center. This is just a reference normal line. There should be arrows on the horizontal line above the one that passes through the center, and this should be extended to a line with arrows and subtending  the correct refracted angle with the normal line.   How important is scale? Is it important to represent geometrical figures to scale when possible? Is it detrimental to the perception or solution of the problem if little attention is given to scale? If you have answered any of the questions in the affirmative, look at figure 3.5 on page 81 and figure 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 on pages 281-283, but especially figure 7.2. I shall not waste my words here, but it really saddens me to see that geometrical figures that lends itself to a very satisfying visual treatment has so little attention paid to accuracy and scale. With that, I rest my case 
 This is the best book I found on SNMP.  I found Essential SNMP to be lacking in detail and the descriptions in Managing Internetworks with SNMP were not so clear.  So far it has been able to answer every question I have had regarding SNMP 
 I read this book a couple of years ago, and I have just recently started to read it again. As much as I liked Lonsome Dove and Larry McMurtry's ability to wrenches your heart by eliminating characters you fall for; Greg  Matthews stings your senses with the characters he develops 
 no it's not a perfect CD, but as it was a benefit for the Harvey Milk School  in NYC for gay/lesbian/transgender and other in-need students, it's worth getting it regardless. I just saw the "Follow my Voice" documentary about the making of this CD and the school. It was very moving and interesting to learn about these kids who can really thrive when they get out of the unsafe environments they have at home or in their old schools because of their orientation. Please support this worthwhile program 
 I've been fortunate enough to have known about this band for time since I lived about fifteen minutes outside of Cresco while I was in High School. This album is really good, and I think everyone should give it a listen. But since this album's release, the band has gone through some tough times. I don't know exactly what happened, but somehow the band lost their record deal and drummer T.J. Krammer was either let go/fired or quit because of creative differences. At any rate, they have a new CD out that's pretty good, but it's a hard find since the band doesn't have the record deal anymore. If you are looking to buy, "All Lights Off" go ahead and do it. You won't regret it. However, consider buying their new self-titled album too. You can't get it here, but visit www.rvmonline.com and there will be a link to buy the record. It's different, but still really good. If you really like the band, they also have an older small time release entitled "Blown Out." I don't believe it's for sale anymore, but there's a site where you can download it for free. Just go to the forum on the official site and you'll find the link to Rearview Mirror source. Anyway, spread the word. This band is great, and they need your support 
 I really enjoyed this cd. It is one of the few cd's that you buy were you can actually enjoy more than one song on it. My favorite is "Presence of the Lord" and "Glory to Your Name". I sit in my car and listen to these songs over and over again. I also highly recommend Chicago Mass Choir Live in Nashville. These two cds are a God send 
 Excellent resource.  Includes basics and how to's.  Could have been better if brand names were included 
 This is the best movie ever made! The best character in this movie was Little J played by Stephen Baldwin! I dont own the DVD version though, I have the VHS! I'm Looking forward to having the DVD just to brag about it to all my friends 
 This book was recommended by my son's therapist for us to read as a new way to parent.  I found the book quite interesting and it gave me some new thoughts.  We have incorporated some of the suggestions in the book and have had a lot of success with it.  I'm not sure if I could do all the responses to certain situations, but many chapters in which there were responses that we could use.  It does take an open minded parent, and those parents who are drill sgt. parents will have a tough time using this book unless they are willing to change.  
 I waited until March 2007 to take the hd plunge, and I bought this from Amazon for 375 with shipping and 5 free rebate from Toshiba. I have to say it has the awesome picture and sound! I have a 32" HP lcd at 1080i, and it looks superb. I have only had a couple of instances of lip sync problems that the new firmware update cd should fix. For now I just start the chapter over and it works fine. 2-3 times out of 50 or so dvd's I've played. Not bad. It loads fast, I've played very scratched discs from Netflix without any problems whatsover! I may get a Blu Ray eventually when the price drops enough, only to watch things exclusive to that format. I say, enjoy hd dvd now, build your library, and more are on the way all the time. You won't want to go back to regular dvd's after this 
 I have not read the book only listened to the tape (the book is on back order).  I and my wife have a deep and long time love for our 6 (yes six) cats and these tapes only served to not only deepen those feelings but to better understand how our lives are so much better because of them.  I also work with students in the field of patient care (people patients)and will use this set of tapes to help them better understand those patients that they will be working with once out of school.  If we are able to give unconditional love for others the way cats give there love.... oh what a wonderful world it would be 
 I have lived in East Africa, on-and-off, for over 5 years.  Having lived in both Ethiopia and Uganda, I was blown away by Berkeley's accurate depiction of the modern history of this region. This book is a must read for anybody wanting to learn about current affairs in Africa, and Africa's stance in the modern geo-political arena. 
 This is an incredible book.  We highly recommend it if you're interested in propagation and/or growing as a nursery or if you simply want to propagate more of your own plants for your personal landscaping.  This book has everything you need to know to do it.  It's well worth the money 
 "Bill, suppose I told you that everything that happened to you there...suppose I said that all of that was staged, that it was a kind of charade? That it was fake?"  Victor Ziegler's words explaining away the bizarre orgy that his friend, Dr. Bill Harford, crashed the night before might be a more accurate description of Warner Bros' marketing campaign for Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut."   After Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then a real-life couple, were cast in the lead roles, the media hype was that Kubrick's final film was about sex, jealousy, infidelity, and the pitfalls of temptation, all of which certainly seemed to be the theme judging by the trailer over which Chris Isaak was heard singing "Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing." Most critics and the public swallowed the bait and saw the film with their own eyes wide shut.    "Eyes Wide Shut" is not really about sex at all, nor is it about "the elusive ambiguity of dream and reality," as the back cover of the published screenplay claims.   LIke most of Kubrick's films, "Eyes Wide Shut" is so rich and multi-layered that it requires multiple viewings before its meaning becomes clear. Even then, much of it remains mystifying. But this much can be understood: "Eyes Wide Shut" is an expose of the world's elite and the occultic rituals they engage in on a regular basis. The bizarre ritual that Tom Cruise's character witnesses is more than mere hedonism, hence the cloaks, the masks, and the bizarre, almost churchly music. It is a Satanic ritual, and Ziegler is right when he tells Harford he wouldn't sleep so well if he knew the names of those participating.   Just as Ziegler tried to white-wash the events, the media deliberately tried to control the public's perception of Kubrick's film. Ziegler is a little more honest. He prefaces his remarks with the word "suppose," a hint to Harford and the audience that he's telling Harford a bit of fiction in the hope of dissuading him from pursuing the matter further.     And what are we to make of Alice Harford's "dreams"? And what about the daugher of Milich, the costume shop proprietor, whose father doubles as her pimp?  Alice's dreams are more likely flashbacks to real incidents when she was victimized by the government's MK-Ultra mind control program that was exposed in Congressional hearings and which Kubrick touched on in his 1971 film of Anthony Burgess' novel, "Clockwork Orange."    One question is how did Kubrick ever manage to make "Eyes Wide Shut" for a studio which is believed to be controlled by the very kind of people he was exposing?   Following the success of "2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick was in an enviable position. Warner Bros. lured the world's most innovative filmmaker to their stable by offering him carte blanche. Kubrick's clout was such that he could even convince the studio to withdraw the very profitable and critically acclaimed "Clockwork Orange" from UK cinemas when he feared his family would be targets of violence from those who misunderstood the film. Kubrick was free to make the films of his choosing without interference from the studio, and always worked under strict security, keeping the nature of his work a secret even from those who were providing the budget. It's doubtful Warner Bros. realized what Kubrick had achieved with "Eyes Wide Shut" until they saw the finished film four months before its release. But like Cruise's Dr. Harford, Kubrick may have wandered out of his depth. On March 7, 1999, only four days after Warner Bros. got its first glimpse at the much ballyhooed production, Kubrick unexpectedly died, exactly 666 days before the dawn of 2001, the year he made famous with his landmark 1968 film.   Yes, 666 as in the mark of the beast.   Coincidence? Conspiracy?   Aside from its themes, "Eyes Wide Shut" is as impressive as all of Kubrick's films. The production design, cinematography, and music are as flawless as they are unforgettable. The performances are also top notch. Tom Cruise, whose acting skills are often dismissed, is at his best here, playing a man whose jealousy leads him down a path where he learns much more than he suspected about the circles in which he socializes. Kidman is good, too, though she has some early moments when she unconvincingly overacts. Pollock as Ziegler shows he's still a better actor than a director (though he's not too shabby behind the camera either), and there's Leon Vitali, who played Lord Bullingdon in "Barry Lyndon" before working behind-the-scenes on Kubrick's last three films, as the sinister Red Cloak.   "Eyes Wide Shut" may be Kubrick's most daring work. It is certainly one of his finest. If your own eyes remain shut to the truths of this film, it's recommended you see it again, this time as a double feature with Alex Jones' "Inside Bohemian Grove," available on DVD with the equally informative "Order of Death."

 We just got these for a trip to Alaska. I LOVE them! They are so easy to share. The sharpness of the image is AMAZING! My Dad wears glasses and I don't. No problem. We can both see CLEARLY! The amazing part is he doesn't need to have his glasses on! My husbands eyesight is completely different than mine, same story.Very cool item! Very well constructed. Highly recommended 
 Fountas and Pinnell reach right into the heart of effective guided reading in the elementary classroom.  Their book provides a clear plan for implementing a student-centered, learner-driven, EFFECTIVE guided reading  program.  Included are organizational strategies, templates, and  bibliographies to help both beginning and veteren teachers take advantage  of an approach that serves the needs of all children in diverse classrooms.   These guided reading goddesses explain not just the WHY, but the HOW - HOW  to actually conduct guided reading lessons, how to manage the data gathered  from these lessons, and how to create a learning atmosphere that is  supportive of all students, not just the brightest or those who happen to  be sitting at the teacher's table at that moment.  These edxpert teachers  remind us that guided reading is NOT about creating "easy",  static groups; rather, they help teachers see that guided reading addresses  NEEDS, and that these student needs are fluid.  Using Fountas and Pinnell's  strategies for implementing guided reading, any teacher can create the  flexible, needs-based and responsivce groupings that children require to  achieve progress in reading.  A must for all teachers 
 We loved Stomp, but Stomp Out Load was even more creative.  It's a must for percussionists, dancers--and a lot of fun for most anyone else. 
 After 2+ years, the camera's original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge.  This replacement battery arrived promptly, fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours.  I wish I had replaced the battery sooner, instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power 
 I was skeptical about the quality of these knives due to the low price of $39.99. But after reading the other reviews, I was willing to give this a shot.  I've been wanting to buy a set of Henckels for a while now. The current knives I was using were sub-par. I was very surprised to see what great quality knives these were! Finally, I have a great set of knives that I can cook with. I feel like an iron chef in my kitchen  =)  O yeah, there's extra slots in the butcher block in case you wanted to keep expanding your knife set. The only draw back to the block was that it didn't include a slot for kitchen shears AND it didn't come with steak knives (which my previous set did) 
 Instead of with Linda....  And with the songs serving as an outlet for severe personal and financial problems - As if McCartney needed to write a song like Layla...    That's how I've often thought of this CD. Great guitar work, and lots of big melodies.  There's plenty of details in the other reviews, so I'll just add that Pete Ham is in his usual fine (musical) form here, and it's undoubtedly Joey Molland's finest hour.  It took dire straits for the band, but Molland never sounded as inspired as he does here.  An odd thing I noticed after reading the Badfinger bio - In the closing verse to Dennis, a great Pete Ham song, the phrase "There's A Way Through" is repeated many times - reportedly the same phrase as Ham's final words to Tom Evans shortly before his death... 
 Let me first say that I don't care much for Scotch. Actually let me refine that statement a bit-- Up and until recently I didn't care much for Scotch, due in large part to my utter and complete ignorance of the subject. That and the fact that my impressions of Scotch drinkers was one of boorish stock brokers bellied up to a bar pouring money down the drain faster then they could the whisky into their over fattened gullets.  In short I was constrained by ignorance, and quite frankly intimidation. The glistening row of top shelf bottles were as mysterious and as impenetrable as any exclusive country club. My head spun with questions. How does one even start? Should I simply order the most expensive one, and assume its the best? or should I start with the least expensive and work my way up?  Over Rocks? Neat? Single malt? Blends? What's with the missing 'E' in Whisky?  Clear, concise, and to the point (and slim enough to carry on your person whilst traipsing about the local waterholes), this book provides the foundations for a beginner, defines the mandatory nomenclature, and dispels many myths.  Mr. Erskines book has been almost wholly responsible for an eye opening education on the subject, and a growing appreciation of the drink, culture and history. Two thumbs up, 5 stars and a solid purchase 
  After watching this author's award-winning Gnosis DVD, I revisited the book and was stunned to find that I, too, finally understood the secrets of Solomon's Temple and Freemasonry. This was especially important to me as my great-grandfather was a Scottish stone mason that had been hired by the LDS to help in the construction of The Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City circa 1850's. Although we were not a religious family at all -- and clearly not a member of anything secular or sacred at that time -- I started to see the significance of bloodlines for the first-time, and why as an adult I chose engineering as a profession myself, at least initially. More so, everywhere I lived from the Southeastern US to the Pacific Northwest I had this compulsion to build, so I'd buy a separate plot of land close to my residence and spend every free hour constructing barns, fences and houses that I never would even live in; it was as if it were in my DNA to do manual labor. Guess what, it is and I likewise grasped the deeper meaning to the Holy Grail and the Da Vinci Code. Read this book and you too will become alive to the legends in your family tree and the "serpent power" spiraling within your body-mind-spirit awaiting to manifest a whole new life in the future from your blood, sweat, and tears shed in the past!

 Marianne Moore's poetry is perceptive and unassuming. She often writes with a dry sense of humor. Her interest in sports, especially baseball, is also expressed in her poetry. She enjoys odd behavior in animals and writes  about them just as they are. "An Octopus" is one of her longer  poems and needs several readings to be appreciated. Moore creates poems  that are filled with intuitive insight and beauty 
 	Tros is the daring captain of his trireme, and the son of Perseus, an initiate of the mysteries of Samothrace who was murdered by Caesar.  Tros fights back by helping to repulse Caesar's invasion of Britain.  Bold and crafty, like a true adventurer Tros wants to avoid fighting, but circumstances draw him into it, forcing him to battle the injustice around him.  A warrior philosopher and navigator, Tros represents the adventurers and explorers, who value chivalry, honor and freedom, and will outlast Rome.  However, Tros is no reckless swashbuckler, mercenary or fortune hunter; his opposition to Caesar is more than revenge.  Unlike many of his powerful contemporaries, Tros has a highly developed, almost modern moral sense, and he is labeled a pirate only by his Roman adversaries.  Although he makes use of guile, Tros is a man of conscience who is monogamous and loyal, despising the treachery and treason he sees all around him.   	Tros of Samothrace is full of delightful, vibrant supporting characters.  There are numerous battles and murders, together with incidents of conspiracy and loyalty, as Tros struggles to build his advanced ship, the Liafail, and aid the Britons against Caesar.   	The saga is a vast, sweeping, spectacular panorama, full of detail, with its principal setting in Britain, although the final part of the saga, takes Tros directly into Rome itself, from the Vestal Virgins to the Arena.  It is told in an energetic, dynamic style, full of dash and gusto, that still conveys both the feeling of the time and the authenticity of the characters as history and fiction blend naturally.  Mundy reverses the traditional reverential, historicized language, using narration and dialogue that partake equally of a modern idiom, by endowing his characters with contemporary motivations and moods.  	Although a hero, Tros is aware of his limitations, wise enough to be influenced by the esoteric religious thought of Samothrace, but not wise enough to qualify for initiation, lacking his father's ability to follow his vision without diversion.  Mundy dwells on a more occult form of religion, the mysteries.  Mundy asserts that both the Samothracians and the Druids had their foundation in the same ancient wisdom from which theosophy arose, the same mother religion from which all others are derived.  This concept provides moral grounding as well as facilitating the narrative.   	Caesar and Tros are drawn as the antithesis of each other, spiritual opposites; Tros represents the waning influence of the ancient mysteries, which Mundy proclaimed "were based on the theory of universal brotherhood."  Caesar represents militarism and treachery, and understands, according to Tros, "that where the wisdom dwells, freedom persists and grows again . . . ."   	As I outline in my book, Talbot Mundy, Philosopher of Adventure, Mundy was living at the Point Loma theosophical community at the time of composing Tros of Samothrace.  This helped to inspire the unconventional approach to history Mundy took with his heretical and unflattering portrait of Caesar in his novels.   	Mundy believed that Caesar's materialism and lack of spiritual awareness had adversely affected all of the subsequent cultural institutions that had come to idolize him.  The implications for the foundations of modern Western civilization was recognized by readers of Adventure.  Mundy explained, "The purpose of the Roman empire was to make life comfortable for the Romans and to keep other people out of mischief [and it] was conducted on principles diametrically opposite to those taught by all the world's really great philosophers."  He blames Rome for imperialism and its destructive impact.  He notes that England similarly justified its rule of India by making the land apparently incapable of self-government, then trying to ease the resentment of conquest by offering defeated peoples a place within the empire.  "Here, today, is the net result of Roman theories--war, mistrust, rancor, suspicion, hatred, misgovernment, and a world not half so civilized as China was two thousand years ago."   	Although the Tros stories were very popular, they were the most controversial Mundy ever wrote, and many readers in the 1920s were shocked by his defiance of tradition and anti-classical views.  There was a storm of protest during the serialization of the initial Tros stories, lasting almost a year, and a vast correspondence in Adventure debated the merits of Mundy's case until enough letters were printed to be considered for publication themselves in book form; it was the largest such confrontation ever in any pulp.  Readers and contributors included not only subscribers but authors and professors, and the debate was widely followed by a literary community that respected Adventure as falling outside the purview of "mere pulps."  	Eventually a consensus formed, cautiously siding with Mundy.  The Tros series was able to be critically acclaimed because it combined adventure with the unusual twist of a distinctly revisionist spirit--permitting the tales to be respectable within the intellectual community as well as enjoyable diversion.   	When Tros of Samothrace appeared in book form in 1934 it acquired another sort of timeliness not evident during its original serialization.  Mundy's theme of liberty subverted by those who would increase their own power had a topical resonance beyond history in the 1930s.  Contemporary readers saw in Tros's battle against Caesar's designs of conquering the world an analogy for the contemporary increase in militarism and the necessity to fight the steadily growing threat of fascism.  Mundy was aware of this relevance; in his foreword to the British edition of Tros of Samothrace in 1934 he noted that both Lenin and Hitler were following in Caesar's footsteps by trying to destroy through propaganda the old belief in spiritual values.    
 Dry and Running with Scissors were incredible.  Possible Side Effects is also a great read, only it's slightly less edgy and slightly less consistent than the other two were.  ?Maybe less editing?  But if you liked Dry and Running you will like Possible 
 In Aberdeen Mists, Colorado, Paige Atwell knows she is bored with her marriage of twelve years to faithful Paul and staying at home to raise their two elementary school age children, Chloe and Spencer.  However, how much ennui has set in over the dozen years comes to a head (no pun intended) when her married neighbor Karen confesses that she has been in a hot affair with a compassionate Latin lover Javier.  Paige agrees sex should be spontaneous and euphoric not scheduled and mechanic.  She decides it is up to her to recharge her relationship by "re-sexualize" the passion.  However before she can generate her sex campaign, her neighbor Karen is found dead in her garage in what looks like an accident.  Paige and three other coffee moms think otherwise as they believe Karen's spouse Doug learned of Javier and perhaps she was leaving him so he killed her making it look like an accident.  Believing they are experts after watching TV police shows, the coffee mamas begin their brand of investigation.  This cross between Desperate Housewives, Stella gets Her Groove, and CSI is an amusing contemporary tale especially when Paige's planned spontaneous sexual escapades lead to mortifying moments.  The lighthearted story line is fun especially the family interludes, but goes over the edge during the amateur sleuth inquiry.  Still fans will enjoy Paige's attack on her spouse and uncovering the identity of a killer while changing peed on sheets.  Harriet Klausner 
 One of the most important question you can ask that will affect your entire destiny it is, "How do I hear the Voice of God?"  Written in a style that it more a personal counseling session that literature, this book will bring comfort to a confused heart 
 I am a college student at a school that doesn't offer Arabic as a language, and I wanted to learn it on my own without taking away too much time from my other studies (including another language- Russian).  As someone who doesn't have an incredible amount of time to devote to the subject, and as someone with absolutely no knowledge of arabic whatsoever coming into it, this book is an EXCELLENT introduction to reading and writing the language.  The book is broken down very simply, devoting time to each letter and the different ways they are written.  The alphabet is known as a very difficult one for Westerners to master, especially when teaching oneself, but this book made the process very easy for me without taking much time.  I highly recommend it  to anyone who is learning this language for the first time, as the alphabet itself is the base off of which to learn everything else about the language.  Fantastic 
 This is a wonderful book.  It shows you a lot of classic quilt styles and compares two excellent versions of each style.  All the quilts are priced, and the reasons for the valuation of each quilt are explained with easy-to-understand call-outs.  My only regret is that this book hasn't been turned into a series.  Whether you're a experienced collector or a newbie, you'll love this book 
 Written in 1948, this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime Brits in a poor backwater in West Africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality. Foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both Henry Scobie, the honest policeman of this coastal town, and his "literary" wife, Louise, who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local British "club" members who constantly mind one another's business. Scobie no longer loves his wife but can't bring himself to hurting her. He simply pities her. And Louise no longer loves Henry and wants desperately to escape from West Africa, especially when she finds out that her "Ticki" has been passed up for promotion to Commissioner. The atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man, Wilson, appears on the scene and, in his youthful stupidity, falls in love with Louise while he conducts secret investigations on British authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through Africa to Germany. Scobie is one of those suspects. A marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt Syrian merchant, Yusef, is thrown into the mix. I can see Sidney Greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation. Add jealousy, desperation, a contrast of honesty and lies, sex, and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains. O yes, and then, as always, there's the brilliant writing of Graham Greene, his wonderful metaphors, crystal clear descriptions, and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters. All this equals a modern classic. My only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding Catholicism, a religion I cannot stomach anymore, and my personal disbelief that someone like Scobie can take Catholicism so seriously. But this is my own thing. Greene remains brilliant, original, and indeed, "the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety," or at least one of the top five 
 My mom has this Xmas Nikko set and likes it.  I thought it was kinda trashy to have a two gallon milk jug sitting on the dinner table, so I bought this for her.  
 Bless her heart, Mary Kay Andrews has written this precious book with characters so uniquely Southern that I'm sure that I could be related to many of them. However, the universality of love, greed, passion, and family transcends any regional or cultural boundaries. Grab yourself a glass of tea, get comfortable, and read. You'll soothe your heart and lighten your burdens. 
 A book about nature could be boring, but Douglas Adams writes with a humorous, and sometimes touching, attitude 
 This book is a page-turner and hard to put down, though at times one must put it down to absorb the shock of the information. Many will be surprised, and actually horrified how the government within a government worked behind the scenes for many years up to the present. I highly recommend this book and ignore and am amused at those who desire to continue to keep the information hidden and suppressed 
 This is an exceptional book. The author has done a masterful job of presenting "heavy" material in an entertaining manner. The "12 letter" approach used by Zip Dobbyns is made more understandable in this book and I particularly like the use of  "principles" substituted for "letters" because it seems  to broaden the horizons of astrology . I also like the fact that Mr.  Tierney, while respecting the views of the sticklers for "political  correctness" found a way to spare us the cumbersome "he/she"  writing style. I love the humor interspersed at various intervals which  lightens the sometimes too solemn/serious approach of practitioners of  astrology. The book also clarifies the subtle differences between house and  sign and makes crystal clear the differences and similarities between sign  and planet. This book is a valuable addition to the astrological literature  of the modern world and is valuable for beginners and professionals alike!  As one who has studied astrology for 30 years, I applaud the author for his  fresh, original approach to a fascinating subject 
 From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones.  Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story.  Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story.  It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane.  By the end I felt I knew her.    The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault.  There are many places in the book that could have been shortened.  I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.    It is a lovely story.  I recommend it if you hunger for a love story.  It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it. 
 This book outlines a very readable, very achievable program that is easy to follow, and yet feels challenging enough to feel effective. It begins assuming you have never tried an exercise program before, and that approach is helpful and always boosts self-esteem.  Personally, I found this book perfect for me. I am nineteen and at college. I had mononucleosis for over a month. While I was recovering, I found that all my muscles had become very weak. I needed something to strengthen me again, and I browsed many exercise books before choosing this one. It helped me build good, healthy habits, and I do not feel like the exercise program is consuming my life, which is a good thing, as I am always very busy. I completed the ninety days mentioned in the title, and already I feel much stronger and healthier than I did when I began. I have lost weight and I feel like dancing a lot more than I used to. I wholeheartedly recommend this book 
 This is one of my favorite magic books.  I have to go back and look at it from time to time.  Great stories- great pictures. -Diamond Jim Tyle 
 The best science fiction uses speculation about science to accomplish the projection of us as humans into worlds and situations outside of the everyday, to test and propose how we would act and react in such a situation. In other words, it's about people, albeit in the context of space, aliens, time travel, technology, etc. The best works of Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, etc are all science fiction, but even more they are great works of fiction.  Robinson's Mars trilogy are in that tradition, and compare well to those classics. They provide not only a realistic (enough) projection of science and technology, but more importantly are about how we as people might behave under those circumstances. They are about not only science but also history, sociology, biology, geology, psychology, along with economics and politics.   They are not just whiz-bang shoot-em-up rocket chases, but rather gripping human stories of how people can scratch out a living in a harsh environment, and learn to grow both as people and as a community. Robinson's technique of telling each major chapter from the point of view of a different character gives depth to each point of view, while maintaining the plot thread weaving it all together.  These are books that will drag you into their world and make you think, as well as be entertained. And possibly learn how to skim ahead through the long, detailed descriptions of the landscapes after the first few 
 This is the tale of a man who died for what he believed in.  This man valiantly and tirelessly fought for our national security by warning his office and our government about bin Laden's impending threats. His warnings which may have enabled us to protect our country against 9/11 fell on the deaf ears of the FBI, CIA, Clinton and Bush.  He was an amazing man who lead an amazing life.  This is a MUST READ.  
 I love Dalene's book, it is a great resource for the flower beader, whether you are new at it or experienced. Her instructions are clear and her diagrams are great. She is such a talented artist, her work is beautiful and her willingness to share her skills is apparent in her book.  (I also love the personal comments she has included with the patterns!)  This book will not only help you through some tight spots when practicing flower beading but it will inspire you to be creative with this lovely art form 
 When Veronica (Ronnie) Swan was 12 years old and baby sitting her two younger sisters, Scott Early, an emotionally disturbed man, wandered in off the street and brutally murdered the two little girls while Ronnie was being "it" in a game of hide and seek. He was seized by the police but after trials and tests, was declared unfit to plead and was incarcerated in a mental institution for 3 years, before being released as recovered and normal. Ronnie's parents, practicing Mormans, elected to forgive the man but Ronnie struggled to find any feeling of forgiveness for him, much to her parent's sorrow. As a young adult, she located the Early's and infiltrated their home, using another name, as a sitter for their baby daughter. Eventually Early recognises her and the consequences of that recognition are catastrophic. The book brought me to the brink of tears several times as I don't think that I's have the charity or enough love for my fellow man to forgive this appalling crime, despite knowing that I probably should 
 This book was recommended to me by my sensei and I am pleased to share it with others. This is a book of lists, quizzes, and general tips and information presented in an extremely well-organized and interesting manner. It clearly points out key information and has helped me greatly with my studies. Most sources are either overwhelmingly detailed or oversimplified and it is difficult to sort through and figure out key concepts. This book does the work for you and is a convenient (and very portable!) challenging study guide.  This is one of the very few sources of information about Fukyugata San available, with photos and descriptions of Ueshiro Sensei performing the kata.   There are a few errors/debatable answers in the book (the kata information list is a good example), so if something doesn't seem right to you, check other places. This book is by no means a complete resource, but is invaluable when used with other sources of information. 
 Although different from earlier releases, make no mistake this brilliant and ambitious album retains the MCR trademark.  Earlier MCR albums (which I also like very much), have had a greater sense of urgency and spontaneity - The Black Parade is measured, deliberate and focused.   The Black Parade is a Concept (thematic) album based on the voyage through the death process of "the patient".  Unlike "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge" their second album (also a concept album), the metaphor and fiction have not been plied as thickly - the audience is lead on a journey that is in essence a thinly veiled reflective analysis of Gerard Way's (lead vocals and lyricist), own life.  Growing up as a somewhat overweight introverted nerdy kid, who was ostracised by the mainstream, Gerard initially pursued a career as a comic book illustrator, but quickly became disillusioned after working in the industry.  Having witnessed events of 9/11 on his way to work, he decided to do something more meaningful with his life....that something became music.  After forming the band, MCR very quickly exploded into popularity and Gerard found himself catapulted to rock icon status - initially his coping mechanism for rite of passage being pills and alcohol, which almost pulled the band apart.  Now well free of the chemical props, Gerard has embraced his position as "rock star" and driving force of a band that will surely find a position in rock history. This album is very much about putting the uglier moments of his life under the microscope.  Musically, the band has matured and gained a greater sense of artistic confidence - allowing them to take risks to explore different musical styles.  Yes of course they have incorporated sounds and styles from other artists and genres (and how many other artists haven't), but they do it in such a way as to retain MCR integrity.  We are exposed to a lot more of Gerard's vocal capability (somewhat buried in the more chaotic layers of guitars, yelling and screaming of earlier albums), the guitar work is much more skilful and "positioned", and a broader range of instruments have been introduced to the suite of sounds - all adding to richer, more multidimensional pieces of work.  Each song is a stand alone gem, different from the next - varying in tempo and style to suit the message. The lyrics are simpler, direct and more visually powerful than those of previous albums.  This album is evidence of a band that has a greater sense of clarity about their music and what they want to say through it.  Sadly, it's likely that this album will see the loss of MCR's hardcore emo/punk fans, but the gain is a broader audience who can appreciate the music for what it is rather than something from a genre the band supposedly represents.  I have added The Black Parade to my all time favourite classic album list, but for those who are uncertain, at least listen to it all the way through - it is most deserving of your attention.  
 Fareed Zakaria is an excellent foreign policy analyst and this book is no different.  He argues that without a strong middle class, democracy is doomed to fail, and in fact can make things worse.  One cannot help to see what is happening in the middle east right now, where oil-rich nations elect terrorist-supporting officials.  Contrary to the Bush doctrine, forced-upon democracy is not the answer to our world's greatest threat.  A must-read. 
 One of the most original works in all of literature. Ranks with Austin Tappin Wrights "Islandia", W.H. Hodgson's "The Nightland", Lovecraft's "The Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath". E.R. Eddison's "The Worm Ouronoros, and Peake's "Titus Groan", among the greatest fantasy novels ever written. Read it! But be prepared for the utterly weird. 
  	This film is now commonly viewed as Werner Herzog's international breakthrough. Which unfortunately is another myth that has sprung up around the film. Lauded and adored by critics and academia perhaps, the general cinema going public were and still remain unaware of Herzog's work. But it certainly is a creative breakthrough and the reasons for this, is that by Herzog standards this is a very conventional piece of story-telling. It is replete with action, conspiracy, adventure and danger and from a narrative perspective owes a good deal of debt to classic Hollywood adventure films. Where it differs is in Herzog's own unique lexicon of film language, his use of camera, editing and soundtrack combine to   give the film a documentary feel. This often works in an opposite way in Herzog's cinema as well, with his documentaries having the heightened, fantastical lucidity of a fictional narrative. The film also highlighted to a wider audience Herzog's propensity to take risks and the efforts he goes to in order to achieve the `ecstatic truth' he has sought throughout his career. In AGUIRRE this is best represented by the breathtaking opening sequence.   	This film also establishes the twin themes that have been present throughout Herzog's work since, that of colonialist expansion and the effect of western civilisation on the African continent and the exploration of dreams. In this case the dreams of AGUIRRE are negative and fuelled by a slowly burgeoning insanity. And a major delight of this film is KLAUS KINSKI'S towering performance of scheming malevolence. Rarely has an actor dominated a film quite as much.  Herzog also painstakingly presents nature as harsh, unforgiving and beyond the mere comprehension of a man, a theme he still explores successfully to this day as his recent film GRIZZLY MAN illustrates. If one can ignore the mythical tales of hardship and insanity that dog this film, it is an incredible experience that makes a fine companion piece to both Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS and Herzog's own FITZCARRALDO.  	Anchor Bay's DVD is unfortunately devoid of the type of extras we have become used to from the company. But we should be glad that they have taken of the task of re-mastering Herzog's films and bringing them to the attention of the DVD generation of film collectors. The commentary track is good value for money, Herzog remains as always fascinating listening. 
 Those who come to Singer's book expecting to be applauded for their preconceived notions of right and wrong may be disappointed.  Singer's book is actually one long argument for his particular brand of consequentialist ethics, and it leaves aside any mollifying lip-service to contract ethics, deontological ethics, or relativist thinking.  It refuses to traffic in over-simplified religious notions of morality, or in ethical systems based upon sheer self-interest.  Singer is interested in a reasoned approach to ethics, and this is exactly what he delivers.  In this book, you will be introduced early to the basic principles of Singer's utilitarian ethics, and these principles will be reviewed again and again as the argument builds from issues of basic equality, through animal rights and medical ethics, to the ethics of international relations and environmentalism.  The argument is cumulative, building upon itself in clear steps as it goes along.  While I've read some folks who clearly don't get what Singer has to say, I think that can only happen when we let our own prejudices get in the way of understanding the book.  I've never read a clearer account of an ethical system anywhere.  You may not agree with what Singer has to say.  Many don't.  But if you approach this book as an honest reader, rather than as a person hunting for reasons to be angry or offended, then you will find an elegance to Singer's approach which is to be found nowhere else.  If this kind of honest reading is outside your range of interests, you may wish to ask yourself why you are reading philosophy in the first place.  The most compelling part of the book, for me, was Singer's thorough and patient discussion of the Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests.  This principle, combined with a universal view of ethics and a healthy respect for realistic circumstances, can take the place of much more convoluted conceptions of rights and duties.  I found the idea liberating when I first encountered it, and it has proved very "teachable" in my classroom.  Towards the end of the book, Singer makes some claims that I found myself questioning, but these claims did not detract seriously from my enjoyment of the book.  Nor did they undermine the overall power of Singer's argument.  I highly recommend this book to people who are looking for a clear, consistent approach to humanist ethics.  I also recommend it to those who enjoy reading carefully crafted arguments.  The book may make you squirm.  It may make you question your own practices.  But it will not bore you 
 As he does in his other novels, here Dostoevsky, uses alienation, inner struggle, humiliation and suffering to underscore the ambiguities of the meaning of life and as a way of questioning the basic rules of humanity as well as the traditional rules and values of society.  The first half of book demonstrates how boredom, meaninglessness, self-doubt, and an overly active intellect conspire to mask man's fear and lack of courage to act in defense of his own right to be. This lack of courage, and the intellectual devices used to cover it up (rationalization, social excuses, etc.), ultimately immobilizes man, and estranges him from his inner self, thus, preventing him from being able to measure his true worth and calibrate his true degree of aliveness. In this sense, the psychological analysis of the Underground Man is a classic Freudian-Existential analysis, performed a half century before Freud was born.  The second half of the book carries a companion theme about how pain and suffering brought on by isolation and self-doubt can lay bare the true underlying meaning of the human condition. It reveals how, in an effort to muster the courage to act in the moment, that the essence of being alive is about the will to move beyond intellectualizations and rationalizations. Or said another way: only when he is broken down to the level of the most extreme degradation and embarrassment can man begin to accept himself and then be able to rebuild and prepare himself for a life of redemption, true love and understanding.  What Dostoevsky does so well in both The Underground Man and in Crime and Punishment is carry to the limit what man is unable to do - how we are utterly immobilized by our inner fears and incapacity to act. He shows what the consequences are (for our being and our humanity) when we mistake our cowardice for reasonableness, and use it as a substitute for acting.   A failure to live is precisely to be faced with the consequences of being alive, but instead of acting, we "sleep-walk through life," using psychological ruses to make ourselves feel better about dodging the consequences of "having a real life."   Left alone with our cowardice, Dostoevsky says, we become entangled and lost--we don't know what to join, what to keep up with; what to love, what to hate; what to respect, or what to despise.  We become so out of touch with our "real being" that we long to turn ourselves into the hypothetical "average man." (p 203).    In the catatonia of this self-made mental prison, often crime or other modalities of rebelling and acting out against society are the only viable ways out. That is to say, rebelling against the rules of society is the only way to feel truly alive and in control of one's being.  In Crime and Punishment, for instance, it is Raskolnikov's murders that does this; in Notes From the Underground, it is the Underground Man's sexual seduction of a prostitute at a party that does so.  In each novel, the criminal act serves as the cathartic way of restoring meaning and balance to lives immobilized by the fear of being unable to act.    Dostoevsky's most powerful and recurring theme ultimately is almost religious in its content and its subtext: that self-redemption and salvation are the ultimate liberator of the soul and can come only through humiliation and suffering. However, while Rakolnikov in Crime and Punishment surrenders to God and Christianity through the love of a prostitute.  The underground man rejects love and overtures to turn his freedom over to those who consider themselves morally superior to him.    The Underground Man is the clearest, most succinct and most powerful statement of Dostoevsky's existentialist philosophy.  It is a beautiful read.  Ten stars 
 Now eclipsed by the Streep-Redford film presentation that appropriated its title, Karen Blixen's memoir of life on her Kenyan coffee farm speaks movingly of the more benign side of colonialism in Africa and of one European's self-evident love for the land she had made her own.  Sadly, Blixen's lush descriptions of 'her people' are often judged too quickly by modern criteria of racial attitudes, a game that is like asking this early twentieth-century writer to wrestle with one arm tied behind her back. If it can be granted that there was anything good about Europe's colonization of Africa, then Bliksen (Isak Dinesen was her pen name) is its face.  She loved the land and its people, entering about as far as was plausible in her time into the remarkable rhythm of both. What more can be asked of any of us, all children of our moment and enveloped in its limitations?  This is a book for lovers of Africa, no matter whence they come. Blixen not only pushed an eloquent pen, she was herself shaped in the biblical and classical language of educated Europeans in a way that prepared her to bridge Africa and Europe in a day when few were equipped to do so.  Blixen's Africa no longer exists, as she already realized within the window of her writing of OUT OF AFRICA and SHADOWS ON THE GRASS. Yet the Africa Blixen knew has children, not to be disinherited for the generations that have passed and the unsavory disease that a legacy of failed leaders has wrought upon this great continent. Though the primary fruit of reaching behind the celluloid to *read* OUT OF AFRICA is the satisfaction of the read itself, it is also true that today's Africa and today's Africans can be glimpsed in the great-grandparents who knew and lived in proximity to this enigmatic and uniquely gifted Danish colonist in a land she mistreated only by calling it hers 
 It doesn't get any better than this.  Dan's ability to communicate by thoroughly explaining and then demonstrating is excellent.  You may never need to use all of the included techniques but this publication is a resource that is unmatched for content relative to the imaging industry. I purchased additional copies as gifts 
 I thought this was a great book especially to a layperson who may not completely understand all the technical terms.  I thought the way that he laid out the book made it very easy to read.  A lot of time books written for science are way too technical to enjoy.  I like how he explained the general area "Cerebral Georgraphy" then shared his interviews with other professionals from different institutions from around the world.  Good structure.  Read it especially if you want to learn more about the brain and developments you can expect to see in the coming years 
 This book is about the tale of Salamanca and Phoebe, with their disappearing mothers. Salamanca tells her grandparents about this tale when she was suck with them for 6 days to visit her mother. I like this book as it has suspense, creativity and consistent. This book should definitely be published. I think that the author is able to engage the reader and make the reader have suspense. The author tells the story bit by bit, stopping at the appropriate time and returning the reality. This is so as she wants the reader to want to continue reading. I feel that Sharon Creech is very creative as she manages to effectively put two different lives together, making the story more interesting. Using this method, she is able to let the story have comparison between how Salamanca and Pheobe felt when their mothers left them. The author is very consistent as throughout the book, she portrays Salamanca as a stubborn and a person that values love and friendship, while she portrays Pheobe as a worrywart and a person that is very defensive of her family. Again, I recommend you to publish this book. I believe that many people will enjoy reading this book. I would like to read the book again if I have the chance to do so. I enjoyed every minute of reading that book.  BY: LBG 
 My goodness, what is a non-musical person like Holly Mathews doing in this board?  Do you know what other album she has reviewed?  Hayley Westenra!  And she's not even an opera singer!  She obviously doesn't know her business!  Disgraceful review!  Ignore it!  It obviously was not based on good judgement.  I'm sure she is a pop fan who just likes tender music.  Oh, her insulting language!  What an ignorant Maria basher!   Anyway, this is an excellent compilation of SOME of Maria Callas' greatest arias.  Although I do wish some arias like Pace Pace Mio Dio were included here, I do think it is a very good compilation all in all.  Although she has many detractors, they still have to admit that Callas is the sheer embodiment of singing and drama.  She was an actress...a panther on the stage.  Listen to her La Mamma Morta and her Suicidio...those brought chills to my spine when I listened to them.  Maria is the only singer in the history of opera besides the great Caruso-tenor Franco Corelli who touched me, moved me even.  This is probably the reason why I love Maria Callas' music so much.  If you want to hear Medea's anger and Norma's anguish and Butterfly's hopeful blindness, listen to Maria Callas.  If you just want a golden voice, then go to Renata Tebaldi or Joan Sutherland.  And don't even compare her with Charlotte Church or Hayley Westenra!  The distaste of some people 
 Sleepaway Camp 1 is the best movie ever. In the begining it is just something to laugh at but near the end things start speeding up and  the end is a thriller like no other. I didn't go outside at night for weeks.     Sleepaway Camp 2&3 were trash. They were bad Pornos. Kinda fun to make fun of in group.     All three sleepaway camps are enjoyable group movies and should be bought. Keep your eyes out for Sleepaway Camp 5. 
 This book was recommended to me by my management professor.  Through reading it i saw that it was brilliantly written to appeal to both the athlete and the manager.  It is inspirational and intriguing for everyone who will read it.    Coaches and managers will learn how to succeed.  Athletes will be inspired. 
 So these are the words of Calamity Jane, a contender in Roger Corman's low budget farce, "Death Race 2000." It is interesting that Amazon paired Corman's film with Norman Jewison's "Rollerball" and for good reason: one movie is pure satire and played strictly for laughs while the latter is a far more serious and somber commentary on the media, America's love affair with violence steeped in what we call "sport," and the cult of celebrity. Both films explore these themes quite differently, yet both are entertaining as they are disturbing.    As a black comedy, "Death Race 2000" is more or less a cheaply made exploitation flick (budgeted at approximately $300,000), that never pretends for an instant to be anything more than a satire of the future and a parody of "Rollerball"--a far more ambitious, absorbing and expensive film.   Corman's film  depicts a "game"--the Transcontinental Death Race--designed to cater to society's need to channel its aggression and hostile impulses as sort of a 21st century equivalent of the Roman circus offering spectators both entertainment and a catharsis in its more manic and kinetic moments.    Yes, the film is crazy--from the attack on Frankenstein by the French Air Force to Thomasina Paine (hilarious!) and her revolutionaries' thwarted attempts to assassinate "Mr. President" and end the Transcontinental Death Race once and for all. While the special effects in Corman's film are decidedly low-rent, save for some interesting matte paintings injected at the beginning of the film, the cars themselves, customized by car designer James Powers, are both creative and imaginative. The film, for the most part is amusing and very funny. The "Real Don Steele" is terrific as the commentator with one-liners that will leave you laughing.   While Carradine's "Frankenstein" looks utterly ridiculous in a plastic helmet and a vinyl body suit, a pre-Rocky, Sylvester Stallone steals the show and seems far more comfortable in the role of "Machine-Gun Joe Viturbo." Stallone would be a household name a year later with "Rocky" released in 1976. Before he assumed his US Senate seat representing his home state of Iowa, a bespectacled Fred Grandy, preceding his "Love Boat" debut on ABC, also manages some laughs as "Herman the German."     This DVD release with its extras and commentary is a vast improvement over the Digital Multimedia release that looks like it was pirated-off someone's VHS copy recorded in EP mode. For Corman fans, this would appear to be the release to shoot for. And according to IMBD, Corman is presently working on a big budgeted sequel due out sometime in 2008. 
 Mr Bean is the funniest British comedian around.  You will laugh so much when you see this. 
 This is not the type of movie that you can watch while distracted or doing something else.  I went to the show to see this movie and did not get it at all, so I rented it to see what I was missing. At the show, it just seemed like a lot of shooting, a guy trying to deal with his dramatic girlfriend, a trigger happy brother, a family man who's fighting the bad guy lifestyle, and a very confused brother who doesn't know whether he wants to be a rockstar or a gangster.  The four meet to find out who killed their brother and although the other three realize this may be heavier than they thought, there's always that one testosterone heavy guy who think he's Superman.  Mr. Testosterone is the ringleader in many fights, shoot-outs, and all four unite for justice.  This movie is proof of how brother bond, regardless of race, when loyalty comes into play.  I'm definitely glad I gave it a second chance.  Side Note: The soundtrack music is on point.  Classic music by artists like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye play in the background, which makes this modern day western even cooler.  I wish the scene with Angel's character and the bathtub could've been shown in the deleted scenes so I could see whether it looked believable, but I cracked up at the "Bobby teases Jack" scene. I wish that would've been left in the movie to make Bobby's character more human (and hilarious).  My only problem with this movie was Mark Wahlberg saying the n-word. I don't care how much or how long his character is supposed to be from the streets: there are still certain barriers not to be crossed.  Other than that, great movie 
 There is nothing new under the sun and this book originally written in 1850's is a gem.  As an artist I found the book and descriptive language immensly readable (I guess that had to write well as diagrams were incredibly difficult/expensive to include).  A gresat buy at the price 
 Mariachi Cobre has a very soothing sound when it comes to playing boleros and sonnes.  The sound of Randy and Steve's voices singing together is just so beautiful. The way Cobre plays their instruments is so exciting to hear  what they will play next.  During the time between the end of the song to  the beginning of the next one keeps you in suspense.  You are yearning to  hear what is next. I love this cd. Take my advice you will love it 
 Arnold wants a pet and his imagination is off and running.  Arnold's mother guides him gently in the right direction, but not before Arnold comes up with some wildly inappropriate choices.  Steven Kellogg's  illustrations are delicious.  This is one of my children's favorite books.   Now that they are older, they buy this book for every little kid they can  think of.  Don't miss it 
 Black Swan Green was a very insightful novel with honest portrayals of its characters and their situations.  It follows a 13-year-old boy named Jason through one year in his life and shows how he deals with those around him, how they influence him and how he chooses to portray himself to them.  He is a closeted poet, who writes using the pen name Elliot Bolivar and enjoys poetry because it is the best way that he thinks there is to express himself.  While this is a common reason that many people turn to the multi-expressive and multi-meaningfulness of poetry, it is especially important for Jason, because he suffers constantly with his spoken words because he has a stammer.   At first I thought that this book was hard to understand because, being an American, I only speak American English and had a hard time with British slang that make up Jason's everyday vocabulary.  And while this was difficult in the beginning, soon I was speaking his language and understanding words like snogging (kissing) and pongs (smells).  By using these distinct words, Mitchell really pulled me into the mind of a thirteen-year-old British boy to the point where I felt like I knew him completely and was completely shocked when he could do something a little out of character.   Jason is a very likable character from the start because he is the underdog.  He is constantly conscious of his stammer, he takes mental notes of what the `hard' kids say and do, he lives in the shadow of his older sister and he is always trying to live up to what a normal thirteen-year-old boy is supposed to be.  But he is also very smart.  He understands the complex relationships that circle around him, from his pre-divorced parents to the rivalries among the other boys.  He understands the various hierarchies that he lives in and the ways in which other people climb them and fall down them.  With such a comprehensive grasp of his world, it is all the more interesting that he is so clueless about his own role in it and even more importantly who that character is.  So yes, it is a coming of age story, but not just for Jason.  Mitchell uses this book and Jason's coming of age to question whether people really do "come of age," and what the means for every person.  With every chapter comes a new story, but they are all strung together by Jason's hilarious humor, witty commentary, comprehensive insight and honest reactions, which makes this book an awesome choice for anyone who want to be a teenager again and see how really hard it was or is

 ...Peter O'toole got cheated for the first also.  This is simply amazing dialogue, performed with unbelievable energy and pacing. Few movies improve with each viewing, but this is it.  Simply grand.  
 After travelling to the Dominican Republic, my mother bought me this book for Christmas. Of course it's for a younger audience, but none the less I enjoyed it thoroughly! It may be surprising to some, but it is quite an accurate depiction of typical Dominican life in some respects. The desire for the simple things, and the longing for some hope for tomorrow affects so many families in the Dominican. Many issues that plague this country, such as marriage and the family-unit, alcohol consumption, gambling, employment, and economics surround this story. But amongst the struggles, you see the love of a family, finding simple beauties that we as Americans tend to forget. You see into this little girl's heart as you experience the sites and sounds of the Dominican that she SO accurately describes! I can feel, taste and see all that I experienced just by reading this book 
 Great from point A to point Z guide to raising and caring for beef cattle- an easy read with a lot a valuable information.  I would not only recommend this book to someone else in my family looking to start raising cattle- I  would buy it for them myself! -- Mike Jorde 
 This is an impressive, intelligent and compelling book full of sage advice you won't find anywhere else.  It's like having your very own personal CG  mentor walk you through this fascinating and complex field.  Masson keeps  it interesting, interweaving his personal experience and keen insights.  I  found something useful and surprising in every chapter.  I'm recommending  this wonderful book to my friends 
 REALLY GOOD, WITH GOOD & SHARP IMAGE. VERY SATISFIED. VERY FAST SHIPPING. THANK YOU. 
     Andrew Jackson was born to poor Scotch-Irish immigrant mother on March 15, 1767.  Jackson's father, after whom he was named, was killed while working on the new homestead.  Just after Andrew Jackson Sr. was killed Elizabeth moved in with her sister.  "Elizabeth took charge of a large household that now included eleven children" (5).    It was in this large household that Andrew Jackson grew up in.  However, his mother, though she ran the household, was largely treated as a guest.  Elizabeth was a welcome help as her sister was an invalid.   By 1781, during the War for Independence, Jackson's mother passed away.  Two years later, he was only 16 years old he learned he had a small fortune waiting for him in inheritance from his grandfather.  It was not long that the money was gone and he was in debt.  He wondered aimlessly through his young adulthood, bringing shame to his extended family because of his reputation for living fast and being quite the "rake".  Many young ladies' parents believed that "he would get himself killed before he was many years older" (14).  During this time he is described as being "entirely callous to the feelings of others".  This would be an accurate description of Jackson through his entire life.        After a time of stumbling about, he finally landed on trying to practice law and was admitted to practice on the 20th of September 1787 in Wadesborough, North Carolina.  Barely 3 months later the North Carolina State Legislature decided to send judges and advocates over the Appalachians to help settle the frontier dockets.  This was the perfect opportunity in the eager young man's eyes to further himself and to become a true gentleman.  Less than a year after gaining permission to practice law he was insulted by a true gentleman lawyer, Waightstill Avery, "the prominent attorney who had refused to accept Jackson as an apprentice" (16).  He felt slighted and challenged the man to his first duel.  No doubt Jackson enjoyed the sense of honor the duel gave him as he was later involved in several more duels.       This was the birth of Jackson's life as a frontier gentleman.    This was the only kind of gentleman that Jackson was capable of becoming, which in some Easterner's eyes was no gentleman at all, but a mockery of landed aristocracy.  He was not thriving in the East, but taming the West, and the rules of society were different.  He moved through the echelons of society in the growing town of Nashville in middle Tennessee.  Marrying into the prominent, but at the moment desperate Donelson family.        "Jackson entered politics to become a judge; he played politics to become a general" (39).  He was already involved in politics and had gained a bench.  However, it was not long that he pulled the connections he had with Blount, the politician of Tennessee, to become the judge advocate for the militia.   And he eventually gained the rank of major general and remained the leader of the Tennessee militia through the War of 1812.  It was not until the end of the war that Jackson gained his true fame.  He and his men were at New Orleans in January of 1815 and beat the British with a loss of 13 total casualties.  6 dead, 7 wounded.  The British sustained around 1600 dead and wounded.  Jackson is often not given the full credit for the victory, but confusion, fog and other things are also handed the laurel.  At the time however, the nation began singing the praises of their new hero "Old Hickory".   It was a short jump into the Presidency from there where he served two terms and managed to divide the Democratic-Republican party.  He was a man who took things intensely personal.  For example, the issue of nullification.  The issue was whether or not it was the individual State Legislatures that decided the constitutionality of new laws and if they had the power to void them at their borders.  Jackson being essentially a westerner deeply ingrained in a Southern mentality, was a big proponent of state's rights.  This seems like it would have been an issue he would have allowed to go through.  However, his deep sense of "l'estat c'est moi" meant that these states were personally attacking him.  He would never stand for that and killed the issue.        Another example of his taking issues and political maneuvering personally, and his stance on state's rights, was with the Bank.  The National Bank of the United States was a sound financial institution of the day.  However, men like John C. Calhoun (Jackson's one time Vice President), Henry Clay and Daniel Webster were all big supporters of the Bank.  They had committed treason against the person of the President so he would be sure to kill whatever they supported.  He was already determined that the Bank was out to kill him.  So, Jackson hired and fired a company of men to be the Secretary of the Treasury until he found one to be his lackey.  Once the right man was found, Roger B. Tanney, he was able to withdraw all the federal money from the U.S. Bank and put it all into smaller state banks around the country.  In doing so he rendered the Bank financially ruined.  Calhoun and the men of his company were sure to not ratify as many appointments as they could in Jackson's cabinet as to stall any more of his policies from passing.        Curtis aims to portray Jackson as a man searching for vindication.  I find Curtis portraying Jackson as a man simply searching.  Jackson desires respect and respectability more than anything.  During his two terms as the nation's executive he reminds me Orson Wells' famous portrayal of Citizen Kane.  Always looking for appreciation, willing to play both sides of an issue for the pleasure of being right or honorable.  Too often in Jackson's life, as in Kane's, these things were not two sides of the same coin.  Curtis portrays Jackson honestly, and seemingly true to form.  Curtis gets lost often in his own analysis and should stick to the facts, allowing them the room to speak for themselves.  The best example of this is the "psycho-babble" covering Jackson's early life.  Most readers will be able to see the scars Jackson bore, perhaps unwittingly, through his life when the facts are observed plainly, rather than thru Curtis' lingo.   I have come away from reading this book feeling that some questions are not answered.  The portrayal of Jackson's relationship to his enemies seems to be missing some details.  Also, the voice of Jackson himself is largely missing, except when Curtis wants to point out Jackson's delight in sport or his 18th Century penchant for being over dramatic.  At least Curtis shines a mocking limelight on Jackson's "dramatis personae" only to show how his personality thrashed about to show off.  He does this all the while wanting the reader to take into serious consideration how Jackson was deeply affected by the traumatic events in his early life.  I found Curtis to be fair in his attempt to understand a complex and difficult man to appreciate.  I liked Jackson, though I would not like to know him personally.  From a distance I could admire some of his qualities, at close quarters he would loathe me. 	  bl 
 Our class read The Courage of Sarah Noble.  I liked this story for several reasons.  I thought that the book was great because the author described the book very well.  It had many details in the book and many things that happened to Sarah.  I learned some interesting facts.  I learned that you shouldn't judge others based on what you hear about them.  I learned that indians eat with their hands.  The Courage of Sarah Noble is a great book 
 The wonderful folks at Fox Home Video have finally answered our prayers and released this colorful 1977 soap opera on DVD. Based on Sidney Sheldon's bestselling novel, TOSOM is the tale of Noelle Page, a poor-but-beautiful French girl who comes to Paris in 1938 to make her fortune. Enter Larry Douglas, a dashing American pilot who finds her, fools her, and forgets her--leaving her pregnant and heartbroken. She loses the baby, swears to get even with the flyboy, and promptly uses her brains and beauty to become the biggest movie star in France and the mistress of the world's richest Greek shipping magnate (sound familiar?). What follows is her life's obsession--a long-range plan of revenge that leads to murder, scandal, and a shocking finale.  This 3-hour drama is as opulent as they come, filmed on gorgeous locations in at least 4 countries, and everyone is dressed to, umm, kill. The beautiful cast includes Marie-France Pisier (COUSIN/COUSINE, CHANEL SOLITAIRE) as Noelle, John Beck (SLEEPER, ROLLERBALL, and TV's FALCON CREST) as the pilot, and a very young Susan Sarandon (we all know her credits) as the pilot's wife, the eventual pawn in Noelle's murderous scheme. Another plus is Michel Legrand's sweeping musical score (with the composer himself on piano). Not to mention the R-rated sex scenes....  By 1977, romantic tearjerkers like this were already out of date, and TOSOM was a big flop at the box office. But its popularity has endured on TV, where new generations have discovered the sheer pleasure of its overwritten, overwrought, overacted, over-the-top dramatics. If you want to see a great film, go watch CITIZEN KANE or RASHOMON or THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS. But if you're in the mood for trashy fun, this is it. Nothing quite compares to a delicious slice of cheese. Enjoy

 C. S. Lewis uses logic to emphasis the importance of natural law.  He argues for absolute, objective, external morality.  He highlights the dangers of relativism.  He argues that science, taken to its logical conclusion does not give humans victory over nature, but allows humanity's natural urges to control the species' destiny.    I found Lewis' use of logic to be refreshing.  Today's discussions are so regulated by law, culture, and political correctness that we have virtually lost the art of no holds barred debates using pure logic.  Logic has become associated with intolerance, and without our even realizing it.  Having given Lewis kudos for his logic, I question the conclusions at which he arrives.  In 1943 it must have seemed like the world was in a pitched battle for survival and science was the key to it.  If science continued to rule human culture, his logic might carry more weight.  However, I am not sure that Lewis (in this book anyway) foresaw the worldwide decline of atheism (both in percentage and actual numbers), or the rise of New Age Religion and the intermingling of world religions.  Many of his ideas still have an eerie truth about them, but Natural Law (Tao as he calls it) has not been neglected.  It is as central to people's search for truth as it ever was, perhaps even more so.  Tolerance is in vogue today, but relativism is not as strong.  They are not the same.  Nor can Natural Law lose.  IF natural law is not external, but cultural, then it already does not exist.  Lewis' progression IS natural.  IF, however, natural law (or Tao) descibes an intrinsic understanding of morality that comes from an external source (God) it cannot lose.  Humans who fail to recognize the significance lose and the period when morality is temporarily forgotten is nothing more than a momentary blip in time.  A word of warning.  Logic is difficult for people to digest today.  This is a small book, but some may not find it easy.     
  The Bayou, Louisiana.  This documentary is shot with a beautiful black & white photography. The music perfectly matches the tempo and feeling of the story. Lasts only 75 minutes but captures our emotion and interest right from the first scene.   The box of the dvd misleads. It made me expect some kind of social reportage on the impact of oil industry in the pristine  bayou wildlife. On the contrary (but that's for you to check).  The story is basically the life of a young and enchanting kid in the Bayou. His daily occupations, his relation with surrounding nature (its enchants and perils). It provokes an emotion similar to the reading of Huckelberry's adventures.   Again, as in all of Mr. Flaherty's documentaries, it's the sheer beauty of the photography and the wonderful capture of the expression of people's faces, real people, that make the viewing a humanly enriching experience.  I have to recommend, also of Mr. Flaherty, "The Man of Aran" and "Nanook of the North".  
 If I could give a church planter only one book to read it'd be this one.  As a former church planter and now as a Church Planting Strategist, I resonate with what Ed shares in his book.  At last, a book that wrestles with the modernistic formulas of church planting with the postmodern culture that we swim in.  Ed's depth of knowledge is evident and he exposes the reader to a multitude of ways of planting churches.  He's not hooked on one approach whether that be seeker driven, cell groups, house churches, or whatever.  He lays everything out for the reader to process and in assessing their own culture to plant a relevant church (cell, house, etc) 
 Amazing...I'd love to meet the guy who wrote this 
 A celebration of life in music and the music of life ... insightful, passionate and inspirational... for the head, the heart and the soul... borne by agricultural implements, played with musical instruments 
 Twenty-five splendid orchestrations from malefik meistros Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka - they are our musickal guides through Haverghast Mansion, setting the mood for unearthing the terrible ghostly secrets lain hidden within the walls of this gloomy house...   Among these phantasmasonic pieces, contained herein is a cantible entitled "Hand In Hand Again", harking back to 1920 c.e.  written by R. Egan and R. Whiting, as well as guest voices from Lily Lane {Madeline Haverghast}, David Jacobs Greg Ballato, and Mary Kate Douglas as Anastasia Haverghast.   Cover work is masterfully manifest by Keith Parkinson to create a most welcoming Manor amidst the full moon, with a familiar blackredlight glow exuding from within, and inside the booklet, a delightfully arcane photo of the musicians, clad in period attire.  Pounding hearts, echoing voices from the past, strings, organ, piano, sound effects, creeking doors, even the sounds of the night, graces The 13th Hour... another monsterpiece which compliments one's own Haunted House.   Again, Midnight Syndicate produces remarkable atmospheric musick suitable for one's Lair and Ritual Chambre for 'Halloween' all year 'round. A constant pleasure 
 Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine.  The cable I received also charges the phone (VX8300 from Verizon).    
 Mr Coyle has done great justice to his old mentor Robert Beverley HALE with this magnificent book. The lessons are based on Mr Hales teachings on the techniques and thinking of the great master drawers, and not only are  the examples all master works, but innovative use of coloured line overlays  makes sometimes difficult concepts abundantly clear.  The real point of  this book, as with all R.B.Hale books, is that YOU can learn to think in  the same highly visually intelligent way as these greats of the past, and  learn to apply that thinking to your own creations. BRAVO Messrs Hale et  Coyle 
 Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry, especially the "Sonnets from the Portuguese," is beautiful, intelligent, and honest love poetry. Anyone who has experienced the doubts, fears, and transformation of love will recognize the truth of the poet's struggle to trust and to love 
 The book Heaven by Randy Alcorn is a must read for anyone wondering what heaven will really be like.  It uses passages from Genesis to Revelation talking about heaven.  Knowing the theological background of Mr. Alcorn, I have one problem with his book.  He gives no basis for hope concerning infants and small children, up to the moment of reason, for them to get to heaven.  My theological background allows, and even mandates, baptism of infants and small children.  I then have hope based on teachings of Jesus of seeing them in heaven.  Mr. Alcorn can only hope for the sake of hope based on nothing.  It is also a bit repetitive, but he keeps putting new information in each chapter to keep you reading.  The repetition may not be bad as he keeps stressing the key points of being a believer in Jesus.  That being said, this is still the best book I have read concerning what heaven will be like.  I have given this book to many people who are looking for God and need a reason to serve him.  It has given me some insight into questions I have had about the bible since my youth.  Knowing the God I wish to serve, the assumptions made in the book may not even be large enough to describe what heaven will be like.  When you pick this book up, be aware you will not be able read continuously without putting it down for a while to think.  If you are a believer, it will answer or validate many assumptions.  If you don't know if you want to know God, it will give you a reason to continue searching for him.  Have a bible handy, you will want it.  Lee Suring 
 To someone who came along as a teenage boy in the mid-1940's, this CD has the elements of authenticity, even surprise, musical history, highly intense performances, and ways evoking memories of emotional highlights of my Youth. When mediocre orchestra 1st tackled Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" at Smoky Mtn Music Camp we were preparing for Sunday's outdoor Concert. Pianos were played by two friends who've presided Music Dept at Carson-Newman College in East Tennessee. In the Trombone section was a skinny kid with too much hair and too big an ego! When our esteemed conductor began the opening bars the Clarinet Soloist, my close friend Danny Boy slide-up the chromatic scale with fleurish. He later became a NC Doctor! He likely plays clarinet for his own amazement in someone's Dixieland Band!    On this wondrous CD there are historic names like Bernstein, Kostelanez, John Williams and Michael Tilson Thomas, Conductors. Andre Previn, Yo-Yo Ma and Sarah Vaughan as Soloists. I would have a hard time choosing which may be called my favorite! It would depend on the day they are playing in my car... traveling to Columbia Seminary classes or GA Diagnostic Prison for lunch with Chaplain friends! I often sing along with the Rhapsody as I did in 1949 when Oscar Levant soloed with Chattanooga Orch. My very young wife was playing in the first violin section! Still today I am totally wiped out when anyone as intensely romantic as Sarah Vaughan sings "Summertime" or "I Loves You, Porgy!"  Is it not amazingly wondrous that someone could create so much enjoyable music in his short lifetime of 39 years? I never wish to part with this all-time favorite 10-Star Recording!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hoo 
 Dungones and dragons lovers should love this movie. Even though its older and nothing like Lord of the rings. The way they portray the people and the different races in this movie is the way G. Gygax would have you play his races in the DnD game(my opinion). It has its somewhat corny but funny interactions with the characters. As well as the ever present good vs. evil. The actors play there characters well. And Jack Palance's voice in his character fits it perfectly. Could not have gotten a better person for the part 
 Figallo appears to be providing his own model for web community success, which is built on building meaningful relationships... between "you" (the site owner/designer/manager/maintainer) and the people who visit your site, as well as between the site visitors themselves. "Meaningful relationships, far more than size, determine the success of online communities." He provides a lot of practical advice, and it's an easy read. My only complaint is that his WELL experience seems to have biased him toward WELL-like communities...he focuses mostly on the social, relationship-building aspects of web forums, chat and the like, as if everyone looking to build a web community should be striving to create a Salon/Cafe type place 
 This CD is just a little different to stand on its own. Take a clean well balance emotional female singer with great range, add some lite jazz & pop hooks to some unique modal changes, play with mostly guitar or piano backup, & wrap within great sound production. The only thing missing is the lyrics. Sometimes you can guess what the next word will be & some songs come close to Christian Pop Rock because of the subject matter (Is she singing about God, humanity, or a boyfriend/lover in most of the songs?), but don't worry, this CD is way above that style.  Are you tired of all the gloom & doom of modern Pop? Do you want something refreshing? Do you want to smile as you drive down the freeway? Give this CD a spin to clear the air 
 My youngest has battled digestive issues since she started solids.  This book gave me wonderful guidance on how to clear up those problems and help her body/gut heal.  It has made a tremendous difference in her overall health.  While I think her "diet" is good for everyone, it's a little too restrictive for most.  I know I could never stick to a diet this rigid, but I have made a lot of dietary changes myself because of this book.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  Highly recommend reading this book 
 Loading a book with humorous caricatures, myths, and factoids is a risky undertaking. But, the authors have opted to present hard science in simple artistic format and succeeded in rendering it palatable, at least for the segment of readers interested in the mechanics of disease.   The main contribution in the book, beside its educational style, is emphasizing the "waist size" as a reliable index for healthy living. The author advanced their argument through physiological reasoning. They focused on the omental and skin fats and intestinal infection and inflammation in relation to waist size. Thus, the smaller is the waist size, the lesser the inflammation and the depot of fat that hinders health.   The book falls into an introduction, 12 chapters, and three appendices that could be summarized as follows.   Introduction: "You: On a Diet. Work Smarter, Not Harder" introduces the reader to the main idea of the book. That is management of waist size through understanding the biology of eating. It tests the reader's common knowledge through a multiple choice test that targets the various aspects of the history and science of eating   Chapter 1:" The Ideal Body: What Your body Is supposed to Look Like" discusses the interplay of genetics and environment in shaping our physique.   Chapter 2: "Can't Get No satisfaction: the Science of Appetite" describes the rule of the central nervous system in controlling satiety through hormonal feedback from the stomach, intestine, and fat. It simplifies matters through two hormones: Leptin for satisfaction and Ghrelin for hunger.   Chapter 3: "Eater's Digest: How Food travels through Your Body" describes, in an educational style, the journey of food from mouth, tongue, stomach, intestine, colon, to liver, heart, muscles. Its humorous caricatures make it invaluable and entertaining.   Chapter 4: "Gut Check: The Dangerous Battles of Inflammation in Your Belly" describes the first battle of digestion between the body and food intake within the intestine. The outcome of digestion affects the liver, skin, and general health. Its main hostile participants are inflammation and infection. Omental, skin, and liver fat replete from the ingested food. It considers the intestine as the second brain by virtue of its millions of neurons and 95% of whole body serotonin.   Chapter 5: "Taking a fat Chance: How Fat Ruins Your Health" dwells on the omentum fat, described in chapter 4, and extends its effects to arterial narrowing and mechanical hindrance of breathing and mobility. Arterial narrowing deprives the whole body of its health causing cancer, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Omental fat is claimed to be more ominous than subcutaneous fat because the omentum lies on the solid vital organs while the subcutaneous fat is peripheral and remote.   Chapter 6: "Metabolic Motors: Your Body's Hormonal fat Burners" describes how metabolism is managed by hormonal signals from the adrenals, thyroids, and gonads.   Chapter 7: "Make the Move: How You Can Burn Fat Faster" discusses the effect of exercise, weight lifting (strength) and aerobics (stamina) on developing the energy management system by: increasing metabolism, burn energy, release endorphins (pleasure stimulants), and unclog blood vessels.   Chapter 8: "The Chemistry of Emotions: The Connection between Feelings and Food" discusses the relationship between behavior and neurotransmitters: norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid, and nitric oxide. It thus relates eating to emotions such as anger, depression, anxiety, stress, jealousy, and loneliness.   Chapter 9: "Shame on Who? The Psychology of failed Diet" deals with the thought process of dieting versus the action process. It describes three areas of personality tests: eating pattern, exercise pattern, and coping pattern.   Chapter 10: "Make a You-Turn" describes strategies for accomplishing healthy body through eating, exercising, and coping with failure and recovery. It makes the waist size its critical index for success. Here where academic reasoning addresses the universal suffering from distended bellies in contemporary subjects.   Chapter 11: "The You activity Plan: Physical Strategies for Waist Management" is where the authors default. They suggest three-20-minute sessions per week of strengthening and stretching exercises. Those range from shoulder rolling, crossing, clapping, forward bend, push up, yoga poses, crunches, to dumbbell squats, lunges, and rowing. Here, the reader senses the detachment of academics from real advancement in workout experience.   Chapter 12: "The You Diet; The Waist-Management Eating Plan" recommends three meals plus snacks daily and dessert every other day. It prohibits sugars, simple carbohydrates, fructose, trans fat, saturated fat, and flour. It also has extensive menu and advices on how to choose among fast food if you have to.  The forty pages of menu is a total waste, as people do not trust medical books in preparing their meals (personal opinion).   The three appendices deal with drugs, plastic surgery, and digestive surgery for overweight people.   The major drawback in the book is the exercise recommendation and meals menu. Those show the aloofness of the authors from modern America. The web is rich in better ideas on exercise and nutrition that work and get results. The book should have limited its scope to what the authors know best: applied physiology.   Mohamed F. El-Hewie  Author of  Essentials of Weightlifting and Strength Training 
 If you liked 44 Scotland Street, you will also enjoy this next book in McCall Smith's series. All the characters are back and their adventures are more exciting even than the last book's. The one exception is Ramsey Dunbarton's memoirs, which are intended to be so boring they are hilarious but unfortunately hit the mark at boring period. I don't know why McCall Smith kept on and on adding installments to the man's memoirs- it felt like there were a lot of chapters wasted on it that could have been better used on the charming Bertie or Pat.  That said, the book still gets five stars, because except for these few chapters about Ramsey, the book was very enjoyable and moved along at a good pace 
 I really enjoyed paging through this book. It covers everything from flowers to invitations, to dresses to food, etc. She also explains the traditions and goes into depth on how different religions can set up the procession, ceremony, music to play, greeting line, and table seatings, etc.  All of the photos were wonderful and gave me a lot of great ideas for my wedding. Anyone who loves Martha Stewart will love this book, as well as those who are looking to have a beautiful, classy, and elegant wedding. I highly recommend this book 
 One small problem I found is he does use some products that aren't as readily available in the US and in Europe such as Creme Fraiche.  The DVD that comes with the book is excellent and shows and easy and quick these recipes can be 
          Relaxed, funny, but ALWAYS the consumate pro, "Dean Martin Live from Las Vegas" is a previously unreleased gem from the Capitol vaults.  It is classic Dino, great standards seamlessly blended with irreverent humor.  This CD is part of the Las Vegas centennial celebration and features live preformances from Bobby Darin, Frank, and others.  I don't agree with the other reviewers who criticized the mono soundtrack.  This is an essential purchase for all serious Dino afficionados.  Dean is in fine form, and the sound quality is excellent.  Buy it, enjoy it, and realize that you are listening to one of the finest vocalists of all time.   
 I love it!  I am a very proud "lactivist" with a beautiful healthy 13 month old moo.  This book is really a breath of fresh air, with some really thought provoking ideas.  Since our culture almost let breastfeeding become a "lost art", I think that we really need ideas like those from Fiona Giles that blast open people's ideas of what breastfeeding is and can be. I've already started asking other nursing mothers some of the questions posed in the book.   This has really started me thinking about things in a whole new light 
 Mark Rothko wanted the viewer of his work to engage in the metaphysical. Yes, his paintings are beautiful colour works, yet the impact on ones pysche is where Rothko wanted to communicate. Colour was his tool. Philosophically he was a profound man and this book has given great insight into how relevant [important] Rothko is to annals of Art History.  When an artist expresses the spiritual, emotional, academic, through colour and the scale of the painting, he engages the viewer on so many levels. This book gives insights, and is a worthwhile acquistion to the understanding of the man, Rothko 
 Great illustrations and a fun story for both the reader and child.  Having read this to my son (now 19) since he was a pre-schooler, I can tell you from experience that this one will be a well worn classic at your house.  Get ready to read it 5 times a day 
 Excellent book, if the other book, Barns: Living in Converted and Reinvented Spaces is the ying, then this book is the yang. A good inspirational design book if you're interested in reusing an old barn for modern day use and staying within the original design. The text is interesting and informative with the accompanying photos following along with the text. The pictures are overall excellent, sharp, clear, in detail and professionally done, with very very few exceptions. Some buildings are shown with structural  drawings that help visualize the internal timber frame or stone structure with the accompanying photogaphs. The authors seems to be a die hard traditionalist, very critical and at times mildly insulting to designers that chose to remodel the old barns in the modern way and deviating from what the original builders did. But at times understanding that the modern style  is a better fate than total destruction of a old old structure.  
 For those who know "The Guns of Navarone" only from the justly famous movie starring Gregory Peck and David Niven, Alistair MacLean's novel will be an enjoyable surprise.  "Navarone" is, with "Where Eagles Dare", the Scottish-born MacLean's best known work in the United States.  His story of a daring British commando raid against the fictional German-held island of Navarone is loosely based on a failed British expedition to the eastern Aegean Sea during the Second World War.  The commandos must silence the guns of the title to permit the evacuation by sea of British troops trapped on a nearby island.  The novel traces the commandos' dangerous journey by sea to Navarone and their struggles to survive and outwit the Nazi occupation force long enough to carry out their mission.  A strength of this novel is MacLean's portrayal of well-developed and nuanced characters.  Captain Mallory, a New Zealander and pre-war mountain climber, is the leader; his deputy is Andrea, a taciturn and dangerous, yet compassionate Greek.  Others are Miller, the cynical and world-weary American explosives expert, and young Stevenson, the insecure subaltern and backup climber.  We are given enough of the background and voice of each of the major characters to understand why they are the way they are.  MacLean took care to populate the story with an interesting supporting cast of British and German military personnel and Greek villagers.  In the process, he conveys a sense of the desperately bitter partisan warfare that must have taken place in Nazi-occupied Greece.  A second strength is MacLean's ability to weave a complicated yet compelling story.  The opening chapter sets the tone with almost brilliantly concise description and dialogue.  Mallory, obstensibly spirited out from a behind the lines mission in Crete for a rest, discovers that his boss has a more important mission for him.  Mallory's hastily put-together team must surmount a series of hair-raising challenges and make some tough choices along the way.  In precise, often understated prose, we experience with the commandos the physical and mental fatigue of a dangerous and morally ambiguous mission.  MacLean vividly portrays a harsh world of war and betrayal, in which even the best choices have brutal consequences.  This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for an enthralling adventure story, one told with style and substance.  This is no mindless summer beach read.  "The Guns of Navarone" is MacLean at his best, a pure pleasure to read.   
 To be able to enjoy the suspense of the novel and to follow along with the wonderful illustrations was fantastic; it gave me a whole new love for one of the best books I have ever read.  This will be one of the most treasured books of my collection! 
 In Frank And Jesse James: The Story Behind The Legend, biographer Ted Yeatman draws upon more than twenty-five years of meticulous research to provide readers with fresh and revealing insights into the lives and events of the famous (or infamous) bandit brothers. Yeatman researched the archives of eight states and uncovered previously unpublished material in the National Archives. The result is a comprehensive detailing of the brothers modest upbringing, their harrowing experiences during the Civil War, their sixteen-year post-war notoriety, and the lives of those who outlived the assassinated Jesse, as well as those who subsequently attempted to impersonate him. Frank And Jesse James is a fascinating biography and "must" reading for all American history buffs and western frontier enthusiasts 
 Duchamp was not an artist, but an alchemist. As a teen I had the opportunity to see Arturo Shwarz give a lecture on Duchamp, called "archetypal alchemical iconography & the work of Marcel Duchamp". Though much of what he said was lost on me, the bits I could make out spoke directly to my soul. A favorite artist of mine thus took on a far greater significance in my estimation, & the way I looked at life was never quite the same. This has got to be the definative work on Duchamp, from a man who was both his greatest protagonist,& a close personal friend. Shwarz was a great documenter of the 20th century avant-garde, & i feel very lucky to have known him 
 With the high price of textbooks these days this little gem is a fantastic buy. The book is thick-think of getting both volumes of Cohen-Tannoudji wrapped into one. It begins with the standard review of "old" quantum theory, carefully explaining the photoelectric effect and all that. The presentation is nice, detailed, and physically insightful. It also includes things like the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules that might get left behind in modern treatments. After this he has an excellent chapter on "matter waves and the Schrodinger equation", with an excellent discussion of wave packets and quanitzation of atomic energy levels. I found this chapter alone made purchasing the book worthwhile. The rest of the book goes into the formal development of quantum theory and studies central potentials, scattering, the harmonic oscillator, angular momentum and all that. At $19 bucks you can't go wrong buying this book. 
 I have really enjoyed this CD.  The music is heavenly and her voice is lovely to listen to 
 Because there is no evidence to prove either way. The fact that 2 long prison sentences were still the result of all this is shocking. If I were innocent of a crime I did not commit (especially one as horrible as this), I would NEVER give in and plead guilty just to bargain with the judge. I have no respect for Jesse Friedman in this regard.  Let me make it clearer. Andrew Jarecki was just making a documentary about New York Clowns when he met David Friedman, the best party clown in New York. David told him of his past and provided Jarecki with hundreds of reels of family home-movie footage. The Friedmans captured every moment of their lives on film it would seem. The story that unfolded in these films was something Jarecki could never even dream of.  Arnold Friedman was a troubled man. After the death of his 9-year-old big sister his father left and the family was torn apart. His mother moved into a tiny apartment with him and his brother and all three of them shared a room. The mother would bring back male partners and shag them in full view/earshot of her sons. Wouldn't that disturb you? But it gets even worse. He was a merry man, slightly camp and married a woman who was as about as sexually responsive to him as a blow-up doll. They may have had three sons and lived a 'happy' existence as an upper-middle class Jewish family in a well-to-do part of the state, but underneath it all Arnold was hiding a secret. He was a huge paedophile and he liked really young boys.  He would order kiddie fiddling mags from Europe, but one of them was seized by customs and he was investigated. Arnold also taught computer class and the cops made a list of all the names of the kids he taught and made a point of interviewing them with some truly dodgy, unclear, unprofessional techniques.  Many of the kids said that Arnold and his oldest son Jesse had been sexually abusing them. And not a simple one-at-a-time deal either. Apparently they had made them all strip naked in class and play a horrible game called 'leap frog' in which each and everyone of them would quickly and systematically be anally raped. Is this disgusting? Of course it is? Do I believe it? No! There is no way that this could have continued for as long as it did without someone noticing. Other kids in the same class said nothing like it ever occurred. And if it did then where is the evidence? Without meaning to sound crude, anal sex is a pretty difficult thing to get right as an adult. For terrified, unwilling children who are being mass-raped where was the tissue damage, the blood, the tears, the agony and the reluctance to ever go back to Mr Friedman's class? Even for adults it's not simply like sticking a hot dog through a donut. This whole allegation that they did anal-rape as a game of leap frog is absurd and totally far-fetched.  Did Arnold Friedman have wicked thoughts about his students? Probably. Did he involve his then 18-year-old son? Hmmm, I'm not sure about that one. Let me just say that the Friedman household is one I am glad I am not part of. There always seems to be an atmosphere of unnaturalness or 'something ain't quite right here' about it. Jesse Friedman says that his dad never hurt him. Jesse Friedman's Defence Attoney says otherwise.  This is a particular trick Jarecki uses to show the conflicting sides of the story. One person says black and immediately another person says white. The documentary is nothing but contradicting stories and polar opposites. While I do not believe the entire innocence of Arnold Friedman (the man clearly WAS a paedophile), I do NOT believe the word of the Cops, the FBI or any other authority interviewed.  The Judge, one Abbey Boklan, said she was sure of Arnold Friedman's guilt the second she saw him. In my view, she's openly admitting to Gross Professional Misconuct. How dare she, a judge, a stern, responsible authority figure, make such an outrageous, unfounded remark without hearing ANY kind of evidence first.  And like I said, there IS no evidence. Only the claims of the children. Nothing in this case was based on evidence because evidence didn't exist. Doesn't that strike you as being really, really odd? The Cops claimed that hypnosis was used to get answers out of the kids. As well as pressure from the parents (oblivious to the fact that their kids are undamaged physically) to tell the proverbial awful truth and encouraging embellishment of perhaps slight truths and instances to the point where this whole ridiculous leap frog game is created.  The trial is not the only focus of the film. The complete and utter breakdown of the family is also caught on camera. The sons hate their mother with a passion at her refusal to stand by her man. I can understand their anger, but what woman would? She had no evidence to persuade her either way, but she always found an unnaturalness to Arnold and the allegations probably confirmed her fears I guess.  Arnold killed himself in prison in 1995 so Jesse, also imprisoned for 13 years despite no evidence, could benefit from the $250, 000 insurance policy. Mrs Friedman re-married but the family name is stained forever in my opinion. So too should be the word of all the unprofessional authorities and lawyers involved.  No one in this documentary comes away without tarnish. It's a sick, sad and sorry story that will confuse as much as it enlightens. Make up your own mind 
 Crazy Itch Radio's cover art has pretty much the same color scheme as its predecessor, Kish Kash, and similarly, the music is cut from the same mold. If you know the Jaxx, you know the score: the infectious dance beats, the bombastic synthesizers, the zany blips and samples, the catchy radio-friendly lyrics sung over a bed of wild howls and yelps. In short, a party record.  Four albums on, Basement Jaxx has really established a unique and immediately recognizable style that few have been able to properly duplicate or imitate. Yet there is a mild sense of "been there done that" to this record. It doesn't really go anywhere that the Jaxx haven't been before. Remedy and Rooty had more radio-friendly singles, Kish Kash was more bizarrely eclectic. But this is nevertheless a solid release. Hush Boy is the most poppish, Everybody the most danceable, On the Train the most soulful, Run 4 Cover the most, well, Basement Jaxxy. And the slower numbers near the end, like the silky Lights Go Down and the bonus track, have more subtlety than on the other records. But there are no real weak points.  Furthermore, a cursory glance at the lyrics suggests that this is, however vaguely, a concept album. While that seems completely counterintuitive for a band as ADHD as Basement Jaxx, the songs do appear to chronicle the ups and downs of a single drunken relationship (although each stands alone, also). Of course, then there's that Run 4 Cover song. I don't know what that one's about 
 This guy knocks my socks off.  Read him just for pleasure and learn loads while your at it.  I find this truly fascinating.  
 I really loved this book because it prepared me for everything. The only thing that would have made it 5 stars is if it was a longer book. It hits every topic I could think of 
 I liked the book. It's very simple, quite organised. I belive it has about 23 chapters. Starts with velocity, speed, gravity, weight, then goes to more advanced areas for example waves, particles, etc. Sometimes it gives the background of a discovery. Newton liked to make people sad, I think I remember. It has the regular Einstein is the greatest mind of all times. I think it tries to explain the E=MC2 that everybody knows and few understand it.  It's pretty simple. Stripped out of all formulas but the most useful ones. I really liked the beginning of the book, dealing with gravity. For example, there is no such thing as Zero gravity. The cosmonauts are acutally in microgravity because they fall with the ship, and the ship falls continously in a straight line towards earth, but as it falls it spirals around the earth because of gravity, which makes it miss the target and be kept orbiting around the earth. There is not one place in space where there is no gravity.  What I like about this book is the way it teaches the reader. It continously asks questions. Why this, why that, and you have to figure it out yourself. Although it does give brief introductory substance, but what you have the job to expand it. Luckily, all the answers are right beneath wihch is very annoying. Somtimes I see the answer before, and now the question is useless. I had to cover the answers before reading the questions.  But I belive there is an equal amount of literature and formulas. You won't learn math from this book, but the general idea. I gave it 5 starts because it is what the title says: self-teaching, and basic 
 ... I have found this book is such an amazing one. Doctor McGinnis is such a wonderful psychiatrist. Listenning to his audiobooks made me feel delighted, more positive about my life and everything around me. I just wanted to say "Thanks" to him. I have learned much from it. Everything that he mentioned and taught was not only for depressed individuals but for the optimistic persons as well. I hope he could continue to write books and have more audiobooks available for all of us 
 For those who grew up watching the "American Pie" movies, the "La Boum" films must seem silly, harmless and bland.  If you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes, don't bother with this movie.  If you want some harmless family fun and some conversational French practice - rent or buy "La Boum" 
 Just finished the fourth of this magical saga of adventures and I cannot wait to purchase the next couple of tomes! Once again suspense crawls with a slow and patient pace, characters are resuscitated from Velázquez's canvases, the narrative borrows conspicuously Cervantine sketches, and the action episodes sprawl spontaneously with diminutely described fencing and brawling scenes. Do Pérez-Reverte's books get published in English? Such Spielbergesque epic is worth its circulation in one too many a tongue 
 Finally an investment book that shows the novice how to do the fundamental things necessary for intelligent investing.  Even if you are not a believer in Bill O'Neill's philosophy, the chart reading tools and common-sense tips will help anyone who invests.  My only complaint is that I think the chart reading chapter and some of the chapters dealing with the fundamentals should be first instead of later in the book 
 His music is tasteful, diverse and technically advanced. This is another great Ford CD. Don't miss it 
 Phil Tucker's magnum opus, "Robot Monster", ranks among the best bad movies ever made.  The plot is incoherent, the acting ranges from bad to awful and the eponymous "Robot Monster" is a guy in a gorilla suit with a tin foil covered diving helmet who communicates with his home planet using a bubble machine. Originally released in 3-D, this DVD uses a good 2-D print and the transfer is pretty good. This is a "must have" for fans of bad movies 
 Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.   Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.   Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.   Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed 
 This DVD is focused explisitedly on the ocean where no one has been before to film beautiful creatures of the deep.The IMAX effect though is somewhat lost because of TV size. The film seemed short to me ,although well done. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a good job narrating but in end is message to save our seas , which makes more a documentary than entertaining film 
 We've seen several versions of Cinderella now and like this one the best. When my kids were smaller they liked the Disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the Disney version out the window. I personally really liked the Julie Andrews B & W version due to the GREAT singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the DVD plays 
 A Wrinkle in Time is a delightful science fiction, fantasy novel that revolves around three main characters:  Meg Murry, Calvin, and Charles.  Meg is a twelve-year old girl who doesn't think much of herself and does poor in school except in the areas of math and science. Calvin is a bright fourteen-year old teenage boy who is very popular at school and is great at sports.  Charles is Meg's five-year old brother who most people think is stupid but Charles has extraordinary powers to know what others are thinking in their minds.  Throughout the story, the children travel through time and distant planets facing good and evil to try to rescue their father who has been captured and held prisoner by an evil force named "It" on a planet called Camazotz. "It" is a creature described as being a living brain without a body that can control all of ones thoughts and actions. It is finally through the power of love that Meg destroys the creature and saves her father. 	I feel this novel was not only influential to me, but many of us could also relate to the character Meg. Meg believed that she was neither smart nor pretty and what she finds out through the wrinkle is that she knows more than she thinks Meg just needs to have more confidence in herself.  Before I read this novel, I really didn't think it would be interesting or exciting in anyway. The only reason why I read it was because my teacher wanted me to; however, at the end of reading this novel my opinion changed and I thought it was a really interesting with many details. 	A Wrinkle In Time shows that all people have to perserver to get though those hard times. Depending on whether your scared or something's to difficult, you always need to break through those challenges. Lastly, love conquers all things. 	What I have gained from reading this novel is that I should never give up and always do my best. I believe that this novel has helped me gain confidence in myself and to realize that I am smart and I can do it. . It showed me that there's always going to be a bump in the road and I just have to have the endurance to get over it.  
 What's silly about it? I love this movie. Richard Tyson may not have a pretty boy face, but his body is pretty darn sexy! That's enough for me! Just too bad they can't show more of him.  Anyway, Sheryl is beautiful and sexy as well which makes for great sex scenes. Women, if you like what you see on the cover (Richard Tyson, Sheryl) buy it. It's softcore, but still good. One thing I thought might of been great was the cowgirl chick and Sheryl together with Richard. Heh...kinky me 
 Dr. Marc Siegel's book delivers what has been sorely missing in the discussion of bird flu--a balanced, reasonable, and objective view of this possible threat to our health. Dr. Siegel carefully explains that calls for alarm are not appropriate based on current scientific knowledge and only serve to raise the fear level. At the same time he outlines steps such as upgrading vaccine manufacture and government responsiveness in case a real threat materializes. His basic advice which is to eat smart, exercise, and reduce anxiety, will likely help all of us to live longer. This highly readable and informative book is really "everything you need to know" about this subject 
 i first heard the poem read on the TV special with Oprah honouring the legends and the youngun's, in the African American world. Regardless of me not being African American, the poem touched me deeply and reminded me of the many women that have touched my life. this little book is definitly a keeper!  Thank you for sharing it with all of us that really do walk in the footprints of so many that have paved the way for us in this world 
 This book has given me a more in depth look into events of Joseph Smith's life before and after being a prophet of God.  Very knowledgeable info 
 This book is so beautifully and creatively illustrated!  The story is meaningful and touching and has a moral important to remember for children and adults.  It's a treasure 
 This book was the first "historical romance" I have ever read.  One I got started, I could not put it down!  Stayed up until 4:00am just so I could see how it ended.  V.H. wrote this book with such a passion between Summer and Ruark that it jumped off the pages.  Since this book I have read several historical romances and most have been fluffy and predictable.  The Pirate and the Pagan has much more substance and less predictability.  If you plan to read this book, do not read through all the reviews; too many people gave away too much good info that really makes the story.  
 This book is amazing! Now it ranks as one of my favorite books to have ever read.  It's so well known that I'll skip summarizing it and speak instead about what I liked. I found the writing style to be smooth and enticing, inviting the reader into the quickened pace of the story. It fed well into the tense, adventurous moments. And the story flowed with the feel of one excellent campaign.   Each of the characters are remarkable in their own right, however three eased their way into making them my favorites of the book:   The Old Mage - The delicate ease at which he starts the companions off on their adventure I found to be highly amusing. His bubbling "accidents" are fun to see, as are the ways the other characters react to him. Yes, this old mage is one amazing character.  Tasslehoff Burrfoot - Tas is a kender, a race that doesn't know fear, so when one says that he's feeling uneasy, you know you are in it deep. He has a habit of "acquiring" things from rings to string and everything in between -- and when questioned about them always declares, "It's lucky I found it. You must have dropped it along the way." I love his childlike mannerisms, the bright outlook on life, and the overall fun of the adventure. Yep, he too is just an all around great character!  Sturm Brightblade - He is the honorable knight with a deep and sad history. A lot weighs on his mind and can be seen in his expressions. I've never read a story before with a knight in it that follows the code of honor so that is what speaks to me about him. He is a dignified and rich character, whose mannerisms of chivalry make me smile. Indeed, a regal character 
 Ralph Nader never took on a big corporation even remotely as evil as the Krupp company was during World War Two.  Germany's leading arms manufacturer used slave labor to keep the nation's armies supplied, and  didn't particularly care whether the slaves lived or died.  The conditions  were atrocious.  If a worker died on the factory floor, the body was  carried out and another slave put in its place.  They were starved, beaten  and ultimately had no hope of survival short of Germany's defeat.  The most  surprising thing is that Alfred Krupp, the President of the company during  this period, was not only released a mere three years after his conviction  at Nuremburg, but given his fortune and company back!  This has to rate as  one of the worst miscarriages of justice that occurred because of the Cold  War.  Manchester's book is lengthy, but very readble.  Overall, it shows  the profit motive at its most reprehensible 
 Nursing Against the Odds: How Health Care Cost Cutting, Media Stereotypes, and Medical Hubris Undermine Nurses and Patient Care (Suzanne Gordon, ILR/Cornell University Press)is a first rate work of journalism, the beginning of a civilian audit that should have been documented by the profession itself, either in its primary practice venue (hospitals) or by its primary proponents of its own value (academics and the American Nurses Association).   Nursing Against the Odds documents not only the manipulation of nursing by the hospital industry, the medical profession and the media (reinforced by drug and device manufacturer Johnson & Johnson). It documents that nurses themselves think so little of their own contribution that they are unable or afraid to speak up when given the chance.  Nursing Against the Odds also documents the real tragedy of the hospital reengineering movement of the 1990s. This response to the challenge to health providers by the Managed Care companies to show their value in the marketplace was the wrong tactic at the wrong time by the wrong people. Michael Hammer and James Champy made a point to warn (in Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution, 1993) that the chief financial officer should never be tasked to manage the reengineering effort, simply because it was not about cutting costs but raising quality. Since the big accounting firms had the ear of the hospital CFOs this is exactly what happened. So the same folks that brought us Enron messed up hospitals and nursing so thoroughly that neither has yet to recover.   The contribution of Nursing Academia and the American Nurses Association during this cascading iatrogenesis has been less than helpful. Nursing schools teach care planning using a methodology that is largely an intellectual fraud. The Nursing Diagnosis Model demands so many mental gyrations that most students don't get it by the time they graduate. Nursing documentation in the clinical record using this method invites ridicule by other health professionals. Consequently Nursing Diagnosis does not inspire care planning and assist in documenting progress. Nursing care plan documentation is simply ignored or mindless phrases show up in clinical documents ("buffing the chart") that no one reads. Nursing Diagnosis phrases like "situational low self-esteem" or "ineffective coping" are more descriptive of Nursing's present state of affairs and its inability to assert itself as an independent profession.  While many academics look down their noses at union membership by calling it unprofessional, they forget that most professions bill for their time in fractions of an hour and produce quantifiable outcomes for their work. (Not many nursing graduates recognize the SF-36 or the FIM, common health outcome measurements tools.) Most professionals have figured out ways to protect themselves and their families, either by bargaining units or individual, enforceable contracts that protect against the hazards of their work or the vicissitudes of their employer. The fact that Nursing is unable to protect itself, and that this leaves anyone who is subjected to a hospital stay in grave danger, should be enough to give us all some motivation to put Nursing Against the Odds at the top of everyone's reading list.

 Do you like music that makes you happy?  I don't mean moderately happy, 7.5 on a scale of 10, isn't it a great day happy, kind of sort of happy.  I mean ecstatic, get up and dance happy, throw caution to the winds and kiss a stranger happy, pump up the volume and wake your neighbors happy, see yourself realizing all your dreams happy.  That happiness is commercially available. It's even legal. You can get a preview of it by jumping on the video of "La Realite" (below). You can just trust me that this is a CD you absolutely cannot go on living without and click and have these sounds for your very own in a matter of days. Or, if you are weary of hype, you can resist until I Make the Case.  Okay, here's the case:  Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia are from Mali. They met in the 1970s, married in 1980 and started performing together. Like their fellow musicians from Mali --- I'm thinking of Ali Farka Toure and Boubacar Traore --- they started with their country's version of the blues. Along the way, they went international and borrowed from cultures as diverse as Cuba and France. And they became very popular indeed.  Small fact: They're blind. Both of them. And possessed of the unusual joy that is the special province of some of the unsighted (see Jacques Lusseyran's jaw-dropping World War II memoir, And There Was Light).  In 2003, Amadou and Mariam hooked up with Manu Chao. This is major, for Chao is a world music god everywhere but in America. The reason for that is somewhat predictable: Chao is unabashedly political. Many of his lyrics are about poverty and oppression, his music is based on local folk music, and underneath it is usually a bouncy punk beat. (In 1994, he bought a train in Colombia, assembled a traveling circus and traveled the country, stopping in villages to perform. "People coming to the show, they all had a gun," he has recalled. "But we went through with no problem. That was our little victory.")  Chao not only produced "Dimanche a Bamako," he co-authored some of the songs, and sang and played guitar as well. But it's as a producer that he shines brightest. Almost every song has a killer beat, and on top of that he layers street sounds, harmonies from anywhere (this CD starts with a cross between 1960s hootenany and 1950s doo-wop), and on top of all that are Amadou and Mariam, who would be offended if they were ever described as less than "hypnotic."  "Dimanche à Bamako" was a huge hit in France, where it won a Les Victoires de la Musique award (the French Grammy). Just from "La Realite" --- the song I'm playing over and over --- I can understand why. The music has police whistles, xylophone, sirens, cheering crowds, a Tex-Mex organ and a beat that pounds disco right through the wall into reggae's yard. And the lyrics (in French) have a brilliantly calibrated mix of rebel politics, weary philosophy and, finally, a command to get out of the chair:  Ups and downs It is life in this world Sad reality While some are being born Others are dying And while some are laughing others are crying  Ups and downs It is life in this world Sad reality Some have work while others are out of work  Then it must be that while some are sleeping Others are keeping the watch It is the sad reality But...let us dance together  Exciting? Thrilling? As the distinguished English critic Charlie Gillett has written, "There are going to be many people who will find they have three copies of this album by the end of this year: one that they bought themselves, the other two given by people who'll say 'I heard this and thought this is the kind of thing you like.' And there will be people who will themselves have bought three or four copies to give to friends, saying, 'I know you've sworn you'll never like an album not in English, but this is the one to win you over.'"  I'll say it more bluntly: This is pure joy, suitable for every occasion. To turn away from "Dimanche a Bamako" is to choose to live a diminished life. I beg you: Don't miss this one 
 For a basic money management software, this product met my expectations.  No frills but very easy to use.  Convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction.  I set my account up in 20 minutes.  There isn't a manual but for the price and ease of use, I don't need one 
 As is true with his other writings, there are places where I totally disagree with Dr. Campolo in this book. Having said that I can say I am in agreement with the primary thesis of this book. He encourages the reader to risk more, try more, do more, love more, live more. Risk-taking and reflection are at the heart of what he is proposing. A self-sacrificing individual who gives to other people will find "fun" in living, not the one who lives to please self. It seems to me his proposition to live big, think big, take risks and love is right in keeping with the way Jesus taught 
 Who would have thought that Callas, who had the great voice for Verdi, Bellini, Rossini, Donizetti, Spontini, Cherubini, Bizet, Giordano, Gluck, Massenet, Haydn (yes, she performed a world premiere for a long forgotten opera called Orfeo ed Euridice), great Puccini roles, and Wagner, would have succeeded at an AMAZING Mimi, a frail role associated with light sopranos who play around with the character.  From her very first breath to the last utterance by the flower girl in her death scene, no other soprano could have bettered Callas in both voice and dramatization in this indelible recording of Puccini's favorite opera (ask around, it's not Madama Butterfly).  Of course, since Maria Anna Sophia Cecilia Kalegoropoulos was born a natural tragedienne, she was undoubtedly going to succeed in this role.  This is one of the many reasons, possibly the most important reason, why this Boheme should not be overlooked.  Then there is Giuseppe di Stefano, the passionate Italian tenor who sings Rodolfo like no one ever did or ever will.  He sang it with an ardour which would leave one in tears.  He is the ideal Rodolfo voice, with his ability to color phrases with shades and tones of passion and love and hate and anger.  In this aspect, he was almost Callas' equal.  He doesn't sing it like Pavarotti, who I believe sings Rodolfo like a cow being dragged into the slaughterhouse.  Pavarotti screams too many of his high notes, and he only became world famous for his nine high C's in the Pour Mon Ame aria from Donizetti's La Fille du Regiment.  He fails however, in darker composer works like Puccini and Verdi.  He should have stayed in the bel canto repertoire where he could have done more wonders with his voice.  Then there the HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT and FIERY Anna Moffo as the controversial Musetta.  How fortunate we are to have this first-rate prima donna in this recording side-by-side with Callas and di Stefano.  And Rolando Panerai...stellar cast!  Not a recording to miss.  
 He spends hours of his day playing with the firetruck.  It was worth the money.  Gives me a couple hours of sanity everyday!!!  Angie  Hac 
 How many times in your life you expect something to be great,  and later find out that it is actually even better than what you've expected? Reading this book, for me, was one of those times. I think that in order to expertise in something you have to gain strong knowledge of the basics.  Itzik Ben-Gan lays for you the foundations to build your SQL expertise. From the first chapter in which Itzik describes the Logical Query Processing Phases through the second chapter, in which Lubor Kollar explains about the Physical Query Processing and through the rest of the book where Itzik doesn't just give you SQL code the works in real life (and it works, believe me I tried), but also explains to you why and how you get the results.  Even tough it is not stated on the book cover you also get best solutions for SQL 2000 in addition to best solutions for SQL 2005 for almost every subject that is presented in the book.  Another bonus that I found is a description of the Tuning Methodology that was developed by Solid Quality Learning. Even tough the explanations are very clear, in my opinion, don't expect everything to be obvious at first read. Some of the things require a deeper thinking. I think this book is much more than just a help to improve your SQL code. This book shows the beauty of SQL.  
 I have read many books on starting your own business by successful CEO's. Most end up to be ego filled babblings, but this is one of the most amazing, useful books I have ever come across. It is insightful, honest, and filled with plain common sense. I refer to it now as my Business Bible. You cannot go wrong following brilliant advice from someone who has proven herself time and time again 
 I used various different books in preparing for the nclex rn, but none of the books I used were as helpful as this one.  This book focused more on the types of questions posed on the nclex.  I would recomend this book to anyone because it made learning and reviewing easy to understand, interesting, and extremely helpful 
 When I got this book, I needed a manual that described the effects of embalming techniques. This book is loaded with diagrams to guide the physician along the way. Please don't miss the chapter on the holistic  benefits of psycho-pyramidology 
 I manage a distributor sales force throughout the U.S. and Canada.  After reading this book (actually WHILE reading this book) I applied the information and witnessed immediate success, as did my sales reps.  The  information is direct, common sense, well presented, easy reading and  entertaining.  It is not full of 'theory', but actual 'meat' that can be  applied each day after reading even a chapter or two the night before.  I  am buying books for each of my reps and feel it is one of the best gifts I  could ever give them.  Well done 
 Eating what you find in the wild can be a life saver.  Learn about plants, not just N. American, but any place in the world that you might be called to serve 
 Deep within the streets of Harlem, New York, a young man named Steve Harmon goes on a journey in the rear of a New York City police car to his future home for least the next 25 years of his life. If worst came to worst, he will spemd possibly the rest of his life in this place: Cell Block D, Manhattan Detention Center. Steve is in this car because of his appearance in a robbery which turned into a homicide. But underneath his hard outer shell, is there a soft side of him beneath all the crime corruption and misfortune of his life. Will Steve be able to deal with doing time in the joint? You have to read Monster to find out Monster by Walter Dean Meyers is a realistic fiction story told in 2 separate ways: the diary of Steve and as a screen play, directed by Steve. In this unique terrific style of writing, it included cast and credits. These features really help you understand the book to the best of your ability. If you couldn't remember something about one of the characters you could always check page 10 which showed you the full cast. For example: "James King as the Thug."  I would recommend this book to any young reader who loves realistic fiction books about teenagers who have many problems in their lives. If you have ever read the book Shooter by Walter Dean Meyers or any other Walter Dean Meyers book you would love this because of its unique format and great language. Also, if you enjoy reading this, you would love all of other books written Walter Dean Meyers.  
 The book Breaking Clean is about the author and her life growning up in a small town of Malta, Montana. She describes her life growing up on farm from a little child in to a grown woman. She tells about how her family wants whats best for her and whats her to keep the family tradition alive by marrying the neigbors son who is 12 years older than her. But she wants more than to be living on a farm for the rest of her life. I thought this book was really good because i can make lots of connections to it from where i am from. But over all it is a good book 
 The 3D ABS workout DVD is truly an alternative way of exercising and it works. I bought this DVD recently from Amazon.com, because I injured my back while doing sit ups and I was looking to find an alternative way of training without straining my back. The exercises may seem simple at first, but they require concentration and are demanding on body's endurance. If you need an aerobic workout that will also tone your abs, look no further!  My only criticism of the DVD is that the production is a bit amateurish, largely because the instructor goes through the initial exercise routines very quickly with the excitement and impatience of a small kid. 
 This new series introduces us to a new lead character and focuses on the eastern section of the Midkemia world.  While the theme has been done before(lone survivor of the massacre of his people, swears vengeance), Feist gives you many twists and turns that make this much more than a revenge story.  As Tal is groomed for things he can't even imagine, dark forces are at work in the world, and the conclave of shadows does all it can to thrawt them.  A brief appearance by Pug helps tie things together.  With Feist, this is just the beginning.  The story will continue to unfold in layers in the final two books which I will eagerly pick up 
 I have very little to add to what the other reviewers have already said.  If you're a fan of Gene Colan, this book is a must-have.  Even if you're not a big Colan fan, you'll learn a lot about the business of comics and how personalities and personal relationships affected the comics we grew up with.  It's well written, well documented and contains a tremendous amount of research and (of course) lots of great art.  (And if the author happens to read this, that very first New York comic convention was the SCARP Con in 1968 -- I, a geeky 17 year old, attended and met the gracious Mr. Colan who did a sketch of Iron Man for me, and drew dozens of sketches for other fans.) Highly recommended 
 This is a fine collection of down-home poetry. I recommend this work to everyone who enjoys reading poetry but does not enjoy deciphering it to find hidden meanings. Most of the poems recount fond memories of childhood  and everyday family life. They are sentimental, optimistic and at times  spiritual. The entire collection is easy to read and very enjoyable 
 It's always a shame when someone of the stature of Mr. Palmara resorts to demonizing an opponent, without presenting one shred of information or documentation to back up his very strong opinion.  We have seen so much of this kind of intellectual cowardice for the last five years, when it rears its head in the JFK research community, it somehow seems even uglier.  Here's the challenge to you, Mssrs. Palmara and like-minded gang: exactly which facts do you dispute, how, and why?  Or would a sweeping statement like "anything Mr. Palmara writes is not worth considering" be valid to you, and just as acceptable as whatever pronouncement he might make? Of course not!  Where's the beef?  For me, Judyth's story is going to be 100% true, or it's going to be debunked. Mr. Palmara has not debunked anything. Yet. Step on up. Do it right.  Or don't waste OUR time listening to a pot call a kettle black.  Back to you -    
 all fans of reggae need this album. an absolutely great piece of work. fantastic melodies, rhythms, and harmonies. sheer joy radiates from the performances. this is music with a big heart and soul. "i'm alone in the wilderness," baby. yes i am. this is stirring stuff to lift one up. a great place to introduce yourself to reggae if you haven't gone there yet. and a must for any reggae collection 
 I saw this film a year after its release and I thought it was one of the worst films that I had seen in my life. I was puzzled by its blend of rock, sex, comedy, social commentary, and over-the-top violence.  It still ranks as providing me with one of the strangest moviegoing experiences that I have ever had.  Made on a shoestring budget, with a cast of unknowns, it made a tidy profit for Twentieth Century Fox and it's surprising that there wasn't a follow-up.  Now, thirty-five years later, I can look at it afresh and, through the DVD commentary and extra featurettes, I now see what director Russ Meyer had in mind when he crafted this cinematic oddity.  "Beyond" is more of an anti-film to anything made before it and, for that, it has a place in movie history.  On the supplemental disc, the viewer gets to hear from cast members, writer Roger Ebert, and others that had a hand in making "BVD".  Most of the actors from the film have aged gracefully with only Michael Blodgett, the hunk beheaded in the film, showing the "ravages of time".  "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" may not make the American Film Institute's TOP 100 films but its one that reflects its era and is certainly one of which baby boomers can relate 
 Ann Rinaldi never disappoints--Nine Days a Queen was another excellent novel. An interesting aspect is that it was written in the first person, as if Lady Jane Grey's ghost is telling the story. This point of view makes the reader sympathize more with Lady Jane.  Through this book, I learned some less-known facts about the Tudor period. I could relate to Lady Jane, and found myself in tears at many parts of the book.  This is a must for Ann Rinaldi fans, and fans of the Tudor period 
 I love this.  This is one of my favorites.  I know I'll get some flack, but I like Pure Blues as an Alvin Lee album, and  this deal at the Fillmore is pure Ten Years After.  Brought me back to '69 at the Boston Gardens.  this just isn't some record to complete a collection, this is...Yeah, that's right. It's good cuz it feels good 
 I studied under Mark DeKay, using the first edition of this book.  The second edition adds all of Mark's lectures into what was already a great book, full of very helpful rules of thumb for orientation, materials, siting, and a lot of other design recommendations.  A great book made even better the second time around 
 This classic story grabbed the attention of our 4 year old son from the first read. Now, hundreds of readings later, he still loves Harold. The simplicity of the story and the illustrations are soothing to both my son and me. I love reading this uncomplicated and yet symbolic story over and over again as much as my son loves hearing it over and over again 
 Well acted, good story line, not a typical dull, stupid Hollywood type movie. Oops maybe because it's not a Hollywood movie it's and Irish movie. Go Irish. Colin has nothing on Cillian. Good movie to buy you won't be dissappointed 
 This is an excellent collection of theological essays that make for pretty easy reading. Moreover, they are quite enjoyable for a guy like me who loves to see a little bit of ranting combined with theological reflection. In particular, Michael Baxter's critique of the American god, as represented by neoconservative John Neuhaus, was excellent and incisive. His arguments were precise and well-formulated and should definately make anyone who has been mislead into believing in a fictional "christian America" think twice. This type of reflection is all the more necessary given the kinds of gung-ho, god-bless-America nonsense that is spouted from so many sub-Christian theologians that don't realize that America is not the Church.     Budde's article on God not being a capitalist was also quite excellent. I'm not sure I can subscribe to his interpretation of Matthew 25, but the thrust of his article doesn't depend on it.     Cavanaugh's article on God not being relgious is also quite excellent, as is all his work in theological politics (see my other reviews of his books).    I highly recommend this book, particularly to those that are interested in radical discipleship, Christian discernment and cultural criticism. It really gives a good overview of the theology that undergirds the implications of true commitment and radical allegiance to Christ 
 This book is lively and informative.  I would say "shocking," but nothing shocks me anymore.  If the author is correct, the USIA is a sort of shadow embassy of the U.S., selling skewed, altered, and sometimes  false views of this culture to other countries, the intent being, in the  end, to drum up business for American companies.  There is nothing  altruistic or moral about the agency's goals, just the crass ideal of  selling American pop culture abroad while Americans themselves are kept  totally in the dark about the agency's doings.  What is sad is that, if  Americans knew what the USIA was up to, they probably wouldn't care 
 Feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a sweater. Love this movie, 50's detective noir set in 70's California. The beach, the hospital, Mexico, the supermarket, it's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over. Final scene pays homage to The Third Man, beautiful. A bit of violence, but "That's how I treat someone I love, and I don't even like you". Never seen an Elliot Gould movie I like more than this, & it's my favorite Altman as well 
 We originally bought this book at Plimoth Village. My children love it. Having photos of people in actual period dress makes it so much easier to understand that they were real people and they lived differently from us. I share our copy of the book with my children's teachers every fall and they all love it and beg for our copy. Tonight, I'm buying them their own 
 Mr. Oberg, an internationally recognized expert on the Russian (FSU) space program, provides an excellent description of the triumphs of the Soviet space program.  The story is fascinating, and the author clearly respects his subjects.  What's special about Oberg, though, is his perspective on Soviet affairs.  He is also a scholar of Russian studies, and rather than simply recounting historical data and technical details of the Soviets' space efforts, he also outlines the details of the political realities which the space program faced.  It makes a nice companion to studies of the US space program.  Highly recommended 
 THESE SONGS ALL ALL VERY NEW AND INNOVATIVE, KEEPING TRUE TO THE OUTKAST "STYLE" OF MUSIC. THERE ARE SEVERAL SONGS ON THE CD THAT JUST TOUCH A PART OF THE SOUL WITH THE COMBINATION OF LYRICS AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS. IN MANY CASES ONE CAN NOT HELP BUT DANCE OR SWAY ALONG. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS AN OUTKAST FAN, BUT ALSO THOSE WHO LIKE CREATIVE MUSIC THAT HAS CHARACTER. YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE. 
 Banned from American and British broadcast, this documentary is an essential look at the "other side." Whether you support the US war in Iraq, the informed citizen would benefit from a look at the control room. 
 Simply suberb; as good, perhaps better, than "Remains of the Day".  But I read it too fast while on vacation; needs reading at a slow measured pace.  Author's voice incessant throughout, with so much wisdom packed into so few pages.  Incredible how Forster foresaw today - the book is so current.  Our society is too full of movement and change; we need "only to connect"  - to connect to the earth, to each other, and perhaps, most importantly, to ourselves.  I did have trouble with Margaret's love for Henry Wilcox.  Why?  The movie was very well cast and holds up well to the book.  Just all the wise words left out 
 Surprised this picture didn't do better at the box office.  After making the dreadful Hearts and Souls (with Alfre Woodard, trying to out-do GHOST) and Speechless (the romantic comedy which killed the careers of both its stars, Geena Davis and Michael Keaton) director Ron Underwood bounced back with this inventive, lively remake of an earlier 1949 movie.  It should have made Charlize Theron, who plays Jill Young, a big, big star, but instead, Charlize had to bumble on for a few more years before winning an Oscar.  James Horner's music outdoes his heart-wrenching symphonic themes for TITANIC, BRAVEHEART, and THE ROCKETEER, with a touch of African percussion and wood and wind instruments that bring the plains of Africa into mind whenever you hear them.  Charlize has a lovely song, "Wind Song," sort of a lullaby for Mighty Joe, that should have been a hit on the scale of "MY HEART WILL GO ON."  But somehow people just weren't interested in this picture.  Maybe the forthcoming remake of KING KONG by Peter Jackson will have better luck with audiences.  It will have more publicity, for sure, for I don't think the studio was really behind Ron Underwood to the same degree that New Line supports Jackson.  What a cast!  Beyond Charlize and Bill Paxton, the movie also features Naveem Andrews (who plays Sayid on ABC's LOST) in a rather comic role, and also everyone's favorite REGINA KING from RAY.  If you liked AU HASARD BALTHAZAR by Robert Bresson, you will also enjoy MIGHTY JOE YOUNG the remake 
 This a great book for almost every child. I am an Education Major at Pima Community College in Tucson, Az. I work also work at a Pre-school and the childeren love this book (Childeren ages 12 months to 3 1/2 years). We read it atleast once a day. This is a great book because they don't know it but they are learning how to add and subtract, using cookies. It's great because if you read it aloud to them and then show them how many kids show up, then they start to realize how many cookies are actually there, and then it gets to how many cookies each child will get. The first time I read this book to my kids, they loved it and after the second time they stated to pick up on the subratcion part of the book and now every time we read the book they can come up with the anserws on thier own. It's really amazing to me how they will start to pick it up 
 excellent quality! waited yrs for this to be released on dvd. well worth the wait for any swashbuckling fan! 
 I love this book. I have read many books in my efforts to heal from anxiety/fear/paranoia, depression, and a poor self-image. There are many books that have helped me, and this one is in the Top 10. I am happy to say that I no longer suffer from those problems! I credit the books I've read, changing my thought patterns, my voyage of personal inner growth/soul-searching/discovery, making changes in my lifestyle, and getting away from people in my life who were toxic/negative/abusive. This book made me realize that some "old wounds" I thought I had recovered from ... had not fully healed yet. It also illuminated some wounds I hadn't thought about before, and provided ways to try to heal from them. I found this book to be very touching. The authors' insight and empathy is commendable 
 A wonderful series!  I loved every minute!  Great read for women of any age 
 I've had a copy of this book for at least 25 years and read it over and over. It is by a Brit, but so what? Make the stretch. It covers so many aspects of the subject that transcend goats that it would be informative to anyone interested in land management and animal husbandry in general. He deals with concepts of nutrition ecology and health hardly ever dealt with today, such as alternatives to the use of mainstream comercial feeds, rearing methods and things too numerous to mention, and all from a unique perspective. A true lover of goats. It's THE Bible of goats, written back in 1957 and never equaled to my  knowledge 
 I still have the cassette of this album (which I've had since 1995) and I plan on getting the CD soon. I bought her best of album last November.  Alanis Morissette made a dynamic album that fully defines grunge and alternative rock's 6-year dominance in the 90s.  Everything all clicks on here!  I still like to scream when singing the chorus of You Oughta Know! And still like to turn it up every time!  She's not taking no mess when she chews her man up for cheating on her in that song! This song just came out of nowhere in 1995 just as people were still playing their 1994 Hootie and the Blowfish albums way too much.  A lot of this album has to be personal, especially You Learn, Hand In My Pocket, Wake Up, Forgiven, Ironic and many others.  This album is strong in its rock sound, its lead guitars and full wall of sound on every cut! You Oughta even has shades of hip-hop's beats in its rock sound.  I was so pleased that it won Album of the Year at the Grammys (and I didn't even watch that show!) because it broke the mold of the same kind of safe pop album that those voters like to choose (soft and sappy Diane Warren-like pop ballads and so forth). This was the LOUD album that the Grammys finally chose long after Michael Jackson's hugely succesful Thriller from the '80s!  Alanis has still maintained a strong fan base and her music still sounds great with her later albums.  She does the music SHE wants to do and she is winning at all counts.  Jagged Little Pill will always be a favorite and a classic from me!    
 Jacques Ranciere is one of the most important French philosophers writing today. This work deftly shows how sociologists have, over the years, taken control of Marxist thought away from the philosophers who once had (perhaps) too firm of a grip. Did the philosophers do this willingly? Should theorizing the poor go back into the hands of the philosophers? Do sociologists do a better job writing from the proletarian's perspective? You'll have to read the book to find out 
 This mat does exactly what it's supposed to: it stays in place and keeps the baby from sliding in the bathtub.  And it's pretty cute too 
 I really enjoyed this album - all the great old motown songs that we sung along with and danced to are here.  May I suggest that you take a bit more care with the track listing.  2 out of 60 correct is an abysmal bit of work 
 Franz Wright's ILL LIT is an alternatingly comical and serious look at humanity from the perspective of a young disillusioned man who stares at his ceiling fan all day contemplating more often than not, the rustling of the leaves and the state of the weather. With a lot of genius lines that really bring you to his level of thinking 
 If you want to have the essential BB King in your CD catalog, then buy this CD.  IT captivates the best of his live work.  If you go and see him now, you will not get this wonderful raw blues that made him the man that he is.  This is one of the top 5 all time blues CD's out there. From "How blue can you get" to "The Thrill is gone" it bleeds with soul.  Then only shortcoming is that the ride is over too soon 
 All three movies from the collection (The Mummy, Mummy Returns and the Scorpian King).  All in widescreen and the coolest collectors case you would want. 
 After reading other books on how to use After Effects, this is the only book I found that gave really great how-to tips and tricks that I can easily apply to future projects. I didn't have time to read another huge manual, but flipping through chapters in this book was a breeze. I highly recommend this to anyone using After Effects, whether you are a novice user or a pro, everyone can benefit 
 BAker and Smith have a love affair with KKR.  It's now wonder after reading this book.  This book is easy to follow for beginners and rewarding to more seasoned LBO professionals.  Baker does well to highlight the drivers of these dealmakers and their thought process without muddling it down with toomuch technical analysis 
 This is a wonderful story about the south.  Fannie Flagg is a great storyteller. 
 Goldie Hawn is just perfect as Judy Benjamin, a young woman who is torn to pieces after the death of her husband just six hours after saying their vows.  Yes her husband dies right in the middle of making love to her.  That's enough to make anyone a little nuts.  While in this state of anxiety she calls up a local radio station under the persona of Jessica and laments about her situation.  While the radio receives dozens of callers wanting to give their advice, it's one in particular that gets Judy thinking, and with a little persuasion she up and joins the army under the false impression that she'll have her own condo and, if things prove too hard for her, she can just up and quit whenever she wants.  Little does she know, upon arriving at her base, she'll be bunked with quite a few other women (some of which are hardened criminals) and there will be no quitting for three years.  Worse yet is her Captain, Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) who's determination is to make Judy's stay complete hell.  Upon arriving Judy complains, she whines and fights and complains, tries to escape and, yes...complains, but after a meeting with her family and she understands just what they think of her she decides to take things a little more seriously, and she actually becomes quite good.    Through the course of the film she becomes a Thornbird and then, through no fault of her own, is transferred to the international theater in France where she rekindles a relationship with a French Obi-gyn (who obviously knows what he's doing if you get my drift) and then her relationship with her Captain who just so happens to be working in the same building as Judy, still determined to make her suffer.  The remainder of the film has Judy making life altering decisions as to whether she wants to leave the army and start a life with her French lover (Armand Assante) or if she's willing to give him up for her career.  The entire cast is outstanding, but especially Hawn who lights up the screen with her charm and beauty.  We all know where Kate gets it.  This is a great movie about self growth and the ability to become more than what people expect of us.  To her family Judy was always a screw-up, never making the right decisions, always needing to be bailed out of something, but throughout her stay in the army Judy became her own woman and proved to herself that she doesn't need anyone but herself.  A wonderfully delightful slice of entertainment 
 My friends, I have been tricked.  Throughly fooled.  Utterly led astray.  In short, Margaret Mahy may well be having a good laugh at my ineptitude.  Having known her to be considered perhaps the greatest young adult fantasy writer in the known world, I picked up "The Catalogue of the Universe" with my typical snotty snobby snitty opinions of what the story would entail.  Actually, since I like to read books without knowing ANYTHING about the plot ahead of time, my opinions of this book totaled one in number.  I was convinced that this was a fantasy book.  I mean, the title of the book is "The Catalogue of the Universe" for pete's sake.  The cover shows planets and young swimmy faces.  And it's written by the woman who wrote the illustrious "The Changeover".  So I picked up, read it through, and kept stopping at the end of each and every chapter to wonder where the magic was.  Let this be a lesson to all, you foolish reviewers like myself who prefer to infer storylines rather than, oh say, read the summaries on the backs of the books.  If you leap to conclusions, you're liable to make a fool of yourself.  And I adore telling the world when I've been silly, so it worked out perfectly for me.  In short (har har), "The Catalogue of the Universe" is a romantic, emotional, humorous, philosophical tale of two teens and the different ways in which they try to sort out the mysteries of the cosmos/their lives. 	 Angela is beautiful and she knows it.  She's the kind of girl who attracts men with relative ease and lives life exactly as she would like to.  Of course she has a crazy single mom and she lives in a house with an honest-to-goodness outhouse, but that's fine with her.  It's the fact that she's never met her biological father that stings.  All at once charming and impulsive, Angela decides to enmesh her best friend Tycho in her plans to meet her pop for the very first time.  Tycho has his own set of problems, however.  As a particularly romantic and philosophical young man (in no little part due to his name), Tycho's in love with Angela.  They both know this and they both know it's a hopeless situation.  Plus he has a crazy family to deal with and some serious self-esteem issues.  Still, in a series of wild confrontations, escapes, and rescues the two friends begin to learn a little more about themselves and their relationship with the Catalogue of the Universe. 	 Mahy places herself at a disadvantage right from the start.  She's placed her book squarely in the palms of a beautiful female protagonist.  Many otherwise well-written books have faltered with this kind of character (most notably the oft banned, "Blood and Chocolate").  When a teen girl is beautiful and knows it, it's incredibly difficult not to make her a conceited little cur.  Mahy tries her best to keep Angela under control, but the character is a little too headstrong and wild.  She's likable once in a while but thoroughly detestable others.  You begin to wonder why it is that fabulous Tycho (who I am personally nominating for the Best Datable Young Adult Novel Character Award of 1985) even hangs around her.  Sure she's pretty.  But she's also high-strung and insensitive to others.  In the hands of a lesser writer this would be a distinct problem.  Fortunately, Mahy's clever enough to split Angela's story with Tycho's.  You get an even look at the goings on in both their families.  It was with great relief that the reader leaves Angela's nutty adventures in the wings while Tycho takes the center stage.   	 It's funny, but I haven't even mentioned the scientific, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical discussions that pepper this book.  This is the perfect young adult novel for that kid who thinks about the big questions constantly.  The ideal reader of this book is a teen who understands why Tycho sticks sentences he likes over his bed so that he'll see them first thing in the morning.  Honestly, sometimes the discussions of the universe between Tycho and Angela went a little over my head.  I liked that.  It's a rare feeling to pick up a YA novel and feel left behind.  It makes you want to read the book over and over again.  It makes you want to (gasp, shudder) BUY the book.  This is a feeling I rarely have.  I have it now. 	 Just in case my mention of philosophy scared you off, I'm going to reel you into the I Love The Catalogue of the Universe Club by mentioning its humor.  This book is hee-larious.  Witty banter galore.  If you're a fan of fast-paced conversations containing biting wit, this book is also for you.  Tycho's discussions with his brother, if read aloud, would probably baffle some.  In a conversation with their mother about their older (and over adored) sister Africa, Tycho and his brother Richard discuss their parents' preference: 	 "Of course I'm jealous," Richard said, "and so is Tycho, aren't you, Tyke?  You often wondered why he was so short.  Well, I'll tell you now: it's jealousy that's stunted him". 	"I tried to grow," Tycho said, responding immediately.  "I did my best, but I was weighted down hour after hour by..." 	 That's a common conversation.  Fast dialogue and smart characters.  So smart, in fact, that you'll wish you were in the kitchen with them enjoying the full extent of their humor. 	 So the book has it all.  Mind-blowing theorems, romance, likable characters (on the whole), and funny passages.  In short, it's frighteningly well-written.  There aren't enough books in the world to compare to this brilliant little number.  If you know of any teen that wants a book that doesn't talk down to them or patronize them in the least, "The Catalogue of the Universe" is ideal.  It isn't a fantasy (as I discovered).  It's better.  It's reality in its finest light.    
 I didn't know Simon's voice from Garfunkel's voice until they went solo, and while Simon had his gifts and genius, Garfunkel has the voice! "When A Man Loves A Woman" is a version unlike any other of this song. It's soft, gentle and silken. He's not a rough and tough type but a man in love, like a morning songbird, he reveals his love to his mate. "Break Away" is the title track from his best LP (great LP cover and concept). "Bright Eyes" not a hit but a strong LP song. "(What A) Wonderful World" is interesting because it's a good song with a terrific threesome; however, it's not my favorite. "All I Know" and "Scissors Cut" are two of Jimmy Webb's songs. "All I Know" is one of Garfunkel's best, either with Simon or solo (rivals his work on "Bridge Over Troubled Waters" LP). "Scissors Cut" isn't as strong but deserves to be here. "I Only Have Eyes For You" remains his biggest solo hit. He does "I Only Have Eyes" in the same way he did "When A Man Loves A Woman". Very gentle and silken. "So Much In Love" is my least favorite song on this cd, in fact, it should have been left off! "99 Miles From L.A." another song from his "Break Away" LP. This remains, for me, one of the strongest songs of his career. His interpretation and voice were a perfect match for this song. "Second Avenue" is my favorite song by Garfunkel, and that says a lot (I would love to find Tim Moore's version on cd, he wrote this song and did an outstanding version). "A Heart In New York" remains a good LP song but not a hit. "I Have A Love" a really sentimental and beautiful duet. All in all, a wonderful collection of love songs and introduction to Garfunkel's solo career 
 In this review I would like to consider the second essay collected in this edition -'On the Difference between the Genius and the Apostle'- which is too often overlooked by readers. Kierkegaard begins this meditation by denouncing the tendency of nineteenth century Christians to assume (even hope that) the Apostles were 'geniuses'. But according to Kierkegaard "St. Paul cannot be compared with either Plato or Shakespeare, as a coiner of beautiful similes he comes pretty low down on the scale, as a stylist his name is quite obscure..." So, why read the Apostle Paul? "Genius is what it is of itself, i.e. through that which it is in itself; an Apostle is what he is by his divine authority..." The Apostle represents an Eternal Paradox, the Word made flesh, while the genius may initially be paradoxical "but ultimately the race will assimilate what was once a paradox in such a way that it is no longer paradoxical." Thus the mere 'genius' St. Paul becomes, like the 'mere' genius of Plato, another name one surveys in a 'History of Western Thought' college course.  But an "Apostle is not born; an Apostle is a man called and appointed by God, receiving a mission from him." And what of the Apostle's message? "The new which he may have to bring forth is the essential paradox. However long it may be proclaimed in the world it remains essentially and equally new, equally paradoxical, and no immanence can assimilate it." Kierkegaard is here maintaining that while the Hegelian dialectic may assimilate every other; it cannot assimilate the Eternal Other of God's Word - "for the essential paradox is the protest against immanence." And genius, or so Kierkegaard maintains, is merely the finest flower of imminence. "Divine authority is, qualitatively, the decisive factor." Thus ultimately the Apostle appeals to Authority while the genius can only has resort to his all-to-human reason and rhetoric.  Kierkegaard rightly sees this attempt to assimilate the category 'genius' to the category 'Apostle' as a consequence of modern skepticism about God and authority. But as a consequence of this assimilation the Apostle is "an examinee who appears on the market with a new teaching." And once this teaching is assimilated "there would cease to be any difference between the teacher and the learner."  Of course, this is the ideal of Enlightenment; knowledge spread through the world equalizes everyone. To these "impertinent people who will not obey, but want to reason" Kierkegaard says that, "Authority is, on the contrary, something which remains unchanged, which one cannot acquire even by understanding the doctrine perfectly." Divine Authority can never be subsumed in any dialectic because "if authority is not 'the other', if it is in any sense merely a higher potency within the identity, then there is no such thing as authority." In fact, "between man and man qua man, then, no established or continuous authority was conceivable..." Kierkegaard is indicating that either we submit to Divine Authority or we submit to nihilism. There is no third choice.  Many Christians agree with this last but still want to see the Apostle as a genius. But to do so is to make the same what is forever Other and to compare the Incomparable. "To ask whether Christ is profound is blasphemy, and is an attempt (whether conscious or not) to destroy Him surreptitiously; for the question conceals a doubt concerning His authority, and this attempt to weigh Him up is impertinent in its directness, behaving as though He were being examined, instead of which it is to Him that all power is given in heaven and upon earth." Kierkegaard reminds us that no apodictic statement can be profound. "The decisive thing is not the statement, but the fact that it was Christ who said it..." One is tempted to here sneer that people too unintelligent or immature to judge statements on their own will always need some authority. Of course, it is now commonly thought that the Enlightenment is the 'adulthood of the human race', as Kant once remarked. But this is the exact possibility that Kierkegaard is denying; humanity, in its relation to God, will never achieve adulthood. Humanity will always be under the Authority of the Divine Other.  Even the great genius of the genuine philosopher does not escape this stricture. "What Plato says on immortality really is profound, reached after deep study; but then poor Plato has no authority whatsoever." In fact, philosophy, which is thought to be the ultimate 'authority' for our modern 'enlightenment', can be considered the ultimate target of this essay. "The whole of modern philosophy is therefore affected, because it has done away with obedience on the one hand, and authority on the other, and then, in spite of everything, claims to be orthodox." By 'modern philosophy' Kierkegaard is of course here alluding to Hegel. The most important distinction that Kierkegaard makes between the philosopher (i.e., the greatest genius) and the Apostle is that it is only the Apostle that has a purpose, properly speaking. How can we recognize the Apostle? "...[T]hat a man is called by a revelation to go out in the world, to proclaim the Word, to act and to suffer, to a life of uninterrupted activity as the Lord's messenger." But it is otherwise with genius. "Genius has only an imminent teleology; the Apostle is absolutely, paradoxically, teleologically placed."   The genius is "an unnecessary superfluity and a precious ornament." This superfluity is underlined by Kierkegaard's closing remarks on genius: "he has nothing to do with others, he does not write in order that: in order to enlighten men or in order to help them along the right road, in order to bring about something; in short, he does not write in order that. The same is true of every genius. No genius has an in order that; the Apostle has absolutely and paradoxically, an in order that." A genuine 'in order that' (i.e. purpose) must come from God or it is only, at bottom, a private fancy. All philosophers, from Plato to Hegel and beyond, ultimately only have their word on the Truth of whatever it is they teach. Only the Apostle ultimately has a purpose, because it is only he that is not spreading some private fancy.  If there is a God then there is something that endures. If there is no God then we can only have a succession of genius de jour - forever. The History of Philosophy is in fact this History of 'genius de jour'. As High Modernity continues its long disintegration into our low postmodernity we see the consequences of trusting in genius without Authority. It has now been seen by our postmodern nihilists that, regarding their grand theories, Plato and Hegel (and Marx and Nietzsche) only have their word on it. Thus 'reasons' and, far more ominously, thus does everyone (or an ever increasing fraction of everyone) on the planet. Modernity had staked everything on philosophical creativity -the ongoing creation of 'world-views'- but the ongoing war between various philosophical artifacts makes on wonder about the intelligence of this bet. It is the various irreconcilable philosophical artifacts, and their world-views, that are tearing our world apart.   One certainly doesn't need to believe in Divine Authority in order to believe in the utility of authority. But, and this is the answer of philosophy to Kierkegaard's attack, if Divine Authority remains powerless (or unwilling) to enforce its Will then philosophy must continue to 'create'; that is, philosophy will continue to bring a temporary but unifying purpose into the world. All that philosophy has is this ersatz purpose to pit against nihilism - a world bereft of meaning and purpose. And this is all philosophy ever will have.. 
 I've read two and a half chapters in this book and it's given me so much vital information.  I highly suggest it to anyone looking into buddhism 
 This an excellent book!  A must have! I strongly recommend it to anyone willing to have a broad and at the same time in-depth view into the numerous concepts and APIs necessary for designing IDTV applications.   Several code snippets are provided to illustrate how each API can be used: this can help save a lot of time as the DVB MHP and OCAP specs are a little bit hermetic.

 This book is at the top of my list as a must-read for all of my coaching clients trying to negotiate the slippery slope of mid-life transition.  For the first time, we learn not only that we are different at mid-life and exactly HOW we are different.  Inventing the Rest of Our Lives is both reassuring and instructional 
 Past Master takes a rejuvenated Thomas More and places him in a future community which corresponds to his own Utopia. This is a novel full of heavy ideas; perhaps more than it can support; but there is a huge amount  here to reward somebody who gives the book the attention it demands 
 On that terrible day in 2003 when Fred Rogers left this planet, I openly wept at his loss.  I knew then and still believe that a man like Mister Rogers only comes along once in a lifetime.  Sadly, there may never be another television show as influential and downright healthy for children to watch.  The good news is that Anchor Bay has teamed up with Rogers' company, Family Communications, to begin releasing episodes of Mister Rogers Neighborhood on DVD.  The two episodes featured on this disc and its companion disc, "A Day at the Circus" are in as good a shape as I've seen them.  The bonus materials are also blessedly free of the fluff and commericialism that is so prevalent on children's videos today.  Disney, I'm talking to you!  My son is only fifteen months old, but already has fallen in love with Mister Rogers and his neighbors.  The program not only captures his attention, but he responds to it in ways that show me that he is truly involved with the events on the screen.  Mister Rogers was an important part of my childhood and I am so pleased that he will also be a part of my son's life.  Thank you, Mister Rogers 
 `The New Kitchen Science' by culinary journalist Howard Hillman is a new edition of a 20 year old book which uses the question and answer format common to a lot of cooking advice books. One small problem is that this format is not the best approach to presenting `science' in that science is a body of theories and explained phenomena the understanding of which facilitates applying knowledge to understanding new situations. So, if a book just answers questions, the ability to extend the answers to new situations may not be as good as other expository approaches. That said, I have to say that like Robert L. Wolke's `What Einstein told His Chef', this book may be more accessible to many readers than other conventional writers on the subject such as Harold McGee's works and `The Science of Cooking' by Bristol University (UK) don Peter Barham.  One thing a widely read foodie may want to consider is that they may have already seen most of the material in this book in the volumes cited above. This is not to say this book does not contain some new material, but a devoted reader of Shirley Corriher and Alton Brown may find this new material a bit sparse.  For the reader with little experience with food science reading, I caution you that there are some statements in this book, which are scientifically incorrect. This may be a small point, since the errors are not likely to interfere with your practical cooking, but they may interfere with your ability to extend your knowledge to new situations, which is the whole point of the scientific inquiry in the first place.  The first error I noticed is the statement that when a water / alcohol mixture is boiled, the alcohol will all boil off, leaving just water. One of the first things a freshman chemistry student learns is that this is not true. It is true that more alcohol will evaporate than water, until the alcohol and water attain equilibrium. Admittedly, the alcohol will be reduced to a very small level, but it is still there. This is important if someone has physical or religious problems with any alcohol. The second error I noticed is the use of the term `dissolved' when referring to the mixing of flour with water. The proper term here is `suspension', not `solution'. In some ways, this is a more serious error, as suspensions behave much differently than solutions, and the two states are pervasive in cooking techniques, so it is important to know the differences in behavior between the two states.  After all that nit picking, I can still recommend this as a really worthwhile source of information whereby one can improve your cooking, especially for the reasonable paperback price. One especially valuable feature of this book is the excellent bibliography which gives references for all the authors and works mentioned above except for Alton Brown, and a whole lot more.  If you really need to have fun with your reading about food science, I recommend `The Cook Book Decoder or Culinary Alchemy Explained' by retired Canadian professor of Chemistry, Arthur E. Grosser. This book has the added virtue of being great to pass food knowledge on to kids.  The claim to `science' in this book's title is a bit tarnished, but if you are new to foodie science, this book will give you lots of useful information and tell you how to avoid a lot of kitchen pitfalls. 
 If you meandered over to this listing, whether intentionally or by mistake, please buy this CD!  Two years ago I read a blurb about Rooney in "Rolling Stone" and decided to check them out (admittedly because I thought Robert Carmine was hot - hey, I'm human).  They quickly became my favorite band.    Catchy hooks and quirky lyrics make the tracks on Rooney's self-titled debut stick in your head until you sing them aloud to your friends.   Get your hands on the debut CD to catch up before their latest disc comes out this spring.  And while you're at it, head over to www.rooney-band.com for more info about this great band 
 We in the Western world all too rarely take the time to perceive and understand our modern society through anything other than Western eyes.  So it is as well with that wondrously tragic period of our history known as the Crusades.  While there are many contemperary histories of this era incorporating Western eye-witness accounts, there are but few with the perspectives of the invaded Orientals (i.e. Arabs, etc.).  So the uniqueness of an account written by a period-contemporary 'Arab-Syrian Gentleman' will not be lost on the reader.         "The Memoirs" are essentially just that:  an autobiography of a twelfth-century Arab Muslim and the experiences of his long and eventful life. From his earliest memories in Syria before the First Crusade to his twilight days in Egypt and Damascus, Munqidh shares his vast knowledge with the reader, imparting as well his personal, ingrained biases.  It is this latter which assists the reader in understanding the mind of the Crusading-era Muslim, even now oft-considered the enemy of Western "Christendom".  Indeed, some scholars argue that the key to understanding the Middle Easterner's distrustful eye to the West lies in the very heart of the Crusades.  Munqidh writes in the learned style one might expect of the educated nobility of his period, and though exquisitely detailed, he is neither long-winded nor boring.  So whether the avid scholar or simply the interested amateur, "The Memoirs of Usamah Ibn-Munqidh" is truly a worthy rea 
 Elegance:  - Refinement, grace, and beauty in movement, appearance, or manners.  - Tasteful opulence in form, decoration, or presentation.  - Restraint and grace of style.  - Scientific exactness and precision.  In other words, - Julia Child's The Way to Cook 
 This DVD covered a lot of the material mentioned in our school's Socical Studies curriculum.  I used it as a supplement my curriculum because it provides a great visual of this time of history.  I felt the themes of the importance of religion in peoples' lives, apprenticeship, rise of patriotism, and the means the minute men used to fight the war were explained well 
 I have had no problems with it.  I am completly happy 
 Before going into my review of this flashlight, you first need to ask yourself what do you need this flashlight for. Do you just need a simple and reliable flashlight, doesn't matter what kind of technology it uses? Or you need a super bright flashlight? Or do you want a flashlight that can reach very far? You will have to ask these question because LED flashlight is different from conventional flashlight. If you want a flashlight that can reach very far, stop reading this review and go get yourself a Mag-Lite with the Xenon bulb. Cause LED flashlight doesn't reach as far as a good conventional bulb flashlight. However, within the designated working distance (a.k.a focal point) of the LED flashlight, the brightness of a conventional flashlight is usually no match to the LED flashlight.  Now we have gotten this issue out of the way, lets get on with my review of this product. The X1 is the best compact size LED flashlight that use conventional type of battery, one AA battery in this case. It's alos the brightest in it's class. The X1 only use one LED bulb. You won't need to worry about how much light only one LED can make cause the special LED being used in this flashlight is bright enough to blind anybody if you point to their eyes directly. On top of the LED bulb, there is a clever designed convex lens that focus the light to a circular beam. Many other LED flashlight suffer from inefficiency cause their light beam aren't focused as this one therefore you only have a very bright bulb in your hands but it's not lighting up the object or area bright enough for you to see clearly. The use of the lens made this flashlight very power efficient. With the clever designed lens, one LED is enough for this flashlight while many other flashlight have to use 3 to 5 LED bulbs, which comsume battery faster.  This flashlight only use one AA battery and the LED bulb doesn't consume a lot of power. One alkaline battery can last for months of inconsistant use. I use this flashlight a lot everyday, and the Durcel Ultra AA battery that come with the package lasted for 6 months. I recommend using Durcel Ultra, Energizer e2 Lithium, Energizer e2 Titanium, or Energizer Ultimate battery so you don't have to replace the battery very soon.  The body of the flashlight is very strong and very well built. It is shock-proof and water resistant. I dropped it to concrete floor a few times and there isn't one scratch on the surface nor does the lens or the bulb break. The funishing is excellent. The texture of the shell is smooth enough for the touch and for sliding it in and out of the holster but have enough friction to stop it from slipping away from your hand. I stepped on it accidentially once and everything still intact and fine. I am not sure if it is as strong as my 3D-cell size Mag-lite or not cause I haven't run over it with my car yet but I don't think it's necessary to test it this way.  Another special feature of the X1 is its dual switch. You can lit up the flashlight fast by pressing your thumb and holding down on the speed button at the end of the it. Let it go and it turns off. You can also twist the end cap and turn it on permanently so that you don't need to hold it. Turn the cap to the opposite direction to turn it off. By twisting the end cap, you can also asjust the sensitive of the speed button.  The X1 also comes with a nylon holster which I think is another great features that make it stand out from other brands. The holster and the flashlight fits like a condom :> You can put the X1 in its holster on your belt. The light weight of the X1 make it innoticable no matter how long you carry it. I practically carry it along whenever I am out of my house ever since I bought it. It is so handly when I need it. Taking it out and puting it back into the holster is extremely easy. The holster is tight enough to hold the X1 in place and won't fall out even you jump a few times while loose enough for you take it out smoothly.  The bottom end of the X1 is built with a hole at the tip for you to hold it on a key-chain or a strap. However it doesn't come with a strap. This is the only minor draw back of the X1. I bought a tiny nylon cell-phone strap that you can find in those cell-phone accessories stores and strapped it to the hole which makes it easier to take it out of the holster fast and also further more prevent it droping from my hand.  I think a lot of you who consider buying this flashlight might also be thinking if you should get the X5 from the same company instead. I know it's hard to choose from these 2 great flashlight. Then you will need to ask yourself again how are you going to use the flashlight for. If you want a compact flashlight that you can carry it with you all the time on your belt or in your purse to be ready whenever you need it, then X1 is a sure bet. It's light weight, it's brightest in its class, and it uses a battery type that you can almost find in any store or gas station. The X5 is much brighter than the X1 and have a focus area much larger and further thant the X1, but it also consume more power. Also, the X5 uses special CR type batteries that are also used in many cameras, which may not be available everywhere (but most stores and gas stations in US these days carry these CR type batteries.) While also comes with a nylon holster, the X5 is still bigger than the X1 and may not be an ideal flashlight for you to carry it around like you can with the X1. If you want to put a flashlight in your car, then I would suggest you to get a X5 or a 3D-cell size Mag-lite. If you want to have a flashlight with you anywhere you go like your cellphone, then go get the X1.  Hope this review helps your buying decision. Thanks for reading (if you make it this far! 
 The scholar Peter Lee has written the best book to date on the subject of opium use from a Chinese perpective.  Opium paraphernalia is widely collected today and it's artistic qualities are now appreciated.  Mr. Lee book covers all aspects of opium use,it's history, it's repression and the reasons, it's rituals, and it's potential benifits as well as it's addictive properties.  For anyone who finds the lure of this ancient herb interesting, this is a great read.  Mr Lee brings this once hidden subject into the light with great insight and knowledge.  
 I have read all of Van Gulik's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite. The characters are intriguing and some sinister. The end is satisfying and bittersweet, challenging integrity vs justice. I would,  however, recommend you read the others first (chronological is good,  Chinese Gold Murders is first) to get to know the main characters although  this book can stand on on its own 
 I own three recordings of Bob  Bailey and all three contain songs with lyrics worth listening too coupled with a powerful 4 or 5 octave range voice which Bob has complete control of from top to bottom. I first heard Bob sing on TV, WOW, I was absolutely astounded! I am a singer and musician myself. I could hardly wait until there were recordings of this dynamic singer and messenger of song available. I wish that there were more or that Bob would record more cds. Does Bob  have other recordings, if so, please give up the info? 
 I saw this movie when I had like 16 now I am 23 and its still my favorite movie. The first time I saw it I though "wow what a great romance movie". It made me dream of traveling to Europe and find love, also it shows a lot of beautiful places in Italy. The characters are very unique and charming. Marisa and Robert were great in this movie. This movie inspires to dream with love and to believe in destiny. 
 Leading a group of academics can be like trying to herd cats. Given that - since Steven B. Sample succeeded as president of a major university - you would expect that he acquired some expertise on leadership, if only as a matter of survival. Sample borrows from an array of classical thinkers, from Shakespeare to Machiavelli to Lincoln, to advance his proposition that the most important attribute for any leader is the ability to think independently. He says that leadership demands suspending judgment, listening passionately to those with conflicting opinions and seeing all the shades of gray that exist between black and white alternatives. If his somewhat academic perspective doesn't always apply directly to the business world, it certainly supplies this book with intelligence and insight at every turn. We strongly recommend this guidebook to those who take these rare human attributes seriously. 
 This is a must read for Edgar Cayce's fans. Easy to read. More truth. Get enlightened with this book.  My favorite.. 
 Mr. Eisner explain the applications of the skills fostered by the fine arts educational experience. Giving especific examples, the author illuminates the dark side of the fine arts usefullness. On chapter four (soul of the book) deals with what can be expected from the fine arts experience and the real application of the acquired skills. More important, Eisner highlight the fact that the student has a self motivated and intrinsic satisfaction experience when learning thru the arts, something quite difficult to achieve with academics matters 
 I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more 
 A Real Life Great Gatsby   Ponzi is described as charismatic character similar to a real life Great Gatsby who has the mindset of an arbitrageur, the wit and character of a movie star, the style and personality of politician but the morals and values of a crook. It's too bad; it always bothers me when I read books about people with such potential that take a turn to the dark side, but I do love a non fiction that tells such a good story that it could almost be a fiction drama.   The book is very enjoyable. It takes us through a, "magical time, when anything felt possible". Ponzi starts his great scam just at the brink of the roaring 20's when prohibition-which started in Jan 1920 was just setting in and the Boston-Irish politics were played out through sometimes underhanded dealings and new inventions and discoveries had everyone excited about the future. All the while Ponzie is opening offices all over the East Coast collecting as much as several million in a single week. It describes Ponzi's Machiavellian outlook that the ends will justify the means and describes his continuous almost delusional optimism.   You may just find yourself rooting for Charles Ponzie to find a way to go legit, while he struggles to invest the $[...] million or so he collects through the issuance of his "Ponzi notes"    By Kivin Kingston author of, A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate: A True Story About the Ups And Downs from Wall Street to Real Estate Leading Up to Phenomenal Returns   My Blog: [... 
 This shoe is very comfortable during runs and also during high impact classes such as kickboxing.  I would highly recommend this, plus it looks really good too! 
 It was pretty tedious to read, but there were many points well taken and it was overall a very good, informative boo 
 This is one of the best film biographies of all time.  Gary Oldman (fresh from his triumph in "Sid & Nancy") and Alfred Molina (the greatest actor of his generation - look at this film along with "Frida" and "Enchanted April" and ask yourself if you don't agree) play the in-your-face gay writers Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell.  This film, based on the biography by John Lahr, tells their whole sorted story - how they met, became lovers, lived together, went to goal (apart from one another), and, finally, grew estranged as Orton found fame as playwright and Halliwell slipped into mental illness.  The two leads should have received Oscar nominations for their work here (indeed this film, the director, Vanessa Redgrave and the screenplay should all have been nominated).  Director Stephen Frears hasn't spared his audience any of the graphic details.  Orton was a sexual compulsive who liked to pick up strangers in public lavatories and bus stations.  The camera never flinches.  It all here - even the gruesome way their story ends.  Fascinating meterial.  Don't miss this one.  My one complaint about the DVD - no extras - nothing from the director, no documentary footage of Orton or any of his television appearances.  I recommend Lahr's book, as well as Orton's plays and those wonderful "Orton Diaries. 
 This is my absolute FAVORITE book of all time! I made all of my friends read it, and they agree that this book is one of the best we've ever read. The plot, drama, romance, adventure, the characters and the general diolouge suit this story's theme so well. Jefferson Davis Bussey is the kind of guy every girl wants to have, and Harold Keith makes him entirely beliveable by giving him emotions, loves and faults. I completely reccomend this book to anyone who loves closing a book with the intention of reading it over and over again 
 This is definitely a great album.  Better than most out there.  BUT, for those that said this is better than anything radiohead has ever done, get your retarded head out of your arse.  Muse is much more accessible to listeners, but that moment you truly get radiohead is an experience that only radiohead can provide.  This is not to take away from muse because this is a great piece of work.  
 This DVD has it all. It has the movie and the radio version of the movie which I've been looking for a long time now. It also shows how the movie was made which was really amazing to me. A lot of work went into the movie 
 Few food writers cut this close to the tender parts of our love for  eating. Her writing is rich in description, erudite and literate in its discussion of our rituals and habits. I enjoyed every page of this fine collection of essays, and have given it as the perfect gift to every person I know who smiles while chewing. 
 First off, this book is very entertaining to read. Unlike many political books, it is never tedious or redundant. "Thieves in High Places" is an accurate portrayal of what is wrong with both parties in America. It is also informative and insightful on the roles of big Corporations in American politics and local economies.   This book is a call to arms against large corporations that put locally owned businesses under, companies that use child labor overseas, and the entire Americal political system. This book empowers the common man in his fight for an egalitarian society, fair wages for all, and a real equal oppurtunity at an education. I loved this book, it was a pleasure to read, and confirmed everything that disuades me about America today. It is worth a read 
 It could be a little bigger but it really is big enough. At the beginning there was a tiny bit of lint coming off but after one wash it was fine. Definitely worth the price 
 Drucker took a lot of risks predicting the inevitable decline of commodity  prices, as well as the current East Asian/Japanese financial difficulties,  when this book was first published in the mid-1980's. More importantly he  details the reasoning behind his predictions. Drucker once again  demonstrates with this book why he is the Godfather of all management  "gurus"! 
 "The pictures you're about to see are of people who were once actually alive." So begins historian Michael Lesy's masterpiece - a by turns touching and disturbing examination of life and death in a small Wisconsin town during the final 15 years of the nineteenth century. Lesy stumbled across a cache of 30,000 glass plate images made by a local town photographer named Charley Van Schaick and spools of microfilm from the local newspaper - and combined the most compelling of these images and newspaper excerpts to create a vivid examination of Victorian prairie life. Although there are numerous post-mortem memorial photographs to add morbid appeal to the book, the newspaper and insane asylum excerpts are what I find absolutely enthralling. If ever anyone tries to suggest to you that times were better "before", you might want to refer them to these matter-of-fact tales of murder, suicide, insanity, and lethal pestilence. Death was a constant threat and entire families of 6 children could be wiped out by diptheria in a matter of days. It's no wonder that so many were driven to suicide: the depth of despair that these people must have gone through is at times palpable.   To give you an idea of the sort of macabre fascinations you can find in these olde newspapers, here are some excerpts: "The 60 year old wife of a farmer in Jackson, Washington County, killed herself by cutting her throat with a sheep shears"  "Mrs. James Baty... died suddenly of a hemorrhage of the lungs. She leaves a husband, her family of 6 children having died of diptheria last summer"  "Mrs. John Larson... drowned her 3 children in Lake St. Croix during a fit of insanity... Mrs. Larson imagines that devils pursue her" And my personal favorite: "Mrs. Carter... was taken sick at the marsh last week and fell down, sustaining internal injuries which have dethroned her reason. She has been removed to her home here and a few nights since arose from her bed and ran through the woods... A night or two after she was found trying to strangle herself with a towel... It is hoped the trouble is only temporary and that she may soon recover her mind"  You don't see entries like that in newspapers anymore!! 
 this movie was one of the better movies i've ever seen. as far as cute guys, great story-line, and talent go it's all that! i can't believe how  ne1 could not like it. i think it sends a very positive message out about  racial issues. and the movie also isn't mushy at all considering it's a  drama. if u like or dis like basketball it doesn't matter because it's  still a great movie no matter what! : 
 This book is just plain great from top to bottom.  Damodaran makes it easy to get both the "bird's eye view" as well as the nitty gritty detail you want in a corporate finance text.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something beyond an elementary understanding of finance. 
 "Mary Poppins" is a wonderful book with many fantastic adventures.  There is something clearly magical about Pamela Travers' creation.  In fact, it was such a special work that Walt Disney spent 20 years thinking about this story and several years in correspondence with Travers to gain approval from her and the rights to make a movie based on her stories.  Travers was quite reluctant as she had seen what happened many times when a film studio got ahold of a book.  It was not until Walt met with her in person, in London, that she agreed--but upon condition.  She had to agree with the work as it progressed, and in fact, remain as consultant to the film.  Travers met Julie Andrews and thought she was absolutely perfect for the role commenting that "she certainly has the nose" for the part.  After Disney spent 2 1/2 years working on Mary Poppins, Travers viewed what had been done, expressed her requirements, and continued as consultant on the film.   There has been much written about the faults of the Disney film.  Many have said that the characters and the feel of the story are utterly wrong.  That, in short, the story had been diluted and the vision lost.  I submit that there has never been such great effort put forth by a film maker to create a film that would remain true to its original written form. There certainly were many changes made.  The original story is not really one story, but rather, a string of adventures.  This would not work as a film.  What the Disney crew did was create a story line to stitch all of those little bits together.  The film was probably one of the greatest musicals created.  Travers, who was much like Poppins, herself was satisfied with the end product.  This speaks volumes. Read the books.  Watch the film.  You will not be at all disappointed 
 Its hard to imagine taking such a complex topic and creating a book that explains it without speaking down to the reader.  Simply one of the best explantory treatises I've ever read and thoroughly enjoyed.  A masterpiece! 
 This is clearly one of the best investment books written.  The title belies the breadth of valuable market knowledge the book offers students of the markets 
 This is an excellent book that I recommend to anyone just getting started in learning about futures.  The author writes in wonderful detail, and makes it easy for a person to understand the basics of the futures markets.   This book is *the* place to start - it's a must read for beginners 
 Beautiful photos and information about Christmas past; a lovely nostalgic remembrance of childhood holiday memories!  
 This bood is very short yet packed with essential golf tips for beginners.  There are photos almost every single page so it's like watching a video tape.  It takes less than 30 minutes to read the whole book, but I learned  a lot.  With price so low, you can't go wrong 
  Through this personal memoir, you get an insider's view on how intelligence and diplomatic communities work with and against each other and how they influence and are influenced by elected officials.  It's a delicate dance of meetings, hierarchies, secrets and logistics.  I like that Lilley first introduces himself to us through his childhood in China. Unlike other reviewers, I felt that the discussion of his brother was appropriate and just enough (not too much) for us to understand him and the significance his work had had for him.   We follow Lilley through his covert operations to being, through wide experience (and I presume great competence), exactly the man for various  important jobs when decisions are made to re-establish relations with China. Lilley, refreshingly, loves his work, and tells us what he is proud of and unabashedly, about his mistakes.  I was surprised to see some aspects of the CIA work in print.  While it is a moot point that Lilley flaunted British law in his CIA work in Hong Kong and Chinese law/protocol in China, I wondered about the propriety of these open admissions.  Even more surprising to see in print was the founding of communist groups in the Middle East to create fellow travelers who could travel to China. I presume these things, since they appear publically here, along with the CIA'S 1960's work in Laos are now common knowledge. Lilley writes some of them in sketches, some in facts, some in passing.  He gives no analysis or discussion of ramifications or controversies of these activities.  His straightforward approach to these assignments was probably essential to doing this kind of work.  Also of interest to those like me who often wonder how things "work", were the two "outings" he had, and how he overcame them to continue a useful career, a career he sees not as something for him, but something important for his country.     Lilley is clearly loyal to family, friends and country.  His career flourishes with Republicans and he is loyal to them too.  The problems caused by balancing Taiwan and China, and conflicts within and across administrations are presented with criticism of the Carter administration, but the framing of similar problems posed by Reagan/Bush (who do not agree on the China-Taiwan balance) are framed as "challenging".  He minimizes Fitzwater's exposure of the dissident Lilley was harboring in the embassy which results in over a year of domestic logistics and unneeded complications in relatonships.  (This dissident did not prove to share Lilley's quality of loyalty.)  Lilley and his various teams were skillful in managing Chinese relations in turbulent times, and the world owes him for this.  If you are interested in the Asia and the daily grind of the people who make it all happen, this book is for you.  
 Rannow has written a wonderful guide for the would-be comedy writer and a great read for everyone else. He shows us how to get the idea, write the script, sell it-- and ourselves-- to Hollywood, and even how to avoid those  cocaine parties when we hit it big.  He has put his considerable experience  as a Hollywood comedy writer into a guide that's as honest and funny as it  is helpful. Jerry never condescends. He simply assumes if he can do it, we  can do it. Lots of excerpts from real scripts here and even some inside  Hollywood gossip. Great book 
 I'm easily distracted from boring or pointless books, so when I found this book, I was surprised when I read it quickly cover to cover.  Then I had to recommend it to all my friends and family.  I'm going to buy several copies to give out now as it's such a good book.   I don't really want to give any details away, because I think that I had the best experience not knowing anything about it  before I read it.  I saw Joel interview on the morning show and he was extremely humble and charasmatic.  After hearing him interview and the morning show's reaction after reading it, I bought it the same day when I saw it in the airport.    Buy it, read it and give it to someone you love.    A+ overall.  I highly recommend it.  
 Things are going swimmingly in Fish! land. In the latest volume, Fish! Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! theories effectively. They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! function. The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! courses and merchandise - that's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. We suggest that if you haven't yet caught any Fish!, start with this one. Its cheery, accessible methods should lure you in, hook, line and sinker 
 This is a favorite in my house, second only to SINGING BABIES NURSERY RHYME TIME, a video that really has captivated my baby's every waking moment.  Between Baby Einstein and Singing Babies, my baby is set!  I highly recommend both videos 
 This album was my first exposure to Long John; my oldest friend Mike had (and still has) a penchant for scouring used record stores and came home with a slightly used, well cared-for copy.  He played it for me and I was hooked.  That was 33 years ago and "It Ain't Easy" still stands as my favorite blues rock album.  The humor he throws into "Conditional Discharge" (and later in the title track of his next project, "Everything Stops for Tea" ) speaks on a personal level,  while the power of his vocals, keyboarding and the guitars of Ron Wood and Sam Mitchell gives raw pure emotion to every track.  It is interesting to note that LJB appeared on the venerable BBC series "Top of the Pops" no less than 11 times (10 times between 1967 and 1969, the 11th in 1988) and not one of the performances showcased his "bluesy" side, but of his pop style (his top-of-the-charts hit "Let the Heartaches Begin" and "(Underneath the Sun in) Mexico" figured in 9 out of the 11 appearances).  I'm glad the blues won out.  Long John, you're sorely missed. Hats off to those at Warner who made the decision to release your landmark album to CD 
 I bought this to use with a small group of English language learners in kindergarten.  They loved it!  I overheard them singing the words to themselves on their own.  I used it to instill language patterns and to teach doing words and the names of animals by substituting other verbs and animals in the pattern, "Did you ever see a ____ (verbing) a ____?"  This activity also worked to develop a sense of rhyme.  My students' interest was highly engaged through the use of this book.  
 Dan always tells it like it is in a no-nonsense fashion.  The book is full of hard-nosed, pull-no-punches solid advice from the trenches. I highly recommend it. In fact, Dan Kennedy has really helped my business.  Applying what I learned from his courses allowed me to grow my "kitchen table" business into a nice six-figure a year income.  I like Dan Kennedy so much that I acquired a license to sell his "Magnetic Marketing" toolkit. It is highly recommended.  If you want Dan's "Magnetic Marketing" toolkit, check out  http://www.kentsayre.com/magneticmarketing  Kent 
 I grew up in a big old Victorian house a lot like Hill House, and one day when I was about 12 years old,and my folks were gone, I started reading The Haunting of Hill House.  let me tell you it scared me so bad I was frozen with fear.  I didn't go upstairs by myself for two weeks!  I suggest you read it in broad daylight with lots of people around.  ...and if you must see the movie, make sure it is the 1963 version.  The latest remake is worthless.  That was forty years  ago, and now I'm going to order a fresh copy of the book  so I can scare myself all over again!  If you have friends who "like to be scared". give them a copy of this book as a gift, it will scare the HELL out of them....Bwahahahahahaha! 
 Blimey, can it really be almost four years since Paglia has published a book? Her critique of 'The Birds' is one of the best of the BFI Classics series for several reasons. First, she approaches her nervy text like a detective, similar to the way Pauline Kael set about her research for 'The Citizen Kane Book'. Second, the book is thoughtfully designed and includes some nice photos that are not just the usual poorly reproduced film stills in faulty black and white; there is a startling pic on page 38 where Tippi Hedren resembles that other sensation of the early 1960s, Edie Sedgwick. Paglia probably insisted on the inclusion of the not-bad color film stills in the middle of the book; other BFI Classics I own show only poor B&W. (Remember, this is the woman who was going to "save" Madonna's 'Sex' book with layout advice!) Third, Paglia does a nice job of reviving Hedren's reputation as an actress and legitimate Hitchcock heroine, no easy feat after forty years of being hammered by most critics for not being Grace Kelly. A rare voice is scholar William Rothman's in 'Hitchcock - The Murderous Gaze' who calls Hedren "an exemplar of the difficulty and pain of expressing love", something that could never be said of wooden clotheshorse Kelly. Fourth, I like Paglia's ability to make fun of things she can't tolerate, her willingness to forgo a middlebrow politeness in her opinions, like Kael. "I want to slap her!" she writes contemptuously of "icky-sweet" Cathy Brenner, played by the youthful Veronica Cartwright. (Paglia might enjoy Cartwright's performances in both 'Alien' and 'The Witches of Eastwick': she is gruesomely dispatched in both, with virtuoso projectile vomiting special effects in 'Eastwick', a development undreamt of by Hitchcock, who merely has Cartwright run to the bathroom when she needs to purge.) Finally, Paglia is unique among most BFI Classics writers in that she does not impose incompatible intellectual or academic theories on a movie that can't support them. She is completely straightforward, something rare in 90s film studies 
 Kouzes and Posner are the coauthors of The Leadership Challenge, one of the classic leadership books.  In this book, they have repackaged those ideas for an academic audience.  While the ideas are not new, this recontextualization is very effective for applying them to the academic setting 
 The accompaniment is quite good.  It is beyond the intermediate player's skill.  Some of the song texts have been altered a bit from the original cast recording to make sense as a stand alone piece.  For instance "What is this feeling" utilizes the dueting parts but doesn't include with background chorus.  However it still "rocks" and stands alone extremely well.  Highly recommended if you have a super accompanist.  What a musical!! 
 I bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace I had seen at the Smithsonian Institute.  I love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi-strands of this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear.  By far, the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court.  With so much class it is still affordable.  This necklace is an exceptional gem.   
 Charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking.   Charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest 15-minutes charger I used. but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly.   The build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side. compare to the one I previously owned.   Generally, well worth the money.  GOOD BUY! 
 Our one year old grandson loves to lift the flaps in this book and brings it to us to read to him 
 The inward journey really "takes you deeper"!!  It's a phenomenal book as are so many of Gene's books. Gene is "out there" some would say, but not all of his books reflect his somewhat radical philosophy about church life. This book along with its 2 counterparts, The Highest Life and The Secret to the Christian Life are a wonderful look at the Christian life for anyone waning to "go deeper"! Gene calls the 3 books an "introduction" to the deeper Christian life, but if you do all that is contained in them, you will be more than "introduced" to the deeper Christian life! You'll have the desire to go deep with our Awesome God!!  Buy all 3 and read them in numerical order for the best effect!!  
 the only thing that I can rite negatively about this boox is that there isn't any story about me.  Did you know that I'm a former amateur boxing champion of Alvin, Texas 
 It is a beautiful book with great recipies that will really impress everyone... but the best part is that they are easy to do and use simple ingredients. The lemon tart is delicious 
 This was a great play, Deborah Cox was wonderful, the singing of all the characters was unbelievable.  The interaction between the male characters was hysterical.  The character of Khalif added just the right amount of spice to the pot without being over the top.  All in all a great play about the African American male-female relationship at all different age levels 
 Eismann again has produce an authorative, well written, easy to use book on CS2.  The best I have found 
 I was wondering if this book would be too similar to the "Holotropic Mind". No Way! I would liken it to the difference between a panoramic shot, and then zooming in for details. There is some overlap of the subject matter discussed, yet, we need the close-up perspective to get a better grasp on what we are talking about here... This book is VERY readable. Also, it goes by rather quickly, so don't let the number of pages daunt you. I am enjoying this book more than anything I have read since "Harry Potter". Also, I don't believe I'll ever do ketamine. Thank you, Dr. Grof 
 Excellent mystery, with interesting book notes thrown in.  Ex-cop Janeway is a well-developed protagonist.  This series of mysteries is always entertaining 
 I loved the book! It makes you love the characters, especially Makenna and Cogswallop. It also, unlike many fantasy/adventure books had an unexpected ending, leaving you content, and wanting for more books 
 Kazik was a 19-year-old Jewish lad who survived the Nazi terror and systematic mass killings of Jews, the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943 and the Warsaw uprising of 1944.  He was also led many fighters out of the ghetto through the sewer, and he was responsible for the care of many Jews who were hiding in Polish homes. Kazik also managed to find shelters for his parents and his two sisters, and after the war he was one of the very few Jews whose parents were still alive. After the war, Kazik, his sister Raya and parents all immigrated to Israel. Kazik's other sister, Dina, was killed during the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Kazik didn't at that time know that his sister was in the ghetto.  I found the book interesting and heart gripping at the same time. It is amazing to read how Kazik manages to stay alive, and always seems to stay one step ahead of the Nazis and their helpers.   Kazik writes how he found one thing difficult when he arrived in Israel: When he told people that he was one of the very few survivors, it seemed like some almost blamed him for having survived. Kazik tells how people kept on asking him about people who had died, but never about those who had survived. This made him reluctant to talk about his past.  He writes about how one man told him that he (= Kazik) screamed every night in his sleep.  If Kazik had made a volume II about his life after the war, I surely would have read the book. His history is fascinating, and I hope his life was mainly a happy one after he immigrated to Israel. I liked this book, and I found Kazik's story very interesting. Kazik tells us that he is not much of a talker, and that it was therefore difficult to dictate this book to the writer. Kazik may not be a talker or a skilled writer, but his story is one it is hard to forget.  
 I have been using the top 100 fantasy web pageto get ideas of what to read, and for the most part, the favorites of the masses have been helpful recommendations. This  book was ranked rather high, so I kept an eye out for it... for two years.  Nowhere to be found. Even here. Yet you can read here that its won some  prestigeous awards. After finally finding a copy in a dusty library, I  rushed home to read it aware that it had been built up in my mind for all  this time- and it in no way disappointed! A decent culture, and fun delemas  and situations, but what made this stand alone story really shine was the  characters. Nothing steriotypical about them. They are real people in a  very imaginative, yet realistic world. It may be tough at first to get used  to his style, and the speaking habits of his characters, but twenty pages  in it doesnt phase you, and by the end of the book you want more 
 I have this book and the West book.  There is not question this book is better.  West waves his hands at a lot of problems but never works them out in a detailed way.  That isn't the way I learn.  This book takes you through detailed solutions so you can better understand the concepts involved.  I didn't have time to read the whole book but whenever I was confused by a professor I could look it up in this book and figure the problem out 
 Yes, this is a classic album.  The title track is evil, in a good way.  Songs with two strong hooks should be outlawed.  I'm old enough to remember when the album was released and I have to say that Nirvana did a better version of 'The Man Who Sold The World' 
 I have the same opinion as everyone else, the controller is very convenient, appealing, affordable and fun, but......it suddenly stopped working....i think there are some problems with the wireless connection, and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and BOOM....your controller stops respondind..... and you get killed.....IT SUCKS!!!  i see that a lot of people have the same problem that i do....what i do to solve it, is changing the batteries and then putting them back again, or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again...that has worked for me.....it sounds silly but somehow works....  so, if you want a great wireless controller, this is it, but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too......  
 ALtough this isn't the best or most sophisticated work Nietzsche has to offer, it certainly is worth reading for anyone interested in his life and works. It is some kind of summary of everything he has said in his previous  books. Christianity, morals, Kant.. it's all in here. His last attempt to  show the world what it's all about, just before he went insane. My favorite  part are the first couple of pages where statements can be found like  "Is man just a mistake of God, or is God just a mistake of man?".  Absolutely recommended for anyone whose interested in philosephy in general  and Nietzsche particulary 
 I have been a big Star Wars fan since the first film was released back in 1977. I used to own many of the old action figures and played with them all the time up until my grandmother gave them away to the Goodwill. I picked up this book in 1997 just as I was getting back into collecting Star Wars figures once again. This is a very detailed book with lots of great color photos. Seeing the pictures of all of the older toys brought back a lot of memories. And it makes you stop and think about how much your old collection would have been worth if you had saved it. I recommend this book to anyone who is a true Star Wars fan and collector. You will not be disappointed 
 I enjoyed Bergreen's book about Irving Berlin as I did his book on Al Capone.  To think that all these great songs came from one man simply boggles the mind 
 Dr. Kupers articulates in clear detail the serious problems confronting persons within the prison system. With an unfailing eye, he depicts the ravages extolled on prisoners in the name of justice and... expediency. The  problems, most often, manifest in the form of mental health issues that  custodial staff are incapable of addressing. Dr. Kupers suggest effective  solutions for dealing with the mental health needs of the incarcerated and  the needs of society at large. A must read for anyone in Corrections or  Forensics 
 It seems like this book is getting a bad rap for being, well, horrible. But the fact of the matter is that it isn't horrible at all. Following up such a stellar series with a equally, if not more so, stellar ending, is something that is very difficult to do. We know some stuff that happened thanks to tidbits mentioned here and there during Season 5 of Angel. But now those huge gaping holes are filled in, and with rich detail and great story.  The book plays out logically over time, probably about a year and a half is my estimate, from the exact moment when Sunnydale was destroyed. It's written in such a way that new fans can pick it up and instantly get into the verse, but has small hints to long and loyal fans of times past. Characters who have been long-absent reappear throughout, and some of our favorites are mentioned and shown as well.  One of my favorite things about this book is the subtle mentioning of the goings on in LA, and towards the end more of the actual SHOWING of what's going on there during the big battle.   The book plays out with a typical end-of-the-world plotline, but we wouldn't expect anything less from Buffy. Once again our favorite heros are pitted against a world that's falling into disarray, and the evil is attempting to counterbalance all the good that Buffy has done by closing the Sunnydale Hellmouth. The stakes are raised, as our Scoobs move on to new trials and tribulations, hardships, fights and adventures, and yes, new relationships.   The ending of the book is left open to interpretation--not that it ends on a cliffhanger, but that you can interpret for yourself what the point attempting to be made actually is. Personally, I would have liked something different, though the ending was quite adequate for the story that was being told. The 3-person being that seemed to appear as a girl was a bit startling--you'll see what I mean when you pick up the book.  This book is written for adults, and the material is not dumbed down for a younger fanbase, which is often the problem many fans encounter when reading verse novels. The concepts are simple yet broad, and the language is on par with what our characters would actually say, think, and do.  I recommened this book to anyone who wants to find out what may have happened after Sunnydale, even though it'll soon be negated by the upcoming Season 8 comics being released 
 This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.       
 If you have an ounce of love for the sea, and a tad bit more interested in pirate tunes, you'll love this double cd collection.  I've gifted it to a half dozen friends who own boats, love time on the water and on occasion, drink a bit of rum...all with a bit of pirate in their hearts. This CD set will not disappoint....songs from Sting, Bono and many others who I didn't know, but do now (like Baby Gramps) 
 This book is essentially the same as her original work- The Comte de St.Germain, The Secret of Kings. The older book was a spiral bound book done by Mrs. Oakley. This newer book was picked up by Kessinger Publishing. This is an excellent book for those who are interested in studying the historical evidence of the great Immortal, St. Germain known as The Wonderman of Europe. He was ageless and deathless and held the secret to the philosopher's stone. This book gives the reader details about St. Germain's interaction with the great Royal houses of Europe from their own diaires. Packed with plenty of intrigue, drama, and secret meetings you will enjoy reading the memoirs and diaries of those who met and interacted with this great man. If you wish further study of St. Germain I suggest buying these two books: Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence by Godfre Ray King.  I have personally met St. Germain as well as many other Immortals and I can assure you they are very real 
 This was a very romantic read - not quite as spicey as the bedroom scenes were rather weak and kind of awkward.  However the two characters were very endearing and you really can see a wonderful relationship developing between them.  Judith's children were adorable and Leander was quite taken by them.  One of the very best parts of this series is that Beverely always keeps you updated on the characters that were introduced before. This is one of the reasons I love this series so much - a little like the Cynster novels of Stephanie Laurens.  In Christmas Angel both Nicholas and Lucien are brought into the story in significant ways and it really solidifies the friendship of this company of rouges.  I love this series! 
 I'd not seen this film until a day or two ago, and spent the first half of it genuinely puzzled at why anyone would like it.  I felt sorry for the protagonist's lack of "skills" and found it really hard to laugh at him without significant qualms of conscience.  Hell, maybe I even identified with him - who among us has not felt rejected, alienated and maladroit in high school?  Thank God the friend I was watching this with said, about halfway through, "I don't mind laughing at Napoleon's character because he really does not seem to care what we think of him.  He almost doesn't care about anything."  Then it clicked.  I enjoyed the rest of the film and was really glad that my host knew to wait through the end of the credits and see the "real ending."  You'll enjoy this film, so long as you give yourself permission to laugh.  Maybe you should get a permission slip from the principal's office 
 The Dead Zone is quite possibly Stephen King's most moving work.  Only a short way into this novel, written early in his career, the kind of sentimental and sympathetic characterizations that King would later use to great effect in the Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis is easily apparent.  In fact, he very likely succeeds better with this work than in the latter two.  One thing to keep in mind if you're planning to start on this book (and I highly suggest you do so, the characters are the most real and heartbreaking that you're likely to find in a King novel) is that it is not horror and it is, in the end, an account of the life and times of Johnny Smith.  To my mind, this entire story is a study for loss and the terrible, painful, necessary trait we humans have of moving on, forgetting those we have lost and... replacing them.  Johnny experiences this first hand, and much of the story revolves around his attempts at reintigrating himself into a world that kept going without him and couldn't care less if he lived or died.    Many are annoyed by the subplots in the story or by the rather brief resolution of the Greg Stillson story thread.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the entire Greg Stillson "problem" was placed in the story simply to aid Johnny in coming to his final, inevitable conclusion to the answer of what to do with his new, nearly empty life.  Could there be any other outcome?  Stillson is almost a deus ex machina in what he ultimately provides for Johnny.    In the end, this is one of King's best novels.  The reader can easily see themselves in Smith's shoes and can experience through him the realization of fears we all have: of being forgotten, of having the world pass us by 
 This book is a great book for beginners. I am graphic designer who has succumbed to the overwhelming need of web design and I bought this book to guide me from start to finish. It is a guide that helps you through the whole process. From HTML/XHTML to CSS and some JavaScript 
 Got this book hot off the press in Chicago.  This is a wonderful book on the philosopy of urban missions.  I am making this a required text for all my staff and volunteers.  Following the priniciples of Christian Community  Development, it gives a great theological defense of ministering to the  city and many practical examples from people who've ministered in the  trenches.  Each chapter also includes questions for group discussions.   Praise God for this urban ministry handbook 
 I have been looking for a book this good for a long time. This is a gem 
 This is an absolutely fantastic book. I have read hundreds of motivational and self-help books over the years, but as a business owner, I have never read a more incisive and life-transforming book as this one.    The author's experiences are so relevant to issues we all face and the practical applications at the end of each chapter adds to the value of this book. It is easy to read and forces you to see your life in an entirely new light.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever encountered adversity of any kind.  
 A veteran of the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War who mysteriously disappeared during the 1910-20 Mexican Civil War, the caustically irreverent Bierce was the H. L. Mencken of the 19th century (or Mencken was the Bierce of the 20th century).  His timeless and ego-deflating observations of Homo Sapiens reminds us that today's 21st century politics and pop culture were well-known to this 1842-born iconoclast.  For instance, he defined a conservative as, "A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others" (1993 p.18).  He defined a homeopathist as "The humorist of the medical profession" (p.51).  He defined a clairvoyant as "A person, commonly a woman, who has the power of seeing that which is invisible to her patron-- namely, that he is a blockhead (p.16).  The expositions on everything from men and women to ghouls are too long to quote here but are also incisively amusing 
 An essential read for anyone getting involved in politics. Chris Matthews teaches political maxims through parables. Learn how Presidents Reagan, Johnson, Kennedy, and many others used the lessons espoused in this book to get to the top. If I had a friend who was getting involved in politics and wanted to read only one book, I'd give them a copy of Hardball -- and then get out of their way. 
 A new children's mystery series from A - Z.  Meet Dink, Josh and Ruth Rose and enjoy their adventures in Green Lawn.  Help them solve who robbed Green Lawn Savings Bank.  A great way to spend quality time with your children and have fun together as a family.  Can't wait for the "Canary Caper" to become available 
 Economists and historians predict the past, while futurists, well, they predict the future. There are pitfalls for both. For those who want to prepare for, understand, or capitalize on the future, Future Think is an extremely is a valuable tool or weapon. Weiner and Brown are fearless as to how to identify, measure, and apply current happenstances to possible future consequences, trends, and events. This is critical for those who work in institutions where they must convince traditonal or freightened decision makers that their new vision is well founded.              Future Think offers numerous methods of how to assess the future including Trend/Countertrend. This is when two contradictory effects emanate from the same cause. They suggest instead of denying either side of the contradiction, try to understand and apply the lessons from both.              They also cite specifics trends regarding ageing, technology, and social behavior. These can be employed by just about any profit and non-for-profit entity. Future Think is not an amorphous compendium of tenuous suppositions and tedious equations but a valuable and conversational guide for the mining and refining of information 
 This is an Excellent Book on Tattoos. The variety and quality of both the tattoos and the photos of them are extremely good. I have not got to read the text yet, I have been so engrossed in the photos. The book does not focus on just the big name tattooists like a lot of books out there, but this has not held back on the quality and originality of the pieces in the book 
 Everything a Renaissance fan would expect. Annie Haslam couldn't be better and the excellent male vocals on "Kindness" and "She is Love" is an unexpected surprise.  The title cut "Song for All Seasons" as well as "Day of the Dreamer" are Renaissance classics.  This is an excellent recording, recommended for all.  You don't have to be a Renaissance fan to enjoy this one 
 This was a great book which really helped me get a good foundation on clean web page design. Easy to read and great examples 
 It's obvious Hank III anticipates the criticism that's leveled at him. And after a listen to Straight To Hell, it's obvious he don't care. If there's a word to describe what Hank III is doing, it's refeshing. This is straight up traditional Country, with a dash of punk attitude sprinkled across it. This is where you come to escape the souless garbage that's been festering in Nashville since the rise of Garth Brooks. There's anger here, and lots of self-destruction, all coming at you with a voice that has crossed the ocean of Country music history. Indeed, Hank III is all too aware of the shoulders he's standing on, and wears his blood as a badge of honor, laughing at the choir boy image of Country with a depraved sneer. David Allen Coe and Johnny Cash would be proud. At one point, Hank III shoots point blank range at New Country with Dick in Dixie, unleashing his hatred for Nashville's direction. But perhaps his biggest middle finger is pointed at Pop Country on the second disc, which contains 42 minutes of old songs, sound effects, evangelical preaching, and animal noises all wonderfully mashed together. Hank III is the real deal. An outlaw among fake outlaws. A real Southern rebel. 
 I got this car for my two year old son and he absolutley loves it!  He shakes it up and just lets it go and it keeps him busy for a while which of course is great 
 No problems at all I am very happy with the service and the book 
 This book was transleted in Brasil with de title "Além da Maternidade - Optando por uma vida sem Filhos". I'm psychologist and I've been  recomended for students and friends 
 I might be what most people would consider below average in the looks department so I've never been very lucky when it came to getting with the ladies. I've purchased a number of "how to pick up chicks" books but none of the ones I've read seem to be written with guys like me in mind. But finally here is a book that showed me different ways to score with pretty chicks no matter what you looked like. But the two things I liked best about this book was the in-depth lessons on to get mail-order brides and all these sex resorts I never knew existed all I can say is THANK'S GUY and how did you learn all of this stuff in one short lifetime 
 My daughter was not particularly interested in hearing a story the first time we opened this book, but within a few pages, the magic of the story, and the wonderful cadence of the words,  captured her attention.  She was  spell bound to the end.  The story was an opportunity to talk to her about  another culture, teach her about the concepts of fables and oral  traditions, and to just plainly entertain her 
 I have tried to abide by a discipline to read at least one Shakespearean play a year.  I rarely if ever have reviewed any of them because they are so picked over that I don't feel that I have anything to add.  However, it was with a good deal of anticipation that I stepped away from the renowned to the obscure by reading "King Henry VIII".  I say that because it was the subject that interested me and I admit that it made quite a difference reading a play about someone I knew something about.  This, in turn, gave me pause to consider many things about "King Henry VIII" that I would never have even known to consider about his other histories.  It's not that I read many of his other histories but those that I had read left me completely at the mercy of the Bard for any sort of perspective or overview.    What I found most interesting about "King Henry VIII" is the limited scope that the play covered.  Let's face it: even today Ol' King Henry VIII is a treasure chest of plots and subplots.  Yet Shakespeare treated his subject with a great deal of respect and, essentially, rewrote history before it was even written.  The four or five main characters (with the exception of Cardinal Wolsley) all come across in good light.  Perhaps Ann "Bullen" is a bit empty-headed but certainly Henry, Anne of Aragon and the lesser known (outside of the Church) Thomas Cranmer are all noble through and through.  There is little of the bawdy, glutonous Henry that history has given us.  You would guess that Shakespeare would have done great things with such a subject but he didn't and the question that I asked myself was; WHY?  I have not studied anything about this play.  I prefer to always see what the play says directly to me before being told by others as to what it means.  Thus I may be stating the obvious but I came away with the conclusion that "King Henry VIII" was written for Shakespeare's Quenn Elizabeth.  It was pretty obvious when reading Cranmenr's final speech and it put everything into perspective.  All that went before were noble and all that came after were not even mentioned.  The "noble" divorce of Henry and Ann of Aragon was necessary so that Henry have the proper opportunity to sire Elizabeth.  I'm not sure enough of my timetables to know if Elizabeth I was still alive when this play came out but even if she weren't it would still be the Bard's tribute to her.  I had come to expect that most of the "good stuff" of Shakespeare (with the exception of "King Henry V") was to be found in his tragedies primarily and comedies next with the histories coming up a poor third.  However, I kept my pencil busy underling passages in "King Henry VIII".  It is a good play, it's not "MacBeth", but it's a good play.  I'd have considered rating it 5 stars but then we'd have to rate some of the rest as 7's 8's and 9's.  Most people who'd take the time to read Shakespeare probably already have a pretty good working knowledge of at least the popular history of the King with six wives.  Read it for yourself and I think that you, too, will find that history is better understood when you are already familiar with the subject.       
 I have read all 5 of the Womens's Murder Club series and look forward to another.  If you like to read about successful women, this series is for you.  They are fun to read and very exciting.  Happy reading.  
 I have not read this book but I plan to.  However, half the value of these cheap business books (and this one, a hardcover, has been reduced in price to a mere $10 so it's worth the investment) is to put them on your office bookshelf and impress others.  In this case, it's a book that will become an instant classic, in that not only is the cover worth the price of the book but the contents are also seemingly good, if you read the other reviews here 
 one of the biggest challenges, particularly for those of us in the Great Boomer Glut who are at least 15 years from retirement.  This book is phenomenal for middle and older adults who want to tune up their math chops after many years of neglect.  It's funny how many people in the world WILL NOT actually TEACH math to you or anyone else.  Sometimes I think the whole ridiculous "tough love" mentality started in someone's math department.  Marcie is a magnificent exception.  Marcie's two best attributes in this book are: 1) She is more than happy to break everything down into easy-to-latch-onto baby steps; and 2) Her whole focus is INCLUSIVE and supportive.  Working through this book, I've been pleasantly surprised to discover how much I remember and can still do.  More importantly, this book seems to have identified exactly where my cut-off point is -- and then extended it substantially further.  For example, I've known about the Pythagorean Theorem for years but this is the first time I ever saw the picture of a triangle with squares coming off each of the 3 sides.  Wow!  Suddenly I see it in a whole different light.  And then using it to measure "crow flying" distance between points only reachable via L shaped road patterns.  Now, I'm ready to jump into Painless Algebra, more confident than I have been about math in a long time.  My only regret is that, to my knowledge, there is no Painless Trigonometry, Painless Calculus or Painless Statistics.  Barrons should create these so I can buy them.  Thanks, Marcie.  Thanks, Barrons 
 A fine example of these boys live!-demonstrates how the entire band functioned together like a well tuned machine. The audience response of this live show indicates that it just doesnt get any better than this! the music is timeless-the musicians masters 
 This is the first book I've read by Clive Cussler.  Every other book I've read by him are just as great! All Dirk Pitt novels are action movie type books. Dirk Pitt and Giordino(character) are two of my favorite characters of all time.  Clive really out-does himself.  Magnificent peice of work 
 I bought this CD for one song ("Maybe It's Me").  I usually don't buy CDs for one song, but I liked this one so much and found it at such a good price, I decided to try it.  I have decided that I LOVE this band!  I plan to share this CD with everyone I know and try to get everyone to like them as much as I do 
 This film is interesting to me for the following two reasons:  1.  It takes off from the portrayal of two of the main characters and becomes a character study of them within the context of a police spy thriller and war film,as well as a historical documentand a picture of my city,New York,right after WWII when I was growing up.  2.  The film becomes an Expressionist film noir in the last few minutes, with the death of the female leader of the German Nazi spy ring who is shot accidentally by one of her own henchmen, while trying to escape from the FBI who have surrounded the house.Photographed in a cloud of tear gas,starkly lit in light and shade in a half-darkened house, the ambiguous figure of the "transvestite" female spy is heightened and moves the picture momentarily into another realm.  The second story running besides the one of the double agent,played by William Eythe working with the FBI agent,Lloyd Nolan,to crack the spy ring run out of a house (actually on 93rd St.originally,not 92nd St.)is the study of the two curious Nazis,Signe Hasso,a Swedish actress playing Elsa, a German spy posing as a dress designer who is leading a double life dressing as a man to facilitate her movements around the city and the English actor Leo G. Carroll,playing Colonel Hammersohn,who recites his important distinguished romantic background to William Eythe when they first meet, as a spy during WWI,evidently unapprehended,and who dresses in the manner of someone from around 1910,carries a walking stick and has stylized gestures and is the one who is at least partially responsible for saving's Eythe's life at the end of the film. Who are both of these people?  These two finely thought-out characters,plus the intensity given in the portayal of the fine supporting cast of Nazi collaborators, particularly Lydia St.Clair as a fierce Gestapo agent are part of what makes "The House on 92nd St."really interesting in its attempt to give dramatic and well-written frames for some of its more fantastic characters and their twisted reasons for doing what they do. That they have lives outside of the film to speculate upon only gives more depth to an unsual motion picture. 
 This episode is a bit different than the others I have seen, although I have not yet seen all of season 2 yet.  Without giving anything away, this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings.  Additionally, it has some inventive guest characters.  Finally, it presents some moral and ethical questions 
 I've been a fan of Katherine Forrest's writing since I first read Amateur City in the mid 1980s. No fan of science fiction, I read Daughters of a Coral Dawn (the beginning of what would become a trilogy that included Emerald Dusk) only because of my respect for her writing. I did not expect it to become one of my favorite novels, but it did. Daughters of an Emerald Dusk is more than merely a worthy follower to that extraordinary book, and its superb successor, Daughters of an Amber Noon. It is a book in which Forrest's writing moves to a new level of skill and craft and artistry. I found myself rereading passages just for the pleasure of her prose. Forrest's characters are always a vital part of what makes all of her writing splendid, but seeing these characters, many of whom we know from the previous books, face the challenges that do with wit and honor and bravery is an extraordinary experience. I won't say anything about the plot except that it took me to places I would never have imagined without once betraying the reader with cheap tricks and flashy games. Daughters of an Emerald Dusk may just be Katherine Forrest's best novel to date, and that is saying something. 
 This episode is a classic, and is one of the best in the series. It explores time travel and alternate time lines, and it's storytelling had paved the way for many screen plays that followed. 
 Who knew that she is where the expression "She who must be obeyed" came from.  What a story and still worth a read 
  I bought this book a couple months ago and I was pretty impressed. Not only does it cover plenty of Chin Na techniques (and even the rarer finger chin na), but also counters for them. Of course these counters are not set and once an understanding of chin na and human anatomy is understood one can employ various different methods for both grappling and countering. Also, he explains alot of the Dim Mak methods and techniques (not in great detail as it is one of the most dangerous aspects of advanced kung fu), but just enough so you know whats out there and how dangerous it is, including the rupturing of the internal organs (or even death) through concentrated chi strikes with fingers. He also shows some cavity grabs.      This is not every Chin Na technique imaginable as someone said, In fact the only con of the book is that Ming mostly shows (if not all) White crane Chin Na, which is why there is so much complicated coiling in his pictures and techniques he shows. They are not always very practical and should not even be practiced until one has been taught the funndamentals of SHaolin Chin Na by a qualified instructor. I dont know about the practical applications book (which I saw, and it is alot thicker and has ALOT more than this one), but there are many different more practical styles of Chin Na. Most notable and VERY powerful are the Eagle Claw( which is pretty much all Chin Na) and Tiger Claw. Nevertheless, this is one of the only books like this, and Ming is an amazing kung fu practicioner.  
 As a resident of Chicago, I am grateful to the author for writing this book.  Now, I know where to have my knives sharpened, buy fresh ginger, and find the best teas 
 King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.  There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing.  For the most part, not bad.  Would make a good movie 
 word on the street is that some extra tunes are hidden on this DVD as easter eggs.. 
 Originally made for TV, Roma is a classic in the later Fellini style. Interspersed with typically hilarious autobiographical remembrances of the city, the maestro captures the incongruity of modern Italian society's imposition upon the historic significance (both ancient and 20th century wartime) of Rome. Worth catching is the cameo of the iconoclastic young Gore Vidal near the conclusion of the film 
 Great insights; worth the time and money; wateched it many times and always see something ne 
 ...boy was I surprised.   I was the first reviewer of Lonnie's book and when he gave me chapters I planned to read a couple of chapters and give him some feedback. I kept reading right through to the end and so will you.   Lonnie has a very engaging authoring style and a lot of real world experience that he shares in a meaningful way with many practical "take aways". This book will save you a lot of pain or at least remind you of some key things that are essential to getting the job done right. This is a valuable read if you're managing projects of any size.  You'll love Lonnie's humanistic approach to sharing his knowledge too...this is not your typical project management book! 
 Got it for Christmas and have used it several times since.  It replaced a Chef's Choice sharpener I got 12 years ago and still use. I have a collection of high quality Henkel kitchen knives and this sharpener has them razor sharp with just a few passes. Definately a worthwhile purchase 
 My contractor husband has decided this is mandatory viewing for all homeowners even thinking of building or remodeling their home! The film highlights some of the foils of building that perfect dream home, and trust me, not all of them are exaggerated. This is great comedy, even if it does hit a little close to home for those who have 'been there and done that'. I especially love Cary Grant's performance as the flustered husband trying to please everyone while stressed about coming up with a new advertising slogan for 'wham ham'. A slogan that is vital if he wants to keep his job. Wonderful classic!  Chrissy K. McVay - Autho 
 This is one of my favorite punk cds I've ever heard.  It's The Unseen, so we're talking fast street punk blasting you right in the f-ing face 
 I like to think of my self as a responsible driver but when I get a ticket for going over 10mph I get really ticked off.  I searched trough the internet trying to find a solution for these ridicules tickets and I found the reflector cover.  This stuff is amazing, I have seen a flash go off while I pass trough speed camera.  It's been almost 2 months and I still didn't get any ticket.  I think everyone should protect themselves with the reflector cover because the cameras are there to collect revenue instead of protecting the public 
 first off, as promised by the reseller, the book was in great condition.  as for the contents of the book, it's a fantastic read if you are interested in the root of the sustainability movement.  that is to say the foundations and meaning of our educational system which as critical public good, is in dire need of a re-examination 
 Perfect book for busy moms and grandmas who bake a lot. This is a great book if you have to do a lot of potlucks, school treats, etc. I like her other cake mix dr cookbook even better but her dinner dr book is awful.  Recipes are really good and so easy. Ingredients are easy to find and keep on hand.  Love all of her tips.  Good purchase. 
 This is truly the guide book to help you apply the masterful groundwork explained in Hudson's The Adult Years: Mastering the Art of Self-Renewal. Having experienced it's impact firsthand, I have used it in my work with countless leaders and coaching clients in my consulting practice with brilliant results for years. It is amazing to see the lights go on when clients see the life maps in the Adult Years and the 'fire return to the belly' when they work through LifeLaunch. Make the most of the next chapter of your life and read these books! Hudson has served as a master guide and inspiration to the who's who of the world 
 No teacher or student of Shakespeare can afford NOT to own this book.   I wish I'd had it when I was first confronted by the Bard. It only takes one tedious production to get off on the wrong foot. Like many people, I didn't know quite where to start with an author I was told was England's greatest poet and playwright. Thisis the guide I needed then.  Now, years later, I already find it indispensable. I have tested the book before seeing Shakespeare plays I did not know well: it works!   Early essays place Shakespeare in the context of the theatre and politics of his times. Later essays dissect his language and poetry in an highly illuminating manner. The heart of the book, though, ticks around Shakespeare's plays. Divided into genres, each play is deftly summarised  (with key speeches highlighted) and analysed from both theatrical and  literary points of view.   And making the Essential Shakespeare Handbook a true delight both to read and peruse, it is packed with illustrations of famous productions as well as of opera, ballet and film adaptations. To students and theatregoers alike, this book offers a key to loving Shakespeare 
 All of you who already know YLT wide musical affinities, will sure enjoy the last effort by the outstanding Hoboken trio. You'll find all sorts of songs in here, up and downbeat, but, trust me, all of them excellent. The LP runs 70' long, which is a lot, but keeps the level high all the way through.Understand me, it's not a mood album, like Electropura or Summer Sun are, but does pretty well the job, which is, delivering 15 pop-rock nuggets for the forthcoming fall winds. Don't miss it!    
 Except for the Little Brown Church in the Vale, it is hard to find anything of consequence to put on a viewmaster slide of Iowa, Bill Bryson's native state.  Directions are important to Midwesterners.  There is an absence of landmarks in middle America.    At Pella there is a tulip festival every May.  Speech in southern Illinois is more southern than midwestern.  The author drives to Oxford, Mississippi.  The students at the university there look serene, and it is impossible to imagine their parents rioting against the entrance of James Meredith. Tupelo is thirty miles east.  Columbus, Mississippi is a jewel.  In Columbus, per the COMMERICAL DISPATCH, the police don't have crimes, they have activities.  Next, passing through Alabama, Bryson is in Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Tuskegee.  In Auburn Bryson wonders why there isn't a decent bookstore since it is a college town.    The Little White House of Warm Springs, Georgia is of interest.  The cottage is snug and appealing.  At Lafayetter Square in Savannah there are brick paths, trickling fountains, and Spanish moss.  There are two hundred year old houses.  There is perfection.  There are one thousand historic buildings in Savannah.  Beaufort, South Carolina has mansions, too, and a little parrk and an marina.  At Charleston there is detailed Victorian ornateness.    In the Great Smoky Mountains the author stays at Bennett's Court, and old-fashioned motel.  The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most popular national park.  In Gatlinburg Bryson goes to the Ripley Believe It or Not Museum.  Mount Vernon is genuine, educational, interesting, unlike Williamsburg.  Delaware is the most obscure of all of the American states.  After visiting friends in Philadelphia and enjoying a view of Fairmont Park, Bryson has a good time touring the Eisenhower farm near Gettysburg.  He states a long bus ride in America resembles a prison stay.  He leaves his car in Bloomsburg with friends to go to the Big Apple.  Later he hits New England and proceeds westward to return to the midwest, Clevemland.  He drives to Toledo on the Ohio Turnpike, and then to Dearborn, Michigan.    The Henry Ford Museum is in Dearborn.  It is enthralling and the scale is breathtaking.  No cars or motorized vehicles are allowed on Mackinac Island.  In Nebraska the author looks for Winterset, birthplace of John Wayne, and Red Cloud for the Willa Cather connection.  Dropping down to Kansas to Russell, (Bob Dole), he finds that Dodge City is West.  Holcomb, IN COLD BLOOD, is beyond Dodge City.  Bryson dubs the Clutter murders grisly and sensational.  It seems that IN COLD BLOOD had been banned from the public library in Holcomb.  People hated the book.    Cripple Creek and some of the other famous places in Colorado now cater to tourists.  He visits St John's campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico to see his niece.  Nothing prepares a person for seeing the Grand Canyon.  Nevada is the state with the highest crime rate.  California yeilds recollections of television watching in childhood.  Sequoia National Park is an exciting prospect, an opportunity to drive through a tree.    Sun Valley, Idaho was built in the thirties, it seems by the Union Pacific Railroad as a ski resort.  Yellowstone is the oldest national park in the world.  Bryson believes Custer was an idiot and a brute.  There wasn't much to the Battle of Little Bighorn.  Bryson tries to eat in Sundance and discovers the restaurant has been comandeered by Shriners.  He travels to South Dakota to Mount Rushmore, seeing it is free, and moves next into Minnesota and Iowa, to his relief.  After Storm Lake, another college town, the trip is completed.    Parts of the book are very funny.                
 Oh wow one of Styx's most famous concerts for me to see whenever I please. When I got this I flipped out. I couldn't believe it. I was the luckiest man alive. I watched this thing over and over and over and I'm still not tired of it. 17 of their best songs performed live. I particularly liked "Rockin' The Paradise", "Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)", "Lady", "Show Me The Way", "Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)", "Babe", "Come Sail Away", "Renegade", "Lorelei", "Too Much Time On My Hands", "Snowblind", "Miss America", "Crystal Ball", "The Best Of Times", "Grand Illusion", "Suite Madame Blue" and "Boat On The River" those are my favorite songs on this DVD. This is a must have for any Styx fan whther you new to them or you are a seasoned veteran 
 Originally, I became interested in this book by reading an excerpt printed in Wired magazine.  Wired only printed the glossary of the book but that was enough to pique my interest.  In general, I think that is how the book  should be approached.  It is thought-provoking and interesting but should  not be taken too seriously.  It is certainly enjoyable, especially if you  enjoy Wired 
 It is just beautiful! Loreena McKennitt has a wonderful voice, and the way she displays it is just amazing! She's not one of those who seem to think their voice is much greater than it really is so they just scream all through the album, she uses her voice to harmonize 100% with the music. I find her music the only one I can listen to and concentrate and relax to at the same time, without getting bored. It works for all ages, all times of the day, anyhow, anywhere, anytime 
 I found this to be the best book on American history that I have read.  The author covers colonial history and then proceeds to address each presidential election and administration. There are many tidbits of information that I did not know or had forgotten.  These included: George Washington as president leading the militia to oppose the Whiskey Rebellion; a story told of the rotund President Taft giving up his seat on the trolley to three ladies; President Grover Cleveland being awakened by his wife who tells him there is a burglar in the house and his reply: no, in the senate maybe but not in the house.    The author has written an interesting and easy to read narrative addressing the negatives and positives of the different presidential administrations and their impact on America and it's future.  In general, an unbiased view is presented.I believe this would be a great textbook particularly for high school students. 
 It is a realy good book for beginner. I like this book 
 The author worked many years on this book. The pictures are simply amazing and cover the seven continents and 4.5 billions years. The author followed a mixed scientific/artistic approach and documented some selected life evolution lilestones through his pictures. For example, the very first picture representing the Big Bang is a zooming-in movement on the center of petrified wood in Arizona. The visual effect is great and to the point. The texts of the pictures (on separate pages - to make sure the pictures can be fully appreciated) is also very well crafted with a nice touch of poetry.  The book contains a fair number of references.  The binding of the book is also made with quality in mind. I don't suspect the pages will detach from the binding like some other similar books of this size.  Overall, I am really impressed. Actually, I wonder how they can make books of such quality at this price point. I paid lower quality books at twice the price. A bargain.  (This review is for the french version of this book, printed in Italy 
 As with most high school students, I was required to read and analyze "To An Athlete Dying Young." Its simple structure, elementary language and subject matter to which I could relate all made it one of my favorite poems at the time. Now, years later, it remains very interesting and drew me into A Shropshire Lad. I was curious to see the other material Housman published and was thrilled to find that all of his work shared similar attractive qualities. His poetry is accessible to even the most novice poetry readers (like myself) and clearly expresses complicated thoughts with beatiful language. Housman's empasis on the brevity of life, death and war are not happy topics, but they are realistic and it is valuable to consider his concise thoughts. I think this book, which essentially follows the life cycle, is full of fascinating poetry that anyone will enjoy, no matter what level you wish to analyze the material. It is a terrific collection 
 What amazes me the most about this book is how Ms. Chubbuck has a knack for understanding the human condition down to it's very core. It's not only remarkable but liberating. She helps an actor not only understand the character but BE the character because in essence it is you, a living, breathing human being.   As an actor starting out you don't necessarily have the luxury of picking your auditions & some parts you go in on it is nearly impossible not to judge your character then in turn making yourself "blow the audition" because either you don't understand or like the character very much (ie. prostitute, stripper, killer, cannibal, parent). Power of the Actor not only goes in depth to how to achieve being a character at it's most visceral element Ms. Chubbuck plain as day gives you constant references to her brilliance at work.   To either an untrained eye or sceptic, reading The Power Of The Actor might seem to have a lot of name-dropping but on the contrary what Ms. Chubbuck does in detail is allow her reader to want to jump off the couch, run to the nearest video store & check out the brilliant performance achieved by an actor she coached & the reader can see first hand how her technique works. How many books does an adult read & rushes out the door to do their homework? That's fabulous. Constantly Ms. Chubbuck refers to "the work". You HAVE to do the work & her technique not only teaches you how to do it, but allows an actor to enjoy it with such fervor & freedom.  Lastly, what I love about this book is that you don't have to be an actor to love it. It is once again her inate understanding of the inner workings of human beings & Ms. Chubbuck understands full-heartedly what makes us tick. I'd buy this book for a friend for any occasion, actually, I bought this book for my mother as a way for her to see the true art in acting & that I am not wasting away my life. Instead what she got from the book was how some of the choices she made in her life lead to some of the results she received. She too thought it was liberating, who knew Power Of The Actor could also double as a self help book? I wish this woman much great success & I commend her for the great risks she took in writing it. Buy this book, do the work & "Let It Go" 
 I was totally unprepared for this book.  I think I was expecting a trashy romance novel with a cursory Vietnam Prisoner of War theme thrown in for flavor.  What I got was a gut-wrenching page turner that truly captures the sacrifice and emotional turmoil of war.  Code of Conduct follows the career of a Navy fighter pilot from the downing of his aircraft in 1966, through seven years of torture and solitary confinement in the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison camp, to his return to America and his family.  But, after seven years of clinging to the dream, his homecoming is not at all what he expects.  Karen Black spins a tale of loss, emotional devestation, and - finally - healing.

 We have checked out a number of versions of The Three Billy Goats Gruff from the Library when my son was 4. This is the version he liked the most. It is very simple (as one reviewer uses as a reason to reject it) but for some ages, that simplicity is what makes it a favorite 
 Three Genres is an excellent resource for beginning to intermediate creative writing students.  It gives them the terminology they need to discuss written works and also includes many excellent examples in each genre. The book also includes some writing exercises, but the book is more of a scholarly resource.  I've used it in my creative writing classes at the college level, and I haven't had the problems that other users describe regarding the "Don't do" lists.  I rather like those.  They help students avoid some of the pitfalls of beginning writers 
 As usual this was a great one. Great from beginning to end. Maura, Jane and Gabriel are interesting characters. Highly recommend this on 
 This book provides a lot of laughs, and some understanding of basic Yiddish expressions for people who have little or no acquaintance with the language or its rhythms. The glossary is even funnier than the main text! In defining and providing context for each Yiddish word used in the book, the author might have done a bit better had he not gone quite so meshugeneh in flaunting his extreme left-wing politics, but still -- a  fun read 
 One of the first Westerns, with plenty of action and the romance of the west.  It features a rugged individual with a dark past, an independent and hardy woman who is in trouble and a cast of other interesting characters.    I think one of the reasons why we don't hear more about it is that most of the villians in this tale are ... (wait for it) ... Mormons.   So there is probably some pressure in various publishing houses, etc not to promote it. Zane Grey paints the LDS group here as patriarchal, polygamous ruffians.  You would guess that an early Western would use Native Americans, not Mormons, as the villians.  Anyway, if you are not offended by the choice of bad guys, it's a good story 
 I am a novice traveller, but yet a lover of history.  I purchased 4 books in these series to each place.  Great read both on the plane ride AND while I am there.  Does it have everything....no.  But, it is easy to carry and gives you a good frame to work with.  
 The book helps us to think about what our grandparents could have done in the past.  It makes us wonder about times before ours.  The character is funny and caring, easy to like.  The pictures help us to imagine what is going on.  A good book to read with family 
 Dr. Gunn Allen opens our eyes to the roots of modern American culture that are too often obscured, whether intentionally or not. A reader who approaches this work "in good faith" will be regaled with the astonishingly open, clear, and unique viewpoint she cultivates and communicates.  She chooses to stand between two cultures and knowledgeably observe them interpenetrate--rather than take the customary political or religious stances of taking one "side" or another. Only a woman with a solid grounding in both cultures (and a tremendous ability to write beautifully), as Dr. Allen has, can accomplish in her work what she is also showing her readers historically.  A discerning reader who is willing to admit--and agree to suspend--culturally-programmed judgment can come away from this book with a much richer, smarter, more beautiful and especially more genuinely compassionate sense of REAL purpose this country's citizens might choose to see in their ancestors' having come here, as well as in the direction they would really like this country to take NOW.  In addition, I find that it is an honor (still and despite the rude and terrible behavior the English showed towards the interesting and knowledgeable people already living here) to be so respectfully invited into sharing indigenous views of this world, this land, and the Western Europeans who came here. On top of all of this, the book is a truly great read for most anyone who has an intellect that enjoys exercise, and a love of exploring and rediscovering the past in new ways.  
 Anthony Weston has written one of the most useful books I have seen in years. In this slim volume he explains the rules to successful argument construction, beginning with the premise that an argument is not a disagreement, but rather is a collected series of statements used to establish the validity of a position.   While brief, the book explains in lucid text, readily grasped examples, and simple formulas the structure of logically valid arguments and also explains the nature of fallacies, and how to spot fallacious arguments.  I think that the most useful chapter in the book is chapter six, "Deductive Arguments." This chapter is mandatory reading for anyone who needs to understand logical reasoning, and is by far the most lucid and brief explanation of the six most common forms of deductive arguments that I have ever seen. The first three of these are fairly obvious, but the sections on hypothetical syllogisms, disjunctive syllogisms, and "reductio ad absurdum" (reduction to absurdity) constructions are somewhat less self-evident and should be thoroughly understood before proceeding with the remainder of the book. I also found the example of an advanced "modus tollens" (i.e., if p then q; not-q; therefore not-p) argument from astronomer Fred Hoyle regarding the origin of the universe and the one-way conversion of hydrogen into helium to be superior to (and more concise than) any other example of this construction I have seen in other books.   The final sections of the book deal with writing argumentative essays. This section is extremely useful to students, and I would recommend that students read this as early in their academic careers as possible (high school, possibly middle school for some students); certainly I recommend this to any college student: the lessons in the 87 pages of this book will enable a lifetime of discerning logic. Likewise, this book serves as an excellent introduction or review of basic logical argument construction for anyone, and is especially useful to people in careers such as law, labor negotiations, and journalism.  This is an excellent book. It is quick to read, but has powerful lessons. Keep it handy on your bookshelf.   I highly recommend this book.   
 Jon Faddis is the man!  This is one of the most well-rounded trumpet albums I've ever heard.  Not only that, it's probably the best album of the 1980's (okay maybe not much competition there).  Jon Faddis is absolutely insane as both a trumpet player and musician.  He pays tribute to Louis Armstrong beautifully, even quoting the introduction Armstrong recorded on "West End Blues".  His imitation is spot on, but he manages to keep his own instrumental voice.  He pays homage to Roy Eldridge on "Little Jazz", which is a classic in itself and Faddis plays one of my top five favorite solos on this tune.  "A Night In Tunisia" is yet another fantastic recording of the tune, although I feel Faddis overdoes the high register playing a bit on this tune, he still plays a nice solo.  Brilliant ensemble playing as well.  He delivers on his own tunes too, as shown in "Instigator", where he plays a crazy muted solo flying all over the horn.  Yet another tribute to Dizzy is "Things To Come" where he plays a great solo on an extremely fast pace.  This song definitely is given the Dizzy feel.  "A Child Is Born" is a nice, mellow Thad Jones composition.  This is great musicianship and Faddis solos over the whole song.  Some of the best flugelhorn playing since Miles Ahead.  Then he shows more amazing flugel playing on a fine rendition of Neal Hefti's classic "Li'l Darlin'", and a cool muted version of Benny Golson's "Whisper Not".  And how about the sidemen on this date?  Former Clifford Brown-Max Roach member Harold Land on tenor saxophone, young lion Kenny Baron on piano, the impeccable Ray Brown on bass, and the wonderful Mel Lewis on drums (co-leader and drummer in the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis big band).  Overall there is great playing from everyone.  Check out Ray Brown's bass solo on "West End Blues".  A classic.  Must-have 
 This book was such a sweet little something to come home to at night. This book isn't just for kids, but for adults too! relax and enjoy 
 Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in they forgot they were from different planets. Based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus has helped millions of couples transform their relationships. Now viewed as a modern classic, this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn't arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow. Don't be too surprised when you are reading this book and you recognize someone and some situation that is eerily like your own 
 These guys are the originals; the band that spawned 100 sound alikes. That is a compliment to them, but certainly not a compliment to how atrocious alternative radio has become. Make no mistake though. These guys were/are great, and this DVD collection gives you their best in living color. BUT BE ADVISED: The DVD collection has five fewer tracks than the CD collection. No big deal; a true fan has all of their songs on CD or downloaded. So the truly "new" release is this DVD. Following are the track lists of both:  The DVD: 01. Dammit (Growing Up) 02. Josie 03. What's My Age Again? 04. All The Small Things 05. Adam's Song 06. Man Overboard 07. The Rock Show 08. Stay Together For The Kids 09. First Date 10. Feeling This 11. I Miss You 12. Down 13. Always  The CD: 01. Carousel 02. M&M's 03. Dammit (Growing Up) 04. Josie 05. What's My Age Again? 06. All The Small Things 07. Adam's Song 08. Man Overboard 09. The Rock Show 10. First Date  11. Stay Together For The Kids 12. Feeling This 13. I Miss You 14. Down 15. Always 16. Not Now 17. Another Girl Another Planet 18. I Won't Be Home For Christmas  The DVD is definitely worth a purchase. The videos are mostly comically entertaining, and the music was inspiration for a generation of skateboarding, gaming, alt-punk rockers. Buy the DVD; skip the CD. 
 As a religious reader of Simmons' stuff online, I was sketpical about buying this book. The extensive footnotes, however, which contain added jokes, exponential material and goofy asides made it more than worthwhile. The fun of this collection wasn't so much in reading the articles again, but in learning what the author thought about them as time passed 
 Classics are so-named because they stand outside time and place, and speak to the dilemmas of being human.  This is one of those books.  There is a wealth of information on the follies of war, and its place in the grand scheme of happiness and love, tragedy, and life and death.    We see a cast of Napoleonic-era Russians as they struggle to work out meaning in their lives.   There are important insights on the nature of war and diplomacy.  The deterministic view of history that Tolstoy espouses herein is controversial, no doubt 
 Required reading for my MBA program. A short but good story. Interesting. Read in one day.  Recommend this book, along with "naked economics: undressing the dismal science" by Charles Wheelan and "The Undercover Economist" by Tim Harford. These books provide interesting reading to help supplement learning about economics. All three books are more interesting than economics textbooks filled with charts, graphs, curves, shifts, etc. 
 I got this cd when it came out, and it's taken me this long to feel comfortable giving it a 5 star review. Now here's my rationalization:  I feel a lot of tension over this record, in that the pain has run out. Misery's the bread and butter for artists, and the really tormented ones make awesome music, and either they die or their lives get much easier. Now, the kevins never said they were about pain. SP was more like the journey through it, the working out of problems. I point you to the song 'one day' on bites. I digress.   My point is, these guys have gotten over their big problems, and suddenly, they're in utterly new territory. If the record sounds boring, it's only that they are not in agony. They tried to leave some angst in to appease the fanbase, but this is a thin veneer. This is a very uncomfortable place to be, and it shows through the music.   However, i have the inane feeling that these men are the friends i never met, and this is how they are doing. Their happiness and honesty matters more than the continuation of a theme and mood. In this album i hear the birth of a new paradigm, a reformation of an old monolith. Key seems unsure of what to do. He's holding out, i've heard what he can do in tear garden. Melody, despite its simplicity, has finally found its way into ogre's singing. They are poised at the edge of something new, and i long for them to complete the crossing.  This record reminds me very much of summer. The songs are all vibrant and alive, and for the first time, they are all listenable. However, the 'guitar' in Pro test is irritatingly monotonous.   I love this record like an old friend, but listening to it makes me wish that they had gone farther. If they had committed themselves to a melody, if ogre were more confident in his singing. They come very close to this in use less and goneja. 
 Sid Heal, a recognized expert in our occupation, has managed to combine the lessons of the military's past into our present occupation-law enforcement.

Then, have your troops read the book so they, too, will have an understanding of their role in these situations.  The book shows the relationship between decision making, the preparation of a mission, and the actions taken to accomplish one's objective and/or goal to resolve the problem encountered.  Whether the objective is to handle a crisis or a critical incident, the principles are here.  "Sound Doctrine: A Tactical Primer" is a must read, for anyone involved in the decision making process for any crisis and/or critical incident, as it provides a means to accomplish a measured resolution based on "sound doctrine".

     Cendrillon, by Robert D. San Souci is a great book for kids.       Cendrillon is the caribean version of cinderella.Cendrillon's mother dies and she is handed over to her god mother.The god mother has the wand of manogany,wich can change things into another.       Cendrillon is a lot like cinderella and it is a great book.I liked it a lot.The book has a lot of detail and i thout it was funny when one of the step sisters said "The slipper will fit if you cut off your toes." 
 Bosch is back and finally diving into his mother's murder case while he's been place on involuntary leave. Our favorite detective is put through the ringer and has to come face to face with some rather ulgy demons from his past.  One girlfriend hits the road and another is quickly picked up on the rebound.  For a workaholic, Bosch gets around.  This time, however, our rebound chick has some baggage--then again-so did our last girlfriend.  Her husband was a psycho-cop.  So maybe he just attracts women with serious baggage.  Though this was another multi-layered and complex case, I was able to figure out the real killer pretty early.  But with Connelly, the journey is just as intriguing as the destination 
 When Bill Waterson decided to retire he left a huge void that is still felt today.  But along comes Mutts which help fills that void.  The drawing brings back visions of old style comic strips the humor is at times sly, subtle, and then outright hilarious and the comparisons to Charles Schulz and Peanuts is well earned.  Along with Zits and Baby Blues, Mutts shows that the comic strip form is still alive and kicking 
 This book is a must for those who feel that Church politics plays a roll in what is considered good and bad. For the person who tries to lead a Christian Life in a world where communications brings alternative views on just about everything, this helps with ones' personal holiness.  It is amazing how hard the Church comes down on those that disagree with it. Galileo is the most important example that comes to mind. Fr. Curran tries to use modern knowledge to question some of the teachings. That the Church preaches a united front is probably why Catholics in the United States do not follow some of the current teaching that do not really appear reasonable. It is not situation ethics it is a real attempt to be Christian and yet live in 2006. The United States, compared to Europe's practice of religion, is a country of saints but Americans do set their own course. Fr. Curran's book gives one a bit of hope that if one is pursuing another intelligent course than the Church united, they are not doomed to Hell.  
 I'm almost ashamed to admit that I have read "Musashi" by Yoshikawa and also watched Samurai 1, 2 and 3. Although I recomend both the book and the movies, in my oppinion they are limited by the fact that they were created quite a while ago and so leave out some of the graphic details. (Also, I read the abridged translation of Musashi, which undoubtedly removed some of the more graphic scenes from the original Japanese.) Vagabond on the other hand was created much more recently. It is a hi-resolution, modern retelling of the same story. All the best parts are in there, which means that the story presented is ultimately more realistic. Its especially enjoyable if you are already familiar with the story of Musashi. I'd say give it a try if you're curious enough to read this review 
 I am glad I read the reviews before ordering the boots.  I am satisfied with my purchase. My daughter needed the boots for a last minute trip east. A  majority of the reviews recommended buying a size larger and I am glad we did!  They definitely run small!  Can't understand how some of the reviews said they don't! My daughter wears a women's 6 and we ordered a 7.  She won't be able to wear thick socks, but they will do the job for this trip 
 I bought this book hoping that it will explain to me why some painters are so highly regarded and other copy caps are not. Book basically goes over mostly Renocence pictures and tell the story behind each painting either what it depicts in terms of symbolism or history behind it or resons and financing behind it. It is a combination History book and paintings. It tells yo that for example Boticelli's Birth of Venus is first in Ronecance for nudity but it does not tell me why her feet is crooked, why anybody else who probably did similar paintings at the same time did not get this much fame. That is what I was looking and could not find. Still looking for the right book but this book by itself is very good for the purpose of its design 
 arrived on time, item accurately described by seller, item packaged acceptably by seller, and would recommend this seller to a frien 
 as a sequel to fear nothing, this book is equally good. christopher snow is a very likeable character, so i'm hoping the talk of a trilogy is true. meanwhile, this is another one of those koontz novels that leaves the reader feeling a bit paranoid, which indicates to me that koontz has masterfully crafted his work. always the researcher, koontz successfully incorporated the military into this work without getting the reader bogged down in lingo. great read. just when you think things are okay, people are trustworthy, the situation is safe, you find out that you are wrong! very interesting look at possibilities 
 This book, along with Mastering Digital Printing, has taught me everthing I needed to know about getting excellent prints from my digital files.  There is some overlap between the two books, but it never hurts to have vital information repeated and reinforced.  I especially liked the sections on color management in this book 
 Ridiculous beyond belief? Yes. Fun? Oh yeah. The King of thriller fluff tops himself with this one. Put your brain on hold and you'll have lots of fun reading Deep Six. There is so much going on here it's amazing. And the ending is worth three Hollywood movies 
 Without a doubt, Gates of Fire was the best historical novel that I have ever had the chance to read and there have been many. The feeling of the Greeks courage and honor...and the tragedy that I knew would follow them was absolutely heart-provoking to me. Never have I felt more a part of the action than whilst reading THIS masterpiece by Pressfield. It took me three days to read it but that was only because I made myself put it down to prolong the experience!! 
 This is an excellent guide to learning and using your serger.  If you are a beginner and somewhat afraid of your new serger, this book will get you past that fear and on to using your new machine quickly.  It gives you clear directions, step-by-step, to help you begin.  It suggests keeping a notebook with notes of stitch settings and samples of your work as you try each technique, which I did.  It is very helpful when you refer back to it later.  As you progress in your skills, the book offers many other options and techniques to use in creative ways.  I keep it by my serger and sewing machine to refer to for inspiration.  And I continue to add new samples to my workbook.  The instructions are well-written and easily understood.  I like the line drawings because they are clearer than photos in the details they are able to show.  It does have a series of drawings in color to show the various seams and how they are formed, hemming options, and edge finishes.  If you are looking for a book to help you REALLY learn to use your serger, this is the one to choose.  It is straight forward, easy to understand and will soon have you moving beyond the basics 
 An excellent resource guide for the serious Mason who wants more than superficial rah-rah and to really understand the esoterica their lodges were based upon.  Leadbeater does a fine job at bridging the gaps.  Good reading 
 Some books can change your perception, but only a few can wipe out age-old assumptions, and force you to rethink everything you thought you knew. The question of RACE is at the heart of the American society, and in this book, not only African-Americans, but Americans of all colors, black, white, red and yellow, will find themselves reassessing what racism entails, for Malcolm X life, is a poignant testimony of the black man's struggle against both individual and institutional racism. This book has inspired many to answer the question of RACE in America on the institutional level, among them, The Black Panthers, CORE and many other Black Power movements. Thanks to Alex Haley, Malcolm X will be remembered as a man, who stood for what he believed, who lived the word he preached, and who fought oppression, "by any means necessary."  
 I'm sure this book is great, especially for someone who knows nothing about logic games. However, it wasn't too helpful for me since I had already taken a Testmasters prep course prior to purchasing this book. I bought it in the off chance that it would give me greater insight into the games, but I was already quite familiar with all of the material. However, I highly recommend their Logical Reasoning Bible, even if you have taken a prep course, for it is an excellent supplement. I definitely learned some new things from there and was able to raise my score in LR after going through that book.   With this book, I didn't really see an improvement in my LG. That isn't to say that this is a bad book, only that my prep course adequately prepared me in this section 
 John Michael Montgomery has asserted himself as a radio mainstay in the nineties.   Though he got little airplay since then--"The Little Girl" is the only hit I can think of--this album promises to deliver him back into the spotlight.   He has left behind the twang of his previous efforts, and has chosen a good selection of substantial, well-written and BELIEVEABLE material.  LETTERS begins with "Good Ground," an uptempo number about family and love that continues on most of the other songs.   The title track is a gut-wrenching number (admit it, you had a tear in your eye when you first heard it) that indeed stands out, but is not the only good tune on here.   "Look At Me Now" is a confessional number about growing older, while "Cool" deals with the consequences faced in life.     "That's What I'm Talkin About" is a romp that manages to skewer gossipers AND contain suggestive lyrics (a similar vein is followed on "Little Devil").   "Goes Good With Beer" is destined to become a honky-tonk classic, while "Break This Chain" is pretty much it's opposite--the story of a man from a long line of alcoholics praying for the strenght to defeat his curse.   "That Changes Everything" shows us the surprise directions life can take, while "It Rocked" lets us know that life's greatest moments and sensations come from the simple things.  LETTERS FROM HOME is easily John Michael Montgomery's best album.   While Montgomery has situated himself as frontman for radio-friendly music (ironically, big-brother Eddie is doing the same thing for outlaw country), he shows us that he does indeed know what a good country song is about...His voice is neither world-class nor run-of-the-mill, but he uses it for all it's worth, and it's worth a pretty penny.   LETTERS FROM HOME will make you cry, make you laugh, make you sing, and even--if you're really in the mood--make you dance.   A great album by one of today's best performers 
 I'm still working my way through this book, but so far it's given me a great deal of reassurance that I'm not alone in suddenly developing a "spare tire" at the age of 40, and it has also done much to help me understand that the same old exercise and eating routine I've followed for ages isn't cutting it anymore.   The few problems I have with the book include the author's irritating tendency to periodically stress that women "need" chocolate. It's almost as if she's projecting her own cravings onto all women - going so far as to write a book on this very topic; thus further perpetuating this ancient stereotype (the book sounds too absurd to even look into).   As she's taken pains to publish a work explaining women's biological midlife changes, drawing on (and greatly simplifying) scientific research to support her claims, this baseless, repetitive nonsense about chocolate has no place here. It's as scientific as stating "all women love shoes". I've found in my own experience that giving up all types of processed, packaged baked goods and sweets years ago has resulting in losing my taste for it. And, like many women, chocolate causes me to suffer from terrible migraines and flareups of rosacea. I neither love it or need it and haven't thought about in two decades. She would have done better to simply say that we tend to crave sugar more at this time, which is probably closer to the truth.   Moving on..I also noticed while flipping through the book another glaring factual error - one concerning vegetarian protein sources. The author states that it is necessary "to combine your beans and rice" to get a complete protein source. For years before this book was printed (1998) modern science acknowledged that this isn't true. As long as we get all of the amino acids we need in a day, food combining is totally unecessary. It's unfortunate that she didn't double check her facts before printing this misinformation. Frances Lappe Moore made this assumption initially in 1970, and her subsequent book some years later corrected the error.   Finally, since the book is directed at 35-55 year olds, and many of the women who buy it may fall into the lower end of that age range, the continual reference to being "menopausal" (I didn't enjoy thinking of myself that way, mainly because I'm nowhere near menopause) can be quite grating. Even though she does explain the difference between perimenopausal and menopausal phases of life, the "perimenopausal" references tend to drop by the wayside as the book progresses.   All things considered, I would still recommend it for anyone struggling with an otherwise inexplicable weight gain and other signs of midlife change.   
 Not having the appropriate scientific background, I can't attest to the validity of the science (though I'm waging a losing war to keep from calling BS on psychoacoustic vibrational sound therapy in general).  What I can say is it is very relaxing.    Is it more relaxing than, say, nature sounds or light classical music?  I don't know.  I would recommend the CD just because it is relaxing and leave it at that.  I'm ordering the classical CD set so I can try it during meditation and sleep (this one isn't for sleep, though people seem to be re-entraining themselves for alpha wave sleeping (snicker)) and because I like classical music.  I would recommend it if you're looking for some relaxing sounds 
 The only other book I have read by du Maurier was Rebecca, absolute ages ago. I never thought of reading her again till a fellow sci fi fan suggested I try it. What a wonderful surprise! Her characters both present and past were real to me, and the journey that Dick takes certainly time travel rather drug induced (which the doctor concludes).  Gave me some interesting things to think about along the line of what our mind holds from generation to generation and how reincarnation might just play a role. And I of course had a great urge to try some liquid in that vial!  I did have a problem at the end, which seems to suggest a very Freudian answer to all of this, and seems to conclude that it was all a hallucinatory dream. Sorry, don't buy it. It was time travel. Well, in my eyes anyway.  BTW I found that this author writes in a similar vein to Norah Loft, another historical fiction writer of the same time period. If you liked this book, you might want to check hers out as well, starting with Bless This House, in which she does some time traveling in a different sort of way. Also, with historical references, you might read Katherine by Anya Seton after this one, as the time period of the first is just after the latter 
 This book is it.  For an Interior Design student it is the only book I go back to again and again. It really helps with those beginning questions like... "how big is a standard king bed?"  "How high should kitchen countertops be for wheelchair access?"   Completely worth the price tag! 
 This language learning software is the best I have ever tried.  You can work with the Lesson material in several different ways, utilizing your favorite method of learning.  Expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor.  The package is well worth the cost 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I do not see the author as polemic or unfair. He provides reasonable arguements to back his claims. Perhaps he is somewhat harsh on Marcus Borg, but his arguements with the Jesus Seminar are certainly shared by many others (such as Meier). There are only two criticisms I would have: the writing is not as engaging as authors like Meier or Vermes and the book's value primarily would be to those who have read a fair number of the texts he references. To get a picture of Jesus just from this book and biblical accounts would be a mistake 
 This is definetly one of my favorite books! I've read it countless times and I also love the sequel 'Far Traveler'. The characters are all lovable and the plot is excellent. Another great thing about this book is it is partially a historical fiction novel. The author Rebecca Tingle wrote this book wrote this looking at historical notes. AEthelflaed was a real person and did many great things. Enough great things to be known as Lady of the Mercians.   Flaed is a girl that's only lived fifteen winters but her father King Alfred is making her marry a man named Ethelred of Mercia...a man that she's never met... He's also many years older than her. But Flaed must agree and her father tells her that she cannot be left alone any longer. She must have a bodyguard...a man named Red.   While Flaed and Red are together Red teachers her many things on how to defend herself. She learns how to ride faster and better (which will let her show off to her future husband soon), she uses the sword and many other things. But little does Flaed know that when she leaves for her new home trouble will follow.  
 Disney has outdone itself with this one! It's a story both dark and bright, sweet and sour that leaves you with a sad feeling of fatelity and a beautiful feeling of proper closure 
 This book is an excellent biography of Gates and that little startup company called Microsoft.   The book is well written, the story flows chronologically, detailing Gates' childhood in the 1960's, his fascination--bordering on obsession--with computers, and his relentless focus on starting Microsoft.  It is a fascinating story and full of parallels and insights for anyone starting a business in the technical field.  Nobody is perfect, we all have flaws, including Gates, but he did almost everything right.  He was focused, he had ambition, intelligence and he applied himself relentlessly.  When it came time to take risk, he stepped up to the plate more than once, and when the pressure was on, he didn't buckle under.  His detractors say he got lucky.   Well as a famous athlete once said, "the harder I practice, the luckier I get."  That phrase is applicable to Gates. 
 I never hesitate when it comes to buying a Muller book. Her characterizations are always right on.  You can close your eyes and see them. If I could write, she's the author I'd love to be when I grow up ( I'm 76 so I don't think she has to worry 
 Unfortunately the title, Anatomy of Greed, does not give the correct impression of what the book is about.  It is not the anatomy of anything.  This is not a dissection of the motivations and events that led to the collapse of Enron.  Rather it is a personal story of a low-level Enron employee framed by the public events of the end of Enron.  I found Anatomy of Greed to be riveting.  It is interesting on many different levels.  This is the story of the author's time working for Enron in Houston just before and during the meltdown.  Cruver is a young man recently out of business school and thrilled to be working for Enron.  A job at Enron is an immediate source of prestige and honor (and money), but soon Cruver realizes much to his horror and amazement that Enron is imploding.  At first there are hints in the air, then a rapidly cascading series of disasters.  I found Cruver's changing attitudes and the entire story of the unfolding of the Enron debacle to be utterly gripping.  Cruver was merely a munchkin who never personally knew Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, or the other witches, wizards, and warlocks of Enron.  There are no stunning new revelations in this book, but there many levels of interest.  Cruver tells what it was like on a day-to-day basis to be working for Enron on the trading floors.  And what it was like to be in the bunkers as Enron was falling.  Cruver also relates the responses of other munchkins.  (One exception:  Cruver was friends with one Enron higher up--a much older man who is described as a "family friend."   He is called "Mr Blue" in the book.  Cruver describes several conversations with Mr Blue which give a very negative slant on the events.)  There is the constant refrain of emails and phone calls from Cruver's friends (often starting with "Hey, dooood...") who are working in the financial industry.  So the reader gets the perspective of outsiders to Enron but insiders in the investment industry in New York on the dramatic news of Enron's demise as it unfolds.    There are many other aspects of the book that make it entertaining and enlightening.  Cruver is an interesting guy who is perfectly normal but just a bit cynical and self-deprecating.  I enjoyed his wry, but down-to-earth, humor.  Also surprisingly Cruver is no Enron basher.  He loved working for Enron and admired Enron in many ways.  I got the sense that he was more heartbroken than angry by the revelations of fraud and deceit among the executives.  Here he had his dream job with a top company, a bright, even glorious future, and unbelievably it all starts to dissolve around him.  What a story of disappointment!  Cruver and his fellow munchkins at Enron were no more greedy than the rest of us, and one cannot help sympathizing with their plight as they are caught in a morass that they did not create and do not even understand.  I was especially absorbed by the way Cruver is able to capture the intensity, excitement, and anguish of working for Enron in its last year leading up to bankruptcy and his life in the months after.  Although there are no new exciting tidbits about the Enron bankruptcy in this story, I did learn many things that I had not known before, or had forgotten.  This book is informative, entertaining, and absorbing.  I don't know of anything else like this about the Enron story.  This book must be read (or listened to) by anyone interested in the Enron story.  I listened to the CD which is very well narrated and well produced 
 This general history of the Mediterranean traces Mediterranean area history from its earliest geological roots to the civilizations which flourished later. Memory And The Mediterranean originally was written in the late 1960s but has been set aside until now, updated to reflect recent archaeological discoveries in the region 
 Robert J. Remini may be the most qualified author in the entire American Presidents Series. Remini is the leading expert on Andrew Jackson and Adams was president in the Jackson era, having been elected by defeating Jackson and then, losing his bid for re-election against Jackson. I was taken by the parallels between the Adams dynasty and the Bush dynasty. Both John Adams and George Bush were elected president after serving as vice president to a popular president. Both lost their bids for re-election. The son of both had the same first name but was known by a middle name; John Quincy Adams and George W. Bush. Both of the sons were elected in very controversial elections in which they lost the popular vote. Indeed, Adams was elected by the House of Representatives after getting Henry Clay's support in what was described as a "corrupt bargain" by Jackson's supporters. Bush's re-election broke the pattern of similarities since Adams, like his father, was a one term president.  Remini examines Adams' early life and notes that he was dominated by his mother, Abigail Adams. Her pressure lead him to become well educated and a perfectionist. He traveled to France with his father when the elder Adams was minister to France and he was educated there and became fluent in French. In raising his own three sons, he had very stern expectations of them and all three were disappointments to him. His pre-presidential career included a very solid term as secretary of state under James Monroe.  After losing his bid for re-election, Adams served in the House of Representatives and had a long, distinguished post presidential career. He was a staunch opponent of slavery and like his father, but unlike most other presidents up to his time, he never owned a slave. In a famous trial involving slaves who revolted on the slave ship Amistad, Adams was the attorney who defended them.  Today, we often get the feeling that politics has sunk to new lows of negative campaigning. However, the campaigns of Jackson against Adams were as dirty as they get. Adams was accused of arranging sexual favors for foreign diplomats in treaty negotiations and was labeled a pimp. Jackson married a woman who was believed to be divorced but, it turned out her divorce had not been final. When the error was discovered, Jackson and his wife corrected it and renewed their vows. This did not stop Adams' supporters from having a field day making vile attacks against Jackson and his wife, and labeling Jackson's offspring as illigitimate. Today's campaigns are relatively tame.  Remini is a great scholar who has written extensively about Jackson. Here, in this short book, he has written another fine biography. I recommend this book in particular and the other books in the presidential series in general.  
 Very quick delivery - my sons really enjoy this coffee and the sale price made it all the sweeter 
 To see a thing of beauty.A woman considered homely and boring that's so happy. Finding joy in a world filled with her average looks and job and boyfriend, she defies sociEty by being a star shining in the appropriate hour of need 
 The tshirt is great, my daughter loves it.  Unfortunately, it came 'dirty'.  Upon opening the package, we noticed a boot or shoe inprint on it, needless to say, we were very disappointed.  Now, how can they happen?  We called Customer Service and received a new shirt, but your shipping dept has someone who is willing to send an item like that--pretty sad.  
 Ben Kiernan, as one of the leading experts of this field, does provide invaluable information on the situation of this time. He gives an organized and relatively detailed view on several key issues such as the indentured agrarian state, the extermination of Cambodians due to ethnicity, their background, etc, and foreign intervention with major players such as the U.S, China, and Vietnam. However, I did hope he would go further in detail to the "Pol Potism" he refers to in several of his articles. The overall sense of identity and the changing sense of nationalism present in the regime is also perhaps, not as adequately touched upon.  In addition, the book is mainly for the academic audience who wish to learn more and perhaps do some research into the topic of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979. In addition, some general knowledge of the South Eastern theatre and the ongoing historical situation of that time is recommended for a more complete perspective. Furthermore, the book is not recommended for readers who wish learn more about Pol Pot as a person.  However, highly educational and still incredibly valuable as a resource, it is highly recommended (along with other key books) to readers who wish to understand the conditions and context of Kampuchea (Cambodia) from 1975 to 1979 
 You'd think, in a society that has come to accept one-parent families, one-child families would also be considered "normal," but, it turns out, that's not quite the case.  In "Parenting An Only Child," Susan Newman, a social pyschologist displaying extraordinary common sense, goes one-on-one with the prejudice and supplies any parent of "an Only" with enough ammunition to shut up anyone who dares look askance at singular offspring.  First off, she tackles all the cliches - that "Onlies" are spoiled, socialize poorly, blahblahblah - and makes mincemeat of them.  Then she lists all the advantages of having an "Only," including having enough money to feed, clothe, and educate them without resorting to robbery as a second-career.  And throughout the book, which, I've just learned, is an amplification and expansion of an earlier edition, she acknowledges "Only" pitfalls (such as the tendency to create the "state-of-the-art child") and devises pretty foolproof schemes to avoid them.  If you have 1 kid, are thinking about limiting your family-size to 1 kid, reading Newman will make you a better parent - and your kid a nicer kid 
 Kinhasa Zaire...1974...One of the most publicized and adored fights of the 1970s, and what better writer to depict the settings than Mailer. This book was a tough find until '96 when the legendary documentary, "When We Were Kings" was released. Mailer's descriptions of the fight throughout the film were compelling enough to make me search out his read.  Many people forget that the fight was postponed for two weeks by Foreman's camp, and the fight almost didn't go off, which leads to chaotic story. Mailer's settings in the Zaire heat and his descriptions of icons such as Hunter Thompson, George Plimpton, Jim Brown, and Don King roaming the lobby of Zaire's Inter-Continental Hotel are so good that you'll feel as if you've been thrown back for two weeks through a time-machine to 1974. A true time period when sports was straight-up for men's men  Now, I'm not so into the romaticized Ali depictions seen through the eyes of Michael Mann, 'limo liberals' and other misinformed academians, and I will never adopt the modern day pre-fabbed tributes to Ali. Accompany this read with a viewing of "When We Were Kings" or with a read of Thomas Hauser's "King of the World" and Mark Kram's "Ghosts of Manila", and you'll catch my drift.   Avoiding a Ali tribute, Mailer loves the sport of boxing, and it shows throughout the book. "The Fight" is a great read that depicts a chaotic time, Zaire, the characters and the life surrounding the classic fight.. Lead with a right-hand jab, and pick this read up. -BD 5/0 
 Clothes choices and fashion style often dictate the creation of the self  and its image: but how? Crane offers a somewhat scholarly exploration of  fashion trends from 19th century France to modern America, drawing  important links between style and social change. This approach will  interest not only art libraries, but schools offering social science  studies 
 I plan on taking this book to Italy when I visit Rome.  It's small enough and filled with so many details and close-ups of the paintings and other artworks.  For the price, it's a remarkable find.  I encouraged my students to read this book prior to our visit.  I feel they will have a better understanding and appreciation for what we will experience.  I highly recommend this book 
 This book is a bargain and especially useful for artists working in various mediums that want to include the ancient designs of Mexico. All of the motiffs are authentic and come from extensive research with such collaborators as Mexico's National Museum  and it's diretors and associated profesors. Numerous individual contributors, such as artists like Diego Rivera and Miguel Covarrubias have contributed their own personal collections for reproduction. The author, Jorge Enciso, first published this book in 1947 and it has been out of print for quite awhile, that is until Dover Press came out with a paperback edition. The designs are all magnificent reproductions of stamps used in various parts of ancient Mexico. Many of the designs you've probably seen before in artwork where a Mexican motiff is used but there are countless others that are unique and rarely seen. Intricate, geometric designs abound as well as drawings that feature the natural world and the use of animal figures both real and imagined. The decorative patterns are eloborate manifestations of the cultures of pre-Columbian Oaxaca, Veracruz, Azcapotzalco, Yucatan, Puebla and Teotihuacan amongst others. Many of these designs are still used in the arts and crafts that are produced in these areas.There are more designs than any one artist could ever use. These designs are useful as well as springboards for other ideas inspired by the ancient designs. Dover Press has given permission to use up to ten designs for any project without permission so any artist can use them without copyright infringement. A very handy book for people interested in preserving the artistic traditions of Mexico 
 Buy whatever Ajax primer you want, work with it, get excited about it, but before you use it in a real application, buy and read this book. Never expect to learn about a subject from a patterns book, just expect to leapfrog some painful learning experiences. This book helps you jump from experienced beginner to reasonable competence status without having to build a lot of bad applications first 
 _This is my sentimental favorite of Monroe's three books. It is primarily the accounts of the Gateway Program and its early Explorer teams. These were men and women selected by Monroe's organization to undergo training (largely centered around his Hemi-Sync technology) that enabled them to explore other levels of consciousness. This included visits with once-human and never-human entities in alternate dimensions and other worlds. It seems that the STI (Space Time Illusion) that we assume to be the "really real" world is only the tiniest part of the totality of existence. You are either going to be able to wrap your mind around this and accept it- or you will automatically reject it. In any case, as the book points out, all of us will cross over into at least part of this greater reality after bodily death- this is not a belief system or dogma. It is just that some individuals have the ability to consciously and lucidly explore those realms without dieing. In any case, we are more than our physical body.  _In the many accounts given of exploration and contact by Monroe and his associates it must be kept in mind that these are transcripts of translations from NVC (Non Verbal Communication) into human words. Human language is a very restricting form of communication and is not used at higher levels. There is also the fact that Mr. Monroe was a radio engineer and that much of his terminology reflects his training and colors his interpretations.  _The epilogue is especially informing- it is a concise and well-organized outline of the entire system of existence through all the various levels.  The first appendix gives an excellent set of questions and answers. The second appendix is an independent scientific study the OBE Psychophysiology. In the conclusion of the latter it is pointed out that Plato believed something very similar to this system. It also struck me as very similar to some of the more satisfying Gnostic beliefs.

 Very well written, fast-moving, intelligent dialogue among the main characters.  Very likable heroine (at times, though, I could have wrung her neck for not seeing what she had in Joe fast enough -- but that's just me); a totally "fall-in-love instantly" type of hero!!  If this were made into a movie, I could easily see Simon Baker as "Joe."  He has dreamy eyes and a drop dead gorgeous smile -- just like Joe.  Good book, fast read.  I only gave it 4 stars though because I would have liked to have read more on their "happily ever after..."  Didn't want it to end!! :- 
 If Sherwin Nuland hadn't already written "The Way We Die," Jerome Groopman could easily have used the title for this book.  Dr. Groopman specializes in cancer, blood-disease, and AIDs patients, so he is very familiar with the way we die.  His emphasis in this book is more on the spiritual aspect of dying, although there is also plenty of physical agony and degradation in "The Measure of Our Days."  If I had to sum up the book's theme, it would be: patients who love and are loved struggle hardest to live, sometimes way beyond the point where physicians have given up on them.  When they finally do die, their deaths are more fulfilling (easier? better?) than those who die with full wallets and empty hearts.  That sounds kind of hokey, like "Love Story" as written by a doctor, but Dr. Groopman handles the theme very effectively.  He's even slightly more optimistic than in his book "Second Opinions," although no one in "The Measure of Our Days" dies as romantically as Ali McGraw.  Just the opposite.  Most of Dr. Groopman's patients in this book die after extensive chemotherapy, surgery, and physical therapy--the whole painful and nauseous armamentarium of modern medicine (If it hasn't yet struck you how closely physicians resemble the monks of the Spanish Inquisition, you've probably never undergone chemotherapy. Both wield their instruments for our own good).  "The Measure of Our Days" speaks like a modern day Koheleth (Ecclesiastes):  "A man may have a hundred children and live a long life; but however many his days may be, if he does not get satisfaction from the good things of life..., then I maintain that the still-born child is in better case than he. Its coming is an empty thing, it departs into darkness, and in darkness its name is hidden..."  Change 'get satisfaction from the good things of life' to 'love' and I believe you will understand Dr. Groopman's measure of our days.  
 The Band is awesome. No doubt about it, but that's just it. They were a BAND. Robbie Robertson (spelling correct) somehow fooled the other Band members into letting him have songwriting credit (and Robertson got them to particiapte, against their better wishes, in "The Last Waltz" concert and accompanying film). Take a look at Band drummer Levon Helm's book, "This Wheel's on Fire," and he explains that Robertson and someone in the Band's management talked the group into giving Robertson sole (or majority) songwriting credit, so they all could supposedly benefit financially.  Robertson got rich, while the others didn't.  It's a shame, since Helm, keyboardist Richard Manuel (RIP) and bassist Rick Danko (RIP) all had better voices than Robbie's. There's also a great photo in Helm's book that has Helm showing Robertson how to play something on Robertson's Stratocaster. Great picture. It shows that it was a group effort, but Robertson and "The Last Waltz" film erronneously claim Robertson as the leader and chief talent. "The Last Waltz" concert was filmed by Martin Scorsese, Robbie's buddy. If Robertson truly was the lone genius of The Band, don't you think his solo work would have been much better? Also, in the words of the Arkansas-born Levon Helm himself, "Do you really think a guy from Canada (Robertson) wrote 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' all by himself?'

 Thomas McGuane knows much about fish, fishing and fishermen.  He also sees that the migratory fish is like a canary in a mineshaft.  If it dies,  the future of other even human life is threatened. Like the true angler he is more interested in the quality of his experiences in the fishing domain than in catching fish.  Like Falkus but unlike most other angling writers, he perceives and conveys to his reader that fishing is not a competitive activity (like for instance golf or bridge), but rather it is an opportunity for man to engage with raw nature and from that engagement to learn humility 
 "On the Outside" is a new follow-up to 2004's "Silence is Easy".   The band is really coming into their own; however, there are very few tracks which are "radio ready".  Be that as it may, Counterfeit Life, This Time, Keep Us Together and White Light are the stand-out tracks.  Finally, as an import:  the cd is "protected".    If you're on Windows, insure that you either hold the "Shift" key when you insert the CD OR (better) turn-off "Auto Play" of Audio-CDs.  If you're on a Mac, track one will be a bit jittery, but, otherwise things should be OK

 This book will change and revise much of what we learned in school. In this age of "politically correct" ideas, it is refreshing to read the true facts behind the important events in the U.S.A 
 What's in a word? Plenty, when that word is the adjective "free" in front of the noun "trade." The positive connotations of "free" have clouded the debate between free traders and those wanting to protect specific U.S. industries through regulation of foreign imports.   In "Myths of Free Trade," U.S. Rep. Sher rod Brown, the Lorain Demo crat, puts to work the con siderable knowledge he has gained through his efforts on the House subcommittee on commerce, trade and consumer protection to make his argument against untrammeled free trade.   He maintains that he is on the side of the angels, and that the mass public supports his views, no matter how often political and media elites label him an extremist know-nothing.   If leaders of our institutions would take the time to listen to people who work with their hands, they might learn something about the reasons for workers' anxiety, about the hopelessness with which many look to the future, and about social justice," Brown writes. "And they would see that unregulated free trade hurts more people than it helps - not only in the United States, but throughout the world."   Brown argues that an unregulated global economy does not automatically operate efficiently according to some magic formula of American capitalism. He goes further to say that the harm of free trade outweighs any benefits.   Those harmed include a Cleveland-area child "who eats raspberries grown in Guatemala by poorly paid farmers who use pesticides banned in the United States; the unskilled, minimum-wage worker in Los Angeles who loses her job to an unskilled, five-dollar-a-day worker in Yucatan; the machinist in New York who takes a wage cut because of his company's threat to move to China and the Chinese prison camp laborer; the tomato grower in Florida who has to sell his farm; and the peasant in Chiapas who must flee the native village where his family had made its home for dozens of generations."   Brown criticizes both political parties for what he sees as blindness to the facts and wonders about the gullibility of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, about economics professors, about journalists and about his colleagues in Congress.   Wondering about so many allegedly misguided souls, Brown can sound self-righteous at times. That tone, however, is ameliorated by the quality of his evidence. He might not be correct in some cosmic sense, and he might not convert anybody already on the other side of the debate. But his examples are plausible and well-presented.   "Our political leaders support - and excuse - authoritarian leaders in China and Indonesia because our corporate leaders have identified these totalitarian societies as ideal places to invest and reap huge profits, almost always selling back into the U.S. market the goods that slave labor or underpaid workers produce," he writes. "Big business has ignored or put aside Chinese human rights abuses, security threats, theft of intellectual property and loss of American jobs."   Trade policy is a hot-button issue when jobs come or go because of it. It is difficult, though, to explain the ideas undergirding trade policy. Here, Brown delivers information about an issue usually under the media radar.  
       Hole in my Life is a memoir of Jack Gantos's life of struggling with the proplem of never finding something to read or write about.

I choose this book becasue it looked like a interesting story of a guys life that has many struggles. I thought the book was interesting and a very easy read that always had something exciting or cool happening in it. If I had to rate this book out of 10 i would give it a 8.5-9, also I would recomend it to any one who wants to read a good easy reading book 
  Why people panned this movie on here I have no idea its a great action movie fast paced good scenes and shot great Snipes is the man 
 I really like the perma-focus attribute of this product.  We use it for nature watching while hiking and vacationing.  It's good to be able to pass the binoculars back and forth to others without losing the subject while adjusting the focus each time.  Only drawback is the difficulty in holding binoculars steady when viewing due to magnification.  Best binoculars we've had 
 A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 by Annie Leibovitz is one of the most compelling and heart tugging books I have ever seen. She has the most uncanny ability to capture every side of human nature, the sides whose images are forever singed in your mind - they are at the very least unforgettable and extraordinary.   It's her heart that you can just feel in her work. I've been a lover of photography my entire life. What makes this book so special is that it's so touching. I got chocked up looking at several of the pictures - it's that kind of photography, and the stories about the people she photographs that make her work what I call the pinnacle in human photography.   She knows there are many sides to a person, and she captures the side to convey the message that is the most real and poignant with soul-provoking images. That's what I mean by her work "taking you to your core" - She captures the soul of a person, and those frames capture a moment in time that remains eternal.   If there was ever a photographer who is as real and genuine as her work, it is Annie Leibovitz. GET THIS BOOK - there is so much in it that will open your heart to just how precious human lives are. Annie captures them all because her heart is what inspires her work.  Deserves a thousand stars, and more!   Barbara Rose, author of If God Hears Me, I Want an Answer! 
 In buying this album, I knew what I was in for, but also it gave me a good retrospective overview of the past present and future of progressive metal guitar. I would say that the Zappa and prog element is there enough with the shred/metal element to call much of Vai's solo material Prog Metal. He has a mastery of tone, melody (ok maybe not as much as Becker or Roth) and instrumentation that is probably on par with noone since Hendrix, since they both are in outer space as far as their unique visions. As Yngwie took Roth and Blackmore and surpassed them tenfold (well maybe not Roth), Vai has taken Van Halen in paticular (the liquid, spacey, tapping sound as well as other things) and taken it to another universe all together. A double album worthy of repeat listening and influence, Anthology sums up a killer career. The only thing missing is some of the David Lee Roth stuff. 
 Published in 1945, this novel, which Waugh himself sometimes referred to as his "magnum opus," was originally entitled "Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder."  The subtitle is important, as it casts light on the themes--the sacred grace and love from God, especially as interpreted by the Catholic church, vs. the secular or profane love as seen in sex and romantic relationships.  The tension between these two views of love--and the concept of "sin"--underlie all the action which takes place during the twenty years of the novel and its flashbacks.    When the novel opens at the end of World War II, Capt. Charles Ryder and his troops, looking for a billet, have just arrived at Brideshead, the now-dilapidated family castle belonging to Lord Marchmain, a place where Charles Ryder stayed for an extended period just after World War I, the home of his best friend from Oxford, Lord Sebastian Flyte.  The story of his relationship with Sebastian, a man who has rejected the Catholicism imposed on him by his devout mother, occupies the first part of the book.  Sebastian, an odd person who carries his teddy bear Aloysius everywhere he goes, tries to escape his upbringing and religious obligations through alcohol.  Charles feels responsible for Sebastian's welfare, and though there is no mention of any homosexual relationship, Charles does say that it is this relationship which first teaches him about the depths of love.  The second part begins when Charles separates from the Flytes and his own family and goes to Paris to study painting.  An architectural painter, Charles marries and has a family over the next years.  A chance meeting on shipboard with Julia, Sebastian's married sister, brings him back into the circle of the Flyte family with all their religious challenges.  Three of the four Flyte children have tried to escape their religious backgrounds, and this part of the novel traces the extent to which they have or have not succeeded in finding peace in the secular world.  "No one is ever holy without suffering," he believes.  Dealing with religious and secular love, Heaven and Hell, the concepts of sin and judgment, and the guilt and punishments one imposes on oneself, the novel also illustrates the changes in British society after World War II.  The role of the aristocracy is less important, the middle class is rising, and in the aftermath of war, all are searching for values.  A full novel with characters who actively search for philosophical or religious meaning while they also search for romantic love, Brideshead Revisited is complex and thoughtfully constructed, an intellectual novel filled with personal and family tragedies--and, some would say, their triumphs. n Mary Whipple 
 I liked this offbeat book. Both the subject matter and author were interesting. The book is about a kooky history buff that visits sites surrounding the Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley assassinations. I listened to the book on tape read by Sarah Vowell the author. Sarah's voice seems to match her personality to a "T", a little odd but interesting.   Sarah is a bit eccentric, she doesn't drive, is afraid of heights, is fascinated by the historical macabre, and she sounds a lot like Yeardley Smith. If you don't know who Yeardley Smith is then buy a TV. Yeardley has been in a few movies and television shows but is probably most noted for her voice of Lisa Simpson. I digress.   In any case, I found Sarah's idiosyncrasies and ties to current political situations an asset to the book. But I love horror movies and historical fiction so it may just be me even though Steven King has a short speaking role in her audio book version. Her description of John Wilkes Booth as "smoldering" seemed odd at first but gave me a better mental description of the man then if she had just described his facial features alone. It was also honest. You know someone is giving you there honest opinion if they are willing to admit that they think the man who shot Lincoln was a little hot.   In summary, read the book, or better yet listen to the book, if you are at all interested in Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley and the places and events that culminated in and surrounded there assassinations and assassins or if you like offbeat storytellers who are a bit morbid. I know I do. 
 When I considered subscribing to FT last year, I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't any recent reviews on it.  So here we go...  I subscribe to both the Wall St Journal and Financial Times (FT), and have in the past subscribed to The Economist.  For comparison's sake, the WSJ is very good in its section one coverage, especially front page stories, political coverage, and its excellent and frequently quoted editorials.  For me, the other stuff is fluff.  Regarding the Economist, it is a highly touted weekly newsmagazine with two downfalls (and reasons why I cancelled my subscription) - it is weekly (!) and seems to interject alot of commentary into its stories.  Which leads us to the FT.    With FT, I feel like I'm reading THE NEWS, and more importantly, it is in a daily format, ensuring you'll be up to date on the latest global news.  There is excellent coverage of US happenings, along with Europe and Asia.  Once you read it, you feel much better informed - where else can you get daily extended coverage of the Russian/Ukraine natural gas issue or, from several months ago, daily coverage of Germany's elections?  Along with excellent reporting comes great, although somewhat left/liberal commentary - don't let that dissuade you, however.  Other gems include business reporting, including stories on management ideas, business life, etc.... and the most excellent Weekend edition (Saturday), full of all sorts of cultural stories, including food, wine, arts, book reviews, travel, and the like.  Not too mention awesome columns by Lucy Kellaway, Martin Lukes, and Tyler Brule.    You must pick this up and indulge yourself for a few weeks, if you are undecided.  You will not be disappointed.  Reading and owning the FT is a must. 
 If  you're sufficiently interested in the Brooklyn Bridge to read something book-sized about it, let it be this book.  By the same token, no single book and necessarily suit everybody's needs which explains why some people below complain that there is too much social history, too much engineering detail, or even not enough engineering detail.  Heck, if you want to dig deeper onto any aspect of this book there is a fine bibliography in the back of it, and an amazing amount of the historical materials cited in it can be found on the Web if you know how to search for it.  One other suggestion: treat yourself and buy the Dover picture book "A Picture History of the Brooklyn Bridge" as a companion to this one.  Even though the selection of photos in the McCullough book is more or less generous, the broader coverage of the Dover book helps you better visualize more of what is in the book 
 I purchased this book with every intention of reading it but after almost a year I had not gotten to it.  Fortunately I was able to get the entire work in an unabridged version on audio cassette.  The subject covered was one that was hardly new to me.  However, Goodwin takes a unique and fascinating perspective that allows the reader or listener to actually feel that they are a part of history.  For those who don't have time to read, consider the audio version. It's well worth the listen 
 I am so thrilled to see that this book is still in print.  When I was a child, I used to read and re-read an originally published copy (still called The Fairy Mythology then) in her dusty, musty library.  I've searched and searched for the book, not even able to recall the title until the other day, when I typed in the original title and came up with the re-print.  What a wonderful treat to know that I will be able to own a copy again.  It completely cast a mysterious, magical spell over my adolescence.  You will love this book.  
 B. B. King is more than a talented musician and songwriter, he is a phenomenal entertainer as well.   He works a crowd like few others with his obvious love for people and his devotion to giving his best.  This album captures BB as he is best, live and in action.  He does not need light shows or other props to sell his work, he just plays and sings with a style and an infectious joy that few entertainers can match.   One of his best albums 
 Somehow, 175 years after it was first written, this story keeps holding our attention. Not just that, it says more to our modern world than it ever said before.  Popularized versions of this story lack all the depth of Shelley's original. Yes, her monster was physically huge, powerful, and respulsive. In her version, though, he's a thinking, feeling, and deeply intelligent person. He is deeply hurt by the universal, unreasoning loathing that judges only his face - even from the man who created him. The creation has a majestic capacity for affection but, in a credible transformation of emotional alchemy, that whole capacity turns to rage. He is not an image of hate, but a mirror of it.  The hubristic biotechnologist has an immediacy today that Shelley could scarcely have imagined. So, I think, does the vengeful lashing out by people who feel they have suffered grievous wrongs, leading to a deadly spiral of increasing hatred by all parties. I just hope that current readers will take the time needed to absorb this book properly - it was never paced for today's ADD-driven generation.  //wiredweir 
 "Executive Values" clearly presents the pressures and seemingly conflicting responsibilities experienced by those in positions of management and leadership. A Christian approach to solving these dilemmas is presented in logical and humane ways. Kurt Senske gives much evidence that the "bottom line" is not the highest priority. Not only will CEOs and other executives be interested in this recommended application of the Golden Rule, but I also urge the church professionals - pastors, school administrators, youth leaders - to give it serious attention 
 Fantastic book. Written for the lay person in words and terms a non-medical person can understand. Encouraging, informative, doable. Great book. Thank you 
 With exquisitely detailed black-line drawings, this book shows how the pyramids in Egypt may have been constructed. A two-page introduction gives some background of life in Egypt, including an overview of Egyptian spiritual beliefs and practices, especially those related to death and dying. The introduction makes clear that this book is based on an imaginary pharaoh and an imaginary pyramid and that there are differences of opinion about the construction process the Egyptians used.   After the brief introduction, the illustrations dominate, comprising as much as 80% of the pages. Almost like time-lapse photography, readers can see the pyramid grow in vast landscapes, giving children a good sense of the scale of the pyramids, where people are just specks dotting the sides of the massive structure. In addition to these landscapes, Macaulay includes background on the people who designed and built their pyramids and their techniques with illustrations of the different workers and their tools, as well as architectural floor plans and cutaway diagrams.   The text is difficult and presents challenges with its vocabulary and syntax as well as its concepts. A one-page glossary of Egyptian and architectural terms provides some assistance. However, the account of how the priest uses the stars to locate true north is a difficult concept to comprehend; the textual and pictorial explanations may not be sufficient for any but advanced readers.   Though the text and many of the concepts are demanding, young readers will be carried along by the drawings that truly offer a step-by-step guide to how the pyramids were built. The distant and perhaps "quaint"-seeming aspects of Egyptian beliefs and practices are nicely contrasted with their highly advanced, ingenious construction techniques. Children familiar with some aspects of ancient Egypt will perhaps be able to see the "bigger picture" and gain insight and appreciation into the culture of the ancient Egyptians. Younger children will enjoy following the process and watching the pyramid grow from page to page, while older children interested in the "how's" behind history will appreciate this novel approach to learning about ancient Egypt 
 Loved the book. It confirms so many of the lessons taught to me by my dad and by life. So much of what passes for decision-making in daily life is based on unfounded biases and thoughtlessness. But I digress.  A quick story about arbitrage and the key point that the authors make in Chapter 14 -- a story that causes the zero-sum gang to gasp and talk about unfair mercantilism. In our family, there are 4 boys. When we were young adults, the tough question at Christmas was what to get Mom and Dad, who were particularly difficult to profile from a gifts perspective. In addition, certain of the 4 boys were geographically inconvenient and would fly long distances to make the holiday celebration/x-mas day.  So, if one of the boys came up with the perfect gift for one of our parents, said brother would offer to syndicate gift credit to his brothers. If the gift cost (say) $50, the other brothers would be offered a 1/4th share for $20/each. If all 3 non-buyers participated, the sponsor would receive a $10 profit plus gift credit for doing the legwork and delivering the gift, wrapped and ready.  To me, this solution worked great, in particular as the parents were more interested in quality, thoughtful gifts than quantity. Talk about a win-win -- the approach even motivated the youngest in the crew (me), with the least disposable income, to work the hardest to come up with syndicatable gifts!  Others who have heard the above story have recoiled in horror about such rampant mercantilism and non-holiday spirit. How they miss the boat.  Thanks to the authors for a wonderful, practical, enjoyable book.  Rob Glanville 
 Sandra Steingraber is my new heroine. Her writing is magnificent, and her concerns very much my own.  She manages to explain the inexplicable (we are poisoning our babies, and don't stop even when we see the evidence) in a way that does not frighten as much as persuade. She indeed has  faith, and I am so grateful to her for facing these fearful realities during her pregnancy -- as she points out, if pregnant women don't face these things, who will? Her refrain "We shall not abstain" -- asking why it is  pregnant women who must restrict themselves, not producers of toxics -- is common-sense political brilliance and unmasks the hypocrisy of a society that pretends to protect the vulnerable with technological might, but is really not interested when facts run counter to the fantasy of omnipotence. Her writing is so vivid that I burst into tears at the end of her labor-and-delivery story, as I do at any filmed depiction of birth. Thank you, Sandra.I'm giving it to all my friends, and sending it to some politicians 
 Have watched this movie no less than 20 times.  Love it everytime I watch it....just love Sandra Bullock, and when you mix it with Harry Conack you can't beat it.  You will love it if you are romantic at heart!! 
 Jill and Cyndi have provided us with an easy-to-read and easy-to-follow guide that just about anyone can put to use!

With all of the formulas and tips they provide, there is inevitably something for everyone!  It's Your Move makes you feel good about yourself and it makes you want to go out there and do something great with your life! 
 this tea while a bit pricey, is excellent. Hint of Jasmine and full aroma make this tea a good choice for a special occasio 
 The title of the book suggests time does not exist. The justification is a certain solution to Einstein cosmological equation, where the universe is rotating and time travel is possible. A path could reach into the past going around the universe.It is the Godel solution.  Modern cosmology is based on the Robertson Walker metric , or model,where there is a universal time. It fits the obseved universal expansion.The universe was born in a big bang fifteen billions years ago.  Goodel gave too much importance to his solution. After all any equation can allow many mathematical solutions which bear no relation to physical reality or fact.  The book is good reading with old and rare photos.It compelled me to reread "The Godel Solution" in Adler ,Bazin and Schiffer General Relativity. Early in the century,Kurt Godel had laid a golden egg with his incompleteness theorem, pertaining to pure mathematics, causing some stir among Hilbert and Russell.But his attempt to abolish time, much later in 1949, felt in deaf ears among physicists and cosmologists.This is not about to change any time soon.  Yourgrau does an elegant work in rescuing an old story.It takes us through Europe and the beginnings of the Princeton Advanced Study Institute.   
 THE HUDSUCKER PROXY soundtrack is a wonderful mix of Carter Burwell's original score and his arrangements of some of Russian composer Aram  Khachaturian's most famous themes.  Burwell's achingly beautiful original  music and his arrangements perfectly match the mix of silly and sharply  satirical elements of the film.  I highly recommend it. 	The first  three tracks aptly illustrate the main elements of the film and the music. 	 "Prologue" uses Khachaturian's adagio from his ballet SPARTACUS.   It immediately sets the dreamlike quality of the film with its sparse  orchestration which slowly builds and thickens to a full, grand orchestral  swell.  It's a very good adaptation of the work. 	"Norville's  Suite" illustrates the character's friendly, naive personality.   Happy-go-lucky in style, it shows the exuberance of his youth. 	 "Waring's Descent" gives an idea of Burwell's lush approach to  the dramatic scenes of this film.  The frantic sound in the soprano's voice  add an urgency as the track progresses and closes. 	  You won't be  disappointed by the quality of Burwell's work on this album.  The only  reason I didn't grace this album with five stars is because of its length.   However, the approximate half hour of music that is on the album is more  than worth the purchase price 
 My daughter loves this toy.  We bought it for her birthay, and her ponies have been dancing ever since.  It is very cute, light up, plays music, and is very compact and durable.  The only downside is you will have the My Little Ponies theme song stuck in your head for days.  Hee, hee 
 I LOVE THIS MOVIE SINCE I WAS A KID. I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT ON AMAZON...I DIDNT EVEN FIND IT ON E-BAY.THE SHIPING WAS VERY FAST.   
 Everyone knows someone - whether a roommate, a friend, a brother or even himself, who has a particular fondness for Asian women - but no one ever talks about it in public. As an Asian American woman who grew up in the mid-West, I can tell you that I'd be rich if I had a dollar for every time someone like this tried to hit on me just because my face is Asian, and yes I have even dated some of them. This is a constant topic of café talk with all my girlfriends - no matter whether they're Asian American, white, Latina or black. (Even Hollywood has told many tales about this - from the recent Memoirs of a Geisha to the ancient World of Suzie Wong). Yet unless, we're speaking to girlfriends, other Asian Americans or friends-in-the-know, the subject falls on deaf ears. No one has ever written a balanced, truthful and in-depth analysis of this before. Finally! I'm so amazed that this book was written.   Why hasn't anyone written about this before? Perhaps it's a hard concept to grasp - no doubt because as the book says, the Asian Mystique is so captivating that most people don't even know that they've succumbed to it. This may sound complicated. Indeed, whenever my girlfriends and I gossip about those kinds of men who like Asian women, we often cringe. But do we ever stop to think about why? Without burying the reader in obtuse, academic jargon, Prasso finally gives a name to this cultural phenomenon ("the Asian Mystique") that allows room for true discussion (It's much more productive than "yellow fever"). Not to mention the fact that the book is a page-turner and packed with great statistics and interesting data. Like an anthropologist, the author quietly observes all the interesting details without criticizing. Because she does not make judgments about the people involved in Asian-Western cross-cultural relationships, I found myself thinking about it in a new light. Not only that, I feel that she really did her homework in trying to understand the aspects that we in the west misunderstand about Asian culture (yes Asian Americans are guilty of this too). This is not an easy thing to do, especially for someone not raised within Asian culture. Thus, I must also applaud the author for trying to write a book that rises above a particular agenda in order to thoughtfully explore the very complex intersection of race and culture with desire and love. This book this goes a long way in explaining centuries of cultural misunderstanding. For anyone who cannot deny the growing influence of Asia upon the West, this book is a must read. As China moves head on into the world stage and we in the West embrace this with both dread and adoration, it would be wonderful if everyone could read this book that dissects the heart of this cross-cultural conflict - relationships between Asian women and Western men! 
 "The streets that Spin Off" should be enough of a reason to own this album.  Adam knows how to write a song and he has shown that time after time. His guitar playing is unique and is always tastefull. Help Toshak Highway since Swervedriver was ignored by the record insustry and most of the public!!! Never Loose The Feeling!  
 For anyone that finds differential equations beautiful; for the theoretical scientist in whatever field; this is nearly as indispensable as Abromowitz and Stegun (The Big Ugly Blue Book) 
 Wow! This book is really amazing and life changing for me--and I think for anyone who would be willing to go through it. It's amazing...It's not preachy, it includes personal insights and experiences by Joseph Campbell. I think everyone should read this book 
 Although I suspect that most people who will read this book already know how BIG Babe Ruth really was to Americans, I wish those who do NOT realize his profound inlfluence on modern culture would take the time to check this out.  Creamer has fashioned an extraordinarily readable, concise yet fully detailed biography of this great ball player. There is enough journalism here to satisfy those seeking accuracy, enough analysis for those interested in perspective, and enough elegant writing to please pretty much everybody else.  Beginning at the beginning, and ending, abruptly, at the end, Ruth's life is presented within a vivid portrayal of early 20th century America. His tenacity, exuberance, lust for life is all here, including many unflattering incidents. Warts and all.  If I had to single out the best things about this book, I'd have to start with how Creamer places Ruth's achievements into context. Staggering and astonishing are the two words I keep coming up with. Winning the Home Run Crown is one thing. Winning it over and over again for nearly two decades is another. Setting a home run record is one thing. Doubling the record is entirely another thing.  It took forty years for Maris to break Ruth's record by one. When Ruth broke the record the first time, in 1919, he broke the old record by three or four, hitting 29. The next year, 1920, he hit 54. He averaged 40 a year for SEVENTEEN years.   Before Babe, the all-time home run king hit 136 homers. Ruth passed that in his first few seasons as a full-time (non-pitching) player. Every homer he hit after that extended it...when he hit 700, only 2 other players were in the 300's.  And don't get me started on his pitching. Wait till you read about how good he was. I had always known he was a pretty good pitcher...I didn't know he was THIS good.  The name Babe Ruth is synonymous with "legend", and there are hundreds of legendary tales surrounding his exploits. Creamer sorts of fact from fiction, and most of time, the fact is the legend.   For example, the "called shot" may or may not have happened. The events that we are certain that occurred during that game are still amazing.  Plus, I prefer to believe that he hit a ball so hard that it went between a pitcher's legs AND over the center fielder's head. I just love that mental image.  There is a lot of sadness in Ruth's life, from his relative abandonment as a child, to his inability to become a big league manager, to his vitality-robbing cancer...his life had ups and downs like only true epic characters can have.  The book also gets Ruth's media domination right. At least it feels right. I wasn't there. Most of us weren't. But baseball was the only entertainment for the majority of the country, along with those relatively recent upstarts, radio and film...there is nothing today that really compares. There is really no one person whose personality captivated a country like his did.  And it sounds like he loved every second of it.  After reading this book, I would give anything to see Babe Ruth play just once.. 
 "I have shooting pains in my upper left arm." Said the pilot to Brian.  Brian is the main character in the book Hatchet. This book would be for someone who likes survival in the wilderness or even just survival. I like this book because I am into this type of writing. I think Gary Paulson is a very intelegant man because.....who could have thought of a book about a boy who his plain crashes into the Canadian Wilderness and.............Do you think he survived the wilderness?.........HE DOES SURVIVE THE WILDERNESS!

 Conflict prevention titles usually focus on ideology and politics, but a more comprehensive overview is taken in Rethinking The Economics Of War: The Intersection Of Need, Creed, And Greed. It crosses disciplines in considering all the different influences on war decisions, it goes beyond economic consideration to discuss cultural identity, grievances, and income gains from war, and it provides scholarly, college-level essays which pinpoint greed and discrimination as primary causes of war within states. Essential for understanding some of the real origins of war. 
 I have read the last five editions and everyone of them has been worth its weight in gold to me here in Costa Rica. However, this edition is the best ever. I recommend it to anyone who is going to make the move or invest here. Words can't say enough about this time proven product.   I've also been on two of Mr. Howard's retirement tours and found them to be very helpful 
 Yes, it came as quite a surprise when I learned Carla Bruni was a supermodel; let alone one with such talent!  The album is wonderful from beginning to end, and I've yet to become tired of it even after three months of almost continual play.  I also may be bias as I'm currently learning to speak French, but I seem to pick up something new every time I listen to it.  Great for the learning experience because the words are clear and concise to a moderate beat.  A good buy, and definitely worth listening to if you are willing to expand your horizons 
 This is a great album--the pace is very driven and the lyrics are smart and catchy.  I especially liked the fast paced and intense Watching the Rain.  I look forward to more good works from Katy 
 History, gossip, antecdotes, quips and quotes about some of the world's most fascinating women and the men who loved them. Sample quotes: "No man who has an account at Cartier's could be regarded as ugly." "Dates make ladies nervous and stories dry." "I hold everything which is not love to be mere dull intervals in life." And "It is strange that we courtesans should alone be worthy and able to converse with philosophers. 
 If you are a Smallville fan, as i am you will love The Talon Mix. Also by putting the disk in your ROM drive you have access to the town of Smallville and more........  If you are in to Smallville you will not be disappointed with this purchase. I think it is excellent and so i am giving it five stars.  
 In this book Lasch defines a cultural reality and reveals a concept the Western world is living with, and to a degree suffering from today ' cultural narcissism'. Lasch saw that the whole culture built around ' self - centeredness' is less than healthy. He saw that the focusing of ' the me generation'on themselves led to a more fragile and broken America. Those willing to put themselves first and nothing else second were  the same people who broke marriages easily, readily used friends and discarded them.  Individualism carried to extreme and self- indulgence upon which no limit is placed are the heart of the culture of narcissim that  we are in some sense still living with today 
 This film cracks me up! I have watched it numerous times over the years and I still find every scene just as funny as I did the first time I watched it!  Two families come together to make this a great film. John Candy plays the kind, caring family man out to enjoy a family vacation with his wife and two sons at a cabin out in the wilderness in an area he enjoyed staying in as a boy with his family. Dan Aykroyd and his wife and two daughters decide to surprise Candy and his family by joining them on their vacation. Candy's character and Aykroyd's character are brother-in-laws and they are complete polar opposites in every sense of the word. Aykroyd's character is an annoying creep that thinks he's better than the next guy and is always doing the oneupmanship thing whenever he can. Mix Aykroyd's character and that of Candy's character and you have one laugh after another! Sit back, watch and enjoy this film 
 This is probably the best album ever recorded.  I've worn out 2 cd's.  I have a collection of 3000+ cd's and this is the one I pull out all the time.  Classic songwriting, great guitar solos, a wonderful cover.  Mike Ness is great.  I know that's an understatement, but thank God he keeps doing it right.  White Light and Sex Love and Rock n Roll are just as good so be prepared for a life changing experience 
 Very nice edition of the master's novels.  In addition to my love of Hammett's prose, I am fascinated by the subtle political aspects of his work: he was the first crime writer to question the status quo so frankly.  K. C. Constantine said, "The crime writer is society's stoolie", and Hammett is still a reliable informant 
 This book is awesome and should be required reading for everyone. Yes, it's written by a priest, but the 'religious' references are minimal and don't in any way detract from the message of the book - unless you choose to let them do so.  I've given many to friends and will continue to do so ... very powerful message, yet easy to read, understand and apply the principles.  An immeasurable gift to give to yourself or to others 
 This book is almost a course in artistic photography, from page one to the end. Her "de-focusing" technique is superb, it metaphors "a-temporality" or the aeternal as most of her work. Her subjects and themes are very  original and the color section is astonishing.  Do not miss the opportunity to have this jewel on your library 
 Generally I like my books fast and plot-driven, with minimal description and at least quasi-linear plots lines. While Invisible Cities is none of those things, I would rate it among my favorite books. The prose is incredible, rich, almost erotic. At times I felt my heart beating faster as I read it. This is a book to linger inside of, to re-read often, to keep by your bedside to read snatches of before you go to sleep. 
 This is a truly awesome collection of DVD entertainment.  For those nights when NOTHING is on TV, now you can watch exactly what you really want!  Your girlfriend!  You go girl 
 I was very surprised, This CD was GREAT!! Wow, it had everyone at work ON THE FLOOR!! I like the "Belching Gourmet". Timing along with a wide spectrum of topics, make his one of the Funniest Comics out today! BRAVO!

 Not as easy to use as a larger Panasonic I used to own but otherwise fine. Good sound.  Using CD player and radio. Buying via Amazon as usual is super 
 This collection offers an invaluable contribution to the debates about gays and lesbians serving in the military. For anyone interested in thinking through the issues rigorously, this book is a "must read. 
 The cover on this one is a bit deceptive since the large robot stuff is just a short article. But the rest of the magazine rocks! Great projects from simple marshmallow shooters, to a PC modded into the case of an Atari 2600, to robotic dogs and mice. There is ten solid pages on podcasting, both receiving podcasts and creating your own. If you thought the first one was great you will love this one. 
 Though this book is an oldie, I enjoyed it nevertheless. The author covers all aspects of the sport as it was in his time and does it in a thorough and interesting way 
 I gravitated towards this book after realizing that my business idea did not fit easily within any of the prepackaged business plan software. The idea of writing the financial forcasting projections and tables on my own was quite daunting, but following this book I not only understood how to write the plan, but learned a great deal about small business financials in the process. I had use the software in the past and I had not learned a thing. Here, for the first time I actually understood why a good business plan is important, aside from being a tool for getting people to lend you money, as an actual tool to making the business work. I highly recommend this book to anybody that wants to learn a bit more about financial planning before setting out to accomplish their dream. Personally I am very grateful to have found this book, as it made a hard job easy to do. Thanks Mike, your book is a winner 
 Diane Tracy's book offers power-ideas for taking your business to the next level.  Many times, business books can be dry, but Diane makes hers a page-turner from start to finish 
 This book is an excellent reader for the young baseball fan.  Easy to  read, designed for young readers.  Follows the life of baseball's greatest  all-time catcher from his humble beginnings in Binger, Oklahoma to his  induction into Baseball's Hall of Fame in 1989.  Includes carrier stats and  additional bibliography of other books about Johnny Bench.  Also includes  numerous photos for the reader to enjoy 
 You may have forgotten just how funny this one is.  It's great for those times when you just want to smile, but aren't sure what to watch.  Plus, you have the added benefit that most young people haven't seen it yet!  Nothing too objectionable in it, so that's good too.  
 I have read you kitchen confidential, a cook's tour, and gone bamboo. Let me tell you, the first two were excellent. This one and gone bamboo were so simply written. You can tell he is definatly not an author per say, but he is so much fun you can't put it down. His writing needs some help. But who cares!! I love him. Please marry me. 
 We don't hear much these days about the Branch Davidians, Heaven's Gate or even Jim Jones. It's tempting to think that the cult movement has faded and that the world's attention is on more pressing matters -- like suicide bombers. But they are all of a piece, according to Chico State University Associate Professor of Sociology Janja Lalich.  In "Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships" ($19.50 in paperback from Bay Tree Publishing), Lalich and co-author Madeleine Tobias, a Vermont psychotherapist, make clear that modern day cults have not disappeared. "If there is less street recruiting today, it is because many cults now use professional associations, campus organizations, self-help seminars, and the Internet as recruitment tools" to entice the unwary.  Who gets sucked into a cult? "Although the public tends to think, wrongly, that only those who are stupid, weird, crazy and aimless get involved in cults, this is simply untrue. ... We know that many cult members went to the best schools in the country, have advanced academic or professional degrees and had successful careers and lives prior to their involvement in a cult or cultic abusive relationship. But at a vulnerable moment, and we all have plenty of those in our lives (a lost love, a lost job, rejection, a death in the family and so on), a person can fall under the influence of someone who appears to offer answers or a sense of direction."  For the authors, "a group or relationship earns the label 'cult' on the basis of its methods and behaviors -- not on the basis of its beliefs. Often those of us who criticize cults are accused of wanting to deny people their freedoms, religious or otherwise. But what we critique and oppose is precisely the repression and stripping away of individual freedoms that tends to occur in cults. It is not beliefs that we oppose, but the exploitative manipulation of people's faith, commitment, and trust."  Written for those coming out of cults, as well as for family members and professionals, "Take Back Your Life" deals with common characteristics of myriad cult types: Eastern, religious and New Age cults; political, racist and terrorist cults; psychotherapy, human potential, mass transformational cults; commercial, multi-marking cults; occult, satanic or black-magic cults; one-on-one family cults; and cults of personality. Chapters deal with the cult experience, the process of healing, stories of families and children in cults and therapeutic issues.  The book features riveting personal accounts from ex-cult members and offers a wide range of resources for the person who is trying to retrieve his or her "pre-cult" personality. Education looms large, for that can begin to break down the narrow black-and-white thinking cult members often display. Many cults redefine common terms or introduce special vocabulary making it difficult for members to make sense of the world outside of even their own inner aspirations.  The authors are also concerned about those in the education and helping professions who don't see the dangers posed by cults both to the individual and the larger community. Part of the purpose of the book is to make a credible case that any course of therapy needs to take into account a patient's cult associations.  "Take Back Your Life" is a book of hope, an excellent starting point for those thinking of exiting a cult and for those who are taking back their lives, one day at a time 
 Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason was the deciding factor in my decision to reject Christianity as a truthful world-view. I struggled for years, growing up in an evangelical church, with the idea of accepting the blood of a god-man as the ultimate resolution to humanity's shortcomings. I am so thankful for the enlightenment that Paine's work introduced to me. I couldn't personally affirm the Bible's accounts of prophecy and miracles were works of fiction until I read Age of Reason.  Paine writes in such a manner that is sometimes impetuous, but always guided by common sense. This is why Paine is so fun to read! While reading (more than twice) I would frequently slam the book down and exclaim "That's so true!". This work has survived the test of time. It continues to speak to fresh generations of free-thinkers. Age of Reason is an excellent introduction into other works of higher Biblical criticism, like those of Dr. Robert M. Price, who, if you haven't heard of him, is a brilliant scholar.   If you loved Age of Reason, try The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man, by Dr. Price. It's far more researched, and provides further insight into many of Paine's arguments.   My only hesitance to the Age of Reason is that I get the sense that Paine honestly believed that the church would crumble after he wrote his book. For example, he wrote "I have now gone through the Bible, as a man would go through a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees. Here they lie; and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may, perhaps, stick them in the ground, but they will never make them grow." and "Certain as I am that when opinions are free, either in matters of government or religion, truth will finally and powerfully prevail."  Although I vehemently agree with Paine in both cases, and I hope that TRUTH will finally prevail, it seems the world is growing more in superstition and not less. Paine's success in instigating a revolution of government certainly encouraged him in attempting a revolution of religion. No free-thinker can blame him for hoping, but for being so certain I may have to. Although the time-period in which the book was written may excuse his overconfidence.    Age of Reason is a great classic, and a work of genius. If you don't own this book you should. 
 `Beading on a Loom' by Don Pierce is sort of two books in one, and both suffers and gains from that fact. The book begins with something of an overview of basic seed beading techniques which, to someone like me, who did some pretty large self-designed American Indian style beading projects many years ago, is just right as a next step in teaching us how to, for example, do French woven chains, where the weave splits into two different runs of warp, to be joined at their ends with a clasp. This project also adds elements such as a medallion and fringes.  Looking through the `Tools and Techniques' chapter, one's initial reaction is that the book is a good elementary introduction to beading on a loom. However, while the instruction is very good, it really picks up at an intermediate level. I strongly believe that if I had no prior experience with seed beading, I would find myself doing a lot of fumbling around trying to make sense of some of the instructions. The three leading signs of the intermediate level of the book is that it does not bother explaining such elementary terms as warp and weft; it has too few photographs or illustrations of some of the most elementary techniques such as the look of a beading needle; and it cites no sources for beading supplies.  This is not to say that this is not a valuable book for a beginner. The second half of the book is a photographic gallery of beading pieces done by expert craftsmen. For someone brought up on American Indian beading techniques and designs, these pics are a revelation of what has been done by contemporary and historical artisans working in the European tradition of haute couture, elevating a simple craft to the level of high art.  The problem one faces with this book, just as I encountered when I read Colette Peters' `Cakes to Dream On' is that while I know all the basics of loom beading (and cake baking), the book really doesn't give me everything I need to make the leap from craft to art. Of course, it may simply not be possible to do this in one book, but the book clearly show one how high one can aspire in working in what seems to be a really simple technique. In that vein, the book scores points with me for giving a nice little bibliography on loom beading techniques. There is nothing more frustrating than wanting more from a book, without a clue as to where to go.  The fact is that the craft is a lot more complicated than what you will find in your Boy Scout merit badge pamphlet on Indian Lore! Also, one little thing which tips the scale for me between a four and five star rating is Mr. Pierce's very engaging writing style. In technical fields such as handicrafts and cooking for example, it is so nice to find someone who writes as entertainingly as he writes well about his subject. 
 Spellbinding is the word!  The story has so many twists and turns, you don't know where it's heading.  Big surprise in the end!  You will love it!  If I could, I would give it 6 stars instead of 5. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 Moliere and Wilbur, though they did not, of course, work together, are a match for Gilbert and Sullivan as a wedding of talents. Each of these plays is very funny and full of insights about human vanity 
 This book is a great one to get you acquainted with lease-options and subject-to's. Wendy takes you step by step through the process, and also gives you checklists to refer to as you put your deal together. She does however make some broad assumptions from time to time about when either type of contract is beneficial and why. For example, she mentions that owners with good credit are more likely to entertain a lease-option than a subject-to. This is not always the case. Sometimes owners with bad credit are looking for a "leg up", but don't want to surrender title. In that case, they actually might prefer a lease-option. Also in my experience, many owners with good credit prefer a subject-to because they want their name off the title, but don't want to deal with the tax hit of selling the property outright, right now. If they enter a subject-to, they can have their mortgage payments made by the investor, and give them time to have the property reclassified from "primary residence" to "investment property". They can then do 1031 exchanges tax free once the investor is ready to close (usually more than 1-2 years down the line.  Overall though, this book is a must if you want to learn about the ins and outs of lease-options and subject-tos. 
 this is an amazing, beautifully written first novel. not only is the plot first rate, the characters are drawn with a rare degree of perception and even compassion. the relationships are realistic and change as the investigation proceeds and when the murderer is caught. the dialogue is natural, and reflects the personality of the character speaking.  there is also wonderful humor in the descriptions and the dialogue.  this is the mystery to lend the friends who think mysteries are shallow, formulaic and generally not worth wasting time on. this is the book to lend to friends who love good writing.   i can't wait for the next 
 A lot of what is "not" said is what is profound in this film.  No one speaks of it out in the open, but in Japan, still today, there are these people in these places called "Bu-Ra-Ku" who live outside of the rest of the world. They were cast off there because their ancestors back in the Feudal era did something to disrespect the royalty/lord or committed inhumane crimes. These crimes were considered so bad that their families and distant offsprings were also cursed for eternity.    The main character and her sweetheart (husband) lived in one of those places in the city of Osaka.  She was oblivious and just happy there. That life was all she new. She had her best friend, her family, and now the new baby. He was not so happy on the other hand.  You see, in Japan they still have "The Black Book" and Corporations/Schools still use them.  Chriminals and inhabitants of "Bu-Ra-Ku" are on this list.  So although he was smart and capable, he could only get a low-paying, suited-for-Bu-Ra-Ku jobs.  I think maybe that's why he was so drawn to "Maboroshi" lights out on the ocean and went chasing for it. And maybe, the main character's grandmother who probably married into this poverty left to go die in her home land in Shikoku Island because she just wanted to escape from there and go home in her last days.    People (actors) and the personified beauty/nature in this story act out their parts so perfectly, especially the main character. Her sadness is overwhelming but at the same time her hopefulness and innocence shines through like a bright beacon.  I could not stop crying and sobbing all the way through this film when I first watched it.  And now it has become my own bitter-sweet memory 
 After reading Cara Black's Murder in the Marais, I eagerly awaited the publication of this novel.  It did not disappoint.  As in her first adventure, the protagonist Aimee Leduc takes the reader on a roller coaster ride through a Paris rich in atmospheric detail.  This is a nail-biting tale written by a natural story teller whose research is impeccable.  I'm looking forward to the next in the series, Murder in the Sentier 
 This book is one of the saddest that I have ever read! Patricia MacLachlan describes the way a family mourns a wrenching loss,  deals with a struggle with a suprising new temporary addition to the family, and preserves memories of years past. This book has an incredible page-turning ability and it keeps you crying. It has a VERY well-written plot. I highly recommend this book!!!! 
 Music sets the mood and tone of a motion picture.  It gives feelings in scenes that have no visual feeling.  For "Crash" to work as a movie, it needed a soundtrack and score that would allow the audience to relate.  Mark Isham accomplishes this beautifully.  The music puts you in a state that allows you to see all the craziness that's being shown, believe it, and accept it, without getting as upset as you should.  This music seems to numb you to the horrible experiences the characters of the movie go through, while at the same time giving emotion that makes the viewer uncomfortable at times.  I truly believe this soundtrack was the leading reason for the movie being as successful as it was.  The music allowed the audience to take in the intense subject matter of the film without getting too upset.  The subject matter of the movie is upsetting, but the music sedates you.  It allows you to relate to it.  The music brings the movie's atmosphere to your car, your house, your office, or where ever you listen to your music.  It's a wonderful score to study to, or if you're in need of an emotional moment 
 Lewis Carrol,when entertaining the liddel children one summer came up with a rather novel little story in which Alice Liddel would find herself in"wonderland",a place not entirely unlike Victorian England,but odd and charming(which 19th century England was not)...later Carrol(who was in fact the ,an Oxford Don,noted photographer,and local celebrity),would fill out the story told to little Alice Liddel and the charming"alice through the looking glass"was born..Apparently the book itself is no longer read,inasmuchas most of the reviews of this,the only really faithful adaptation of the work,compare it badly to the cartoon version by Disney...Carrol's humour was always grounded in 19th century current events,and many of the curious little poems included in the work were not so much"nonsense"as they were clever adaptations of events and personalities of the time period...The fact that young children,like Alice Liddel(then about ten years old) could recognise the grown-up aspects of the Carrol story while at the same time being entertained says much for the level of education given children then(and says much about the ABSENCE of such education now)..If one wants an entertaining,but largely gutted version of "Alice in wonderland" one should skip this film and opt for the Disney product...it is slick and uncompicated,and requires no thinking whatsover,a perfect film for the MTV generation...If ,on the other hand,YOU HAVE ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK,and want a film that reflects what Carrol actually wrote,then skip Disney & buy THIS version...you won't be disappointed.. 
 Ok, we all have to shampoo and we've all tried hundreds of products.  This one by Aveda is heavenly. The scent is almost as sweet and fresh as a brand new baby - you know, ladies.  It's bliss.  You just close your eyes and inhale the loveliness of it. Plus, it cleans hair well, leaving it soft and fresh, full.  The shampoo is bliss. Find it, buy it, use it. At least try it once. An upforgettable experience in the shower 
 One of the most profound movies I have ever seen. Fantastic acting from both the stars and the supporting actors. A must see, especially for Jack Nicholson fans. 
 This book tells the story of sister bear when she meets a young cub that recently arrived to town.  This new cub is a little annoying, and at first it makes sister sad.   But she finally realizes that with self confidence, she can be herself, and have good times with her real friends. My 4 year old loves it 
 This film was actually made during World War Two, and for this reason it has a special fascination.  Thank God that Japan and the United States are now fast friends, but this picture reminds us in stark terms that it was not always thus.  This film refers to the Japanese in a derogatory fashion and uses terms that Americans pretty much never use now and rightly not.  But during and for a time after the war these terms were in common usage in reference to an enemy who was both reviled for his savagery and respected for his competence.  This film absolutely reflects these attitudes.  Even so, at one point in the film after an American sailor is stabbed literally in the back by a Japanese pilot he was trying to save, a crewman observes that the sailor died so that the next generation of American kids, and Japanese kids too, would have more roller skates and toys instead of weapons.  Cary Grant, as the submarine skipper, turns in his usual fine performance as basically the perfect Captain.  The rest of the cast is Hollywood's idea of a typical American submarine crew.  In fact, the film is somewhat of a recruiting film, and plainly was aimed at bucking up the spirits and morale of the home front.  But for all that, this film features a very decent storyline, and entertains the viewer.  I prefer this one to "Run Silent, Run Deep" but my all time favorite remains "The Enemy Below."    A very good viewing experience.  Recommended 
 Well worth reading; entertaining and enlightening, up to a point. Some minor complaints: too much walking around to no purpose, too much boring talk about the dog, too much melodrama and tears, etc. But these are mostly minor distractions from a serious and important book. Much like Tolstoy's Confession. One "reason for living" she doesn't consider: religion. Starts slow. Worth reading twice 
 NOTE:  THIS IS VOLUME ONE ONLY!  It's a great book but it is not labeled as just the first half of the memoir 
 I was given a copy of this CD by a friend who knows of my love for jazz. It was my first time ever hearing Dave Brubecks Quartet. I put it on and was busy doing things while half listening until Perdido came on and everything stopped. I knew at that moment I was hearing an incredible talent. Like the first time I ever heard Kind of Blue, I was mesmerized. I immediatley had to hear more, I wanted everything this group ever made.  This has become one of my all time favorite discs. The interplay between the rhythym section and the beautiful tone of Paul Desmond gives you chills. I personally believe that this is the best CD ever by DBQ,even more than Take Five. Listen and see if you don`t agree that this is one of the Classic jazz discs ever 
 This book will tranform you..  you will accept your body, and start a  strong relationship with your own sexuality,You don't have to agree with everything FireFox says, just allow yourself to start a modern and positive empowerment attitude through the process of transformation of your own psyche.Get aroused and use that energy to conquer the world :)  You Can do it. 
 What I love about the book is its very practical approach to maximize the use of your camera to enjoy photography.  There is a balance between teaching photography through words and pictures.    And if you have kids and love your kids dearly, it is obvious that Jim's favorite subject is his family. For me, that;s called passion.  
 Excellent reading and very typical of Mr. Ishiguro writing: slow, painfully analytical of seemingly mundane events and conversations yet intriguing because we constantly expect (and receive) a reward from all these detailed dissections. On the other hand, the book doesn't emphasize at all on the technical details of what really goes on behind the scenes when a "donation" is given ("what body part did they take away now from this poor child now?") or what the actual scientific purpose is. At first, I got irritated with this but later realized it wasn't the point to have all this explained in detail. After all, the book would become meaningless if the characters would realize their freedom and decide to say "up yours" and flee the whole scene.. I found a strong feeling of gloom and sadness as I lived through the emotions of the characters and constantly hoped for their escape, which of course never came. This sadness surprisingly stayed with me for quite a while. A fast-forward slice of life of individuals that had a tremendous amount of impact on both the other characters in the book as well as the reader.. Not a book for everyone, but that's Ishiguro for you.  
  We spend a lot of time, a lot of our lives working. As such it makes sense to progress at work, get as much out of your job as you can, and above all else to enjoy working so that you are not spending so much time in an unplesant atmosphere.   At first glance this book appears oriented to the female employee. As you read it, it is just as applicable to the male worker. The techniques, hints and tips are not gender specific. Most of them are oriented around work, but there is a chapter on the work/life balance. You don't want to grow older wondering where your life went. As the old saying goes, no one would want their tombstone to to read -- I should have spent more time at work.   The book is filled with short and direct tips that say do this one thing. Later you can move to the next step having accomplished the first step 
 As an Arkansas native and as one who has spent decades living and working in the Ozarks I felt qualified to add a few comments. The area he describes as "Stay More" is an area I have covered on foot doing research and recreation. Some of my best friends are from that region, Murray, Swain, Edwards Junction, and Deer, so it really "hits home".  When Harrington writes about ,"Stay More" he is inspired but when he strays from this less than idylic community the inspiration thins. Regardless, I would reccommend this book to anyone and am proud that an Arkansas author has picked up the torch that was once carried by Vance Randolph. Oustanding 
 I thought this was a great book. Good to read when you have to stop and go.  you also learned about historic moments, science and ecology.  I garantee it will make you smile when you dont feel well. I would suggest  you read it now 
 I have read a few reviews on here by people I feel did not actually purchase this book and were pre-judging it based on part of the pagan communities views towards SRW.  I will agree that many of her books seem to be on the "fluffy" side, especially anything with "Teen" in the title.  Here first series of books were very useful to those just starting out in Wicca or Witchcraft.  She then submitted some books on the market, which I would not offer up to someone starting in the Craft.  However, this book I believe brought her redemption.  If you are not willing to do some studying then this book is not for you.  (That is why I feel she got some bad reviews on it.)  She covers many aspects of Wicca, Witchcraft, Spirituality, and Magic(k).  If you read the book from start to finish then I think you will have a good base to begin your practices and seek out new information.  When you read it, it does seem directed towards teens yet she throws some adult things in as well.  In the back there are spells she offers up for suggestions, however throughout the entire book she insists spells written you write for yourself are more effective.  She also gives the complete guidelines for spells, ritual, and the purposes behind each part, such as why and how to cast a circle, call the quarters, recite the Charge of the Goddess.  There are two things in the book I do not enjoy.  The first is that everything is from a very feminine point of view.  I am not saying it is Dianic but she briefly mentions the God.  The second, is that she is clearly influenced by Dutch Folk Magic(k) and I am more interested in other things.  For both of these things I could go buy separate books.  I think this book is a great starting place for someone interested in Wicca, as long as you pay head and know that her advice does not mean it is Wiccan Law. 
 As a student of Dr. Babin's iaido instructor, Harry Dach sensei, this book is close to home for me. It covers the techniques of the kamimoto-ha of muso shinden ryu iaido just as I'm learning them, in great detail concerning not only the mechanics of the technics, but the mindset behind them, and their martial roots. The photographs are clear, and the flow clean and concise.  This book serves as a prime companion to proper dojo training. 
 This is my favorite DVD.  I had seen this movie when it first came out and I remembered how I felt watching it.  Loved Olivia Newton John & her duets & dancing.  The cartoons are cute too 
 Philosophical Explanations has become my handbook when I need to understand a new philosophical concept, or review an already familiar one. I went through more than several philosophy books pursuing my curiosity of  philosophy. Most of them were either far far more lengthy than I had the  patience for, or just intractable. Philosophical Explanations is perfectly  named, is just that, and does it well 
 The best episode is on this season. You should definetly own this one 
 "Patriots" gets off to a fascinating lively start capturing the events leading to the Revolution thanks to Langguth's engaging writing.  Langguth captures the excitement and tension of the era quite well through many stories, some well known, and others largely unknown or unfamiliar.  Langguth is at his best relaying unfolding events in Boston and his narrative crackles with energy and life to the point where you feel like you are bearing witness.  "Patriots" should be required reading for anyone interested in the events leading to the Revolution as it is the most coherent and cogent on the topic I've ever read.  Langguth keeps things interesting through the early campaigns of the war but as the Revolution drags on the chapters become shorter and less interesting, primarily relaying stories retold elsewhere.  By the time of the Southern Campaign Langguth seems to be running on fumes and the war ends with a whimper rather than a bang.  By comparison Carl Weeks has a much livelier retelling of the Siege of Savannah in "Savannah in the Time of Peter Tondee" than you'll find here.  This isn't to say "Patriots" isn't good, its just not consistently good throughout, which is surprising considering Langguth's credentials and background.  His failure to hold the readers interest in the latter years of the war is shocking and disappointing as the book gets off to such a rousing start.  Langguth would have been better served trying to find some way to break the book into two component parts, the events leading to and during the Revolution.  In spite of this flaw I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in reading more about the events leading up to the Revolution.  It enlightened me in ways immeasurable 
 This book may be small but it packs a huge punch.  Beautifully written it will bring tears to your eyes 
 What better experience for an avid reader than a mystery set among rare books and book collectors? In this, the first and by far the best of his published novels, case-hardened detective Cliff Janeway turns out to be not only a book lover, but a budding book merchant. Never mind how improbable the combination, Janeway is charismatic as all getout and the story grabbed me almost from the first lines.  With a cache of mint condition Milagro Beanfield War first editions tucked away, and a yen for a change in occupation, our detective hero has a special interest in the latest homicide. He runs an occasionally open rare bookstore on the side, and the victim is one of his book scouts.  Right up front we get some wonderful detail on the somewhat shady business of book scouting, and it doesn't hurt at all that when the plot `thickens' it involves dealers and others who play roles in the business, because that means there's lots more good stuff to come. In addition to a first class mystery, Booked to Die is chock full of information on books and book collectors. This novel, like the rarest of first editions, is the kind of find that in the end makes you smile and know it's all been worth the trouble. If you're ready to buy, there's a signed first on offer over at ABE for $2,450. Or you could pick up a PB for just a few bucks right here on the Zon. Either way, you're in for a great read.

 Dr. Samenow has a "spirit of the law" approach as he sketches in traits of anit-social people.  He clarifies and substantiates the idea that people, including young children are responsible for their choices  regardless of life circumstances.  The book validates parents, frees them  from the numbness of guilt, gives them confidence and encourages them with  ideas of how to to respond to their antisocial children.  As an elementary  school counselor I feel this book should be read or the message in it  should be conveyed to teachers of these children, as well as their parents.   This book does not "spoon feed" the reader.  If one wants  specific ideas, s/he should refer to current parenting books that address  this important issue.  Now more than ever, we need to guide children into  patterns of respect and responsibility, thus preventing antisocial  personality development 
 "The Guns of August" documents the events, conversations, strategies, and expectations that unfolded across Europe from July to September 1914.  To brutally paraphrase the 500 pages of Barbara Tuchman's genius....in regards to the outbreak of World War I, virtually everything that was expected didn't happen, and everything that could have gone wrong did.  Contrary to the "domino effect" jargon we're taught in high school (the war was a spontaneous reaction to Archduke Ferdinand's assassination), Tuchman illustrates quite convincingly (as German primary sources have supported...read Kaiser Wilhelm II and General Moltke's speeches and memoirs), this war had years in the planning.   In the movie "Thirteen Days", President Kennedy uses the book as a means to deride his hawkish generals and what he considers their poor sense of long-sighted policymaking.  He uses the mistakes made by the generals in "The Guns of August" as examples.  But the book is not about the idiocy of generals, or even politicians.  The book does not lay blame or point fingers.  And when the book does pass judgment (stubborn Joffre's Plan 17 should have been aborted much sooner), it reciprocates in later pages (Joffre's stubbornness helps turn the German right flank).    The one question underlying the entire book is "What if?"  What if the Belgians at Liege hadn't fought?  What if von Kluck hadn't swung his First and Second Armies inland?  What if Britian had refused to add its troops to the French Sixth Army?  What if the German captain hadn't been killed and the German HQ battle plans not been intercepted?  Every page offers these "What ifs", and it keeps the reader on his/her toes.  This book also shuts up the armchair generals who glance over a war, like a road crew worker on Monday morning discussing a football game, and says, "What idiots...why didn't they do this?  Why didn't they do that?  How could they not see what was coming?"  "The Guns of August" answers these questions, and when the situations are examined up close and personal, it's clear that the men running Europe made about as reasonable, logical, and cautious decisions as can be made in wartime.  We have the luxury of not only hindsight, but of viewing the war as a whole.  In the middle of the war, a field officer knows only the battle around him and what information he receives from other officers.  Spread a rumor around your work or school, and in a single week see how distorted the rumor has become from the original one you spread.  Now pass a vital piece of information up and down lines of divisions and corps and armies during a full-fledged world war and see how great your communication is.    You don't need to be a military historian to follow this book.  There are maps to help the confused reader.  If there are wartime lessons to learn from the book, they are these:  remain strategically flexible, know your enemy, and plan for contingencies 
             "It is 1962 and the Second World War has been over for seventeen years: people have now had a chance to adjust to the new order. But it's not been easy. The Mediterranean has been drained to make farmland, the population of Africa has virtually been wiped out and America has been divided between the Nazis and the Japanese. In the neutral buffer zone that divides the two superpowers lives the man in the high castle, the author of an underground bestseller, a work of fiction that offers an alternative theory of world history in which the Axis powers didn't win the war."              The Man in the High Castle won the Hugo award in 1963. This alternative history story is an amazing vision of what if. But its much more than that. It's a story of a book with in a book. One of the cornerstones of the story is a book titled The Grasshopper Lies Heavy by Hawthorne Abendsen, who is the Man in the High Castle. Grasshopper is itself an alternate history book in which Germany and Japan did not win WW2.              Dick is a master of the esoteric in this book. He weaves a tale worthy of the title "Masterwork". For a work over 40 years old it does not feel dated. Characterizations are well developed for a book if this modest length. I found myself re-evaluating my opinions of the protagonists, most especially Juliana, several times as I read. This is a must read for any fan of speculative fiction.              9 out of 1 
 When I first picked up the book, I expected to find the usual correlations between the Matrix and Christianity. You know...Neo being Jesus, Morpheus the Holy Spirit, etc. However, this is not what this book contains. The Matrix and Philosophy is a collection of essays and other writings that compare ideas presented in The Matrix with philosophical writings from throughout history. The entire book is centered around one question; is the world presented in The Matrix a possibility? Throughout the book the "Matrix Possibility" is put up against writings of Descartes, Robert Nozick, and many other philosophical writers. I was very impressed with book overall and would recommend this book to almost any fan of the Matrix that has asked themselves "Is it really possible?&quot 
 McFadden spends much of this book discussing the basics of evolutionary theory and quantum mechanics, which I suppose he is obligated to do if the book is targeted at people uninitiated in the basic tenets and developments in both those disciplines. However, to truly appreciate what the book is conveying, the reader needs to be quite well-versed in neoDarwinism and QM in order to really analyze the "new" messages in this book, and understand the implications. It is fairly involved reading, and I found it very interesting. However, to truly do justice to the important message the author is writing about, he needs to do a more rigorous job of explaining all the concepts that go into what is really a large edifice of assumptions that appears fragile to the touch. Of course, that would be too sophisticated for a general non-fiction book, and would be more appropriate in a journal publication. That being said, this book is no more fanciful and contrived than books on string theory, such as Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe", but is every bit as engaging in providing a new perspective on life, the universe, and everything!  In response to another customer's comments on this website, who states that McFadden makes an incorrect application of the uncertainty principle - I request him to clarify that point. While I feel that McFadden's arguments appear incomplete, they do not appear inaccurate. Certainly, nothing in his "primer" on QM is incorrect to my knowledge, and I am fairly well-versed in those issues. Furthermore, the reviewer also comments that McFadden was intellectually honest about the problems with evolutionary theory, but that is an inaccurate description. There are no "issues" with neoDarwinism that McFadden explores. NeoDarwinism only describes the evolution of species, it does not address the issue of the origin of the first self-replicator. NeoDarwinism simply assumes the existence of self-replicating molecules, if that - in actuality, it deals with evolution from the first single-cell life form, and leaves the job of explaining the origin of the first "lifeform" to physicists/chemists/geologists/whomever. One of the theories was the "chemical soup" theory, and this is NOT connected with neoDarwinism except by popular acceptance of a connection. It is here that McFadden honestly admits that there are unanswered questions 
 I had read "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems" By the mathermatician himself and then found Ernest Nagel's "Godel's Proof" nearly by accident.  The titles of the work are examples of the main diffeernce of the two: the latter is far more simple and comprehensible.  Diving right into Goedels work with a some decent understanding of mathematics and a thourough reading of "Principia Mathematica" by Russel and Whitehead, I thought I would be able to handle it.  I was able to comprehend Goedel but found it gave me a headache to read more than a few pages at a time. Getting through after far too many hours and little true understanding.  It seemed that while I could grasp the concepts I wasnt so clear on the subtlties of Goedel's theorem. I was more than happy to read Nagel's Work which is very approachable and exemplifies the important points that the average person might breeze through in Goedel's work.  This being said the work of Nagel should be considered an introduction to Goedel's work and both have their place as excellent works.   I would recommend that everyone who is interested in the philosophical and mathematical implications of the incompleteness theorem read this work and keep it on hand as they attempt Goedel.  I find that people seem to get the basic idea of incompleteness but overextend or misunderstand its reach in life and in meaning. The theorem itself is among the most interesting mathematics and it is a philosophically profound idea that people at large dont grasp since the system of mathematics appears to work well in nearly all situations.  This book will be enjoyable and easy to understand even if you dont have a degree in mathematics so long as you tkae it slow but understnading of the Principia and mathematical philosophy is key to getting the most out of this.

 Edgar Rice Burroughs, well-known as the creator of "Tarzan," was also a pioneer in the realm of science fiction. "A Princess of Mars" was originally written in serial form in 1912. The story is painted in broad strokes, with generous helpings of adventure, combat, and romance. The writing and dialogue sound quaint and stilted to modern ears, and the plot tends to meander. Borroughs' science may strike us today as a bit silly, but for 1912 it's very creative and imaginative. The detailed portrait of Martian society is fascinating.  "A Princess of Mars" is a classic, and science fiction fans will enjoy it both for its curiosity quotient and its entertainment value 
 Last night I planned to read this book for just a few minutes before going to sleep.  Hours later, instead of sleeping I was transformed into the world of the Balkan Roma musicians and their incredible culture!  I simply couldn't put this amazing book down.  I love the stories and interviews with the old musicians, the informative history of the Roma people and their culture, the full-of-life photos, and the CD with soundscapes.  All these pieces combine to give the reader a great view of a people and their heritage, and one that has been largely overlooked in the past.  I found the work ethic of the musicians described in this book to be very inspirational.  To be able to play all kinds of requests for days on end is really something to admire.  Musicians of any genre could learn a whole lot from reading about the musicians in this book.  Years ago, these authors turned me on to the subculture of polka in the USA (and made a polkaholic out of me) with their super "Polka Happiness" book.  They have clearly done it again - informed the world about an incredibly rich culture that was largely hidden from view 
 The exercise on disc 2 worked like a miracle for me. It seems silly. I think that is why it works so well. The brain likes it. Brain candy that is good for you!!!!!! 
 After moving into a new house, the newly-wed Gwenda suddenly remembered the murder of a woman named Helen in that house which she witnessed when she was 3. Gwenda and her husband Giles trailed every single clue available to them and it was later found out that Helen was actually Gwenda's stepmother. But the strange thing is although Gwenda's father had strongly believed he had strangled Helen to death and he later killed himself because of it, Helen's body was never found. Firmly believing her vision that Helen was murdered by a man with "monkey paws" hands, Gwenda and her husband were determined to uncover the long buried truths. Miss Marple kindly advised them to let the sleeping murder lie but to no avail and she had no means but to get herself involved as well. But could they really find out what actually happened on that night 18 years ago?  I'm surprised that I was able to figure out the ending fairly quickly but that doesn't take much away from the fact that it's intense, creepy and overall a very enjoyable read. A jewel in the Miss Marple series, no less. 
 This is one of my favorite films. The quality of the print shows it's age. It would really benefit from a clean up 
 If you liked French Quarter, Sin City is just for you!  Lacey Alexander keeps the heat turned up on this one 
 LOVED THE BOOK - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  ONLY AROUND 300 PAGES - BUT ALL USEFUL INFORMATION, WITH AN EXCELLENT DEFINITIONS SECTION ENTITLED "LINGO&quot 
 I have read many books on dog training, and never before has anyone offered a plan so detailed or as simple to follow as Kenneth Roebuck.  His insight into how a dog thinks and how we can use that to our advantage in  training is at once ordinary and astounding.  Skip all the popular training  methods of the moment and use this one.  You will never raise a better gun  dog 
 This is a great prayer tool for Christians in their daily devotions.  It encourages people to prayer each day for a different influential person.  A picture of the person and a concise article telling how the person  influences the world is included for each day of the year.  The authors  encourage non-judgemental praying for all individual even those with whom  people may disagree or find offensive 
 Johnson's Dictionary is great for browsing for fun and excellent reference book! PDF format requires fast computer and considerable memory to run swiftly 
 Wells certainly does a mounumental job here of taking on Christ in our Postmodern World.  For to do so, one must take on what is postmodernism and what are it's various outcroppings in the culture and church.  What started out as a very exciting work for this reviewer through the four chapters of eight, slowed down significantly after diagnosing the cultural scene.  Here Wells is at his best as he brings together many concepts and "-isms" coordianting them under the main heading of "spiritual vs. religion."  These terms definitions have changed from what I have been thinking they were, and he presents convincing evidence here.  This for many will be the most useful portion of the book for many readers.  When he shifts in chapter five to Christ in the meaninglessness and the church's aberrations of it, it seemed to drag signficantly for me.  Maybe it was that this was simply a rehash of what I already knew and was aware of or possibly his extended engagement with open theism, etc. which caused the losing of "one star", but this certainly was letdown of expectations.  He did redeem himself slightly in closing admonition about authenticity of church and marketing of seeker services.  One can be rewarded by this read, least of which is Wells' perceptive insights into vast literature on these subjects and footnotes and bibliography for followup.  The church certainly is being lied to when it is exhorted to change or die, be it from the Spong's of this world or the Rick Warren/Bill Hybels.  As this fascinating read suggests: they are kissing cousins.  What is left out is any examination of the seductive tendencies to falsely separate doctrine from practice, or substance from style.  See Klem Preus' great book on this, so inaptly titled: Fire and Staff.  Highly recommended 
 Some years ago while digging in the National Archives I met the author. At  that time she was pursuing the research for this book. When she mentioned  that she was the "Undercover Girl" I immediately thought,  "AHA, Cynthia!" Well, she wasn't. You will have to read this book  to find out who Cynthia was and a whole host of others whose exploits were  not so "undercover" ; )!  At the time we met Ms. McIntosh's  original book "Undercover Girl" was scheduled to be reprinted in  the TIME-LIFE WW II espionage operations series, but that was not to be. I  finally got a copy of the original and found it to be a fascinating read.  This one is obviously not so immediate as her original but still gives the  flavor of the wartime experience. The fact that male chauvinism ruled in  those days is evident in that they were not paid the same rates and were  seldom promoted to their potential-- considering that most of the OSS women  where well-educated bilingual (or more) cosmopolitan citizens of many  nations of  the world, as adept with European royalty as with the natives  in the fetid jungles of Asia. Their story is well worth  telling and is  very interesting reading 
 Written for ease of comprehension but over-flowing with valuable mystical truths. If you are seriously spiritually questing, this is your answer. A must have for seekers  
 I would like to say what a joy and a healing it has been for me reading "Whatever Happened to Daddy's Little Girl" (The Impact of Fatherlessness on Black Women) by Jonetta Rose Barras. I have read it but constantly go back to it since I finished it. This book has literally captured my insecurities, made me admit to them, look deep into myself about where they came from,  and encouraged me to know that  can come from it all and be a complete woman.  I would encourage anyone to read it, even if you grew up with your father, because we need to know how to edify our sisters and provide that understanding for that siter that may not have had it as well as you have.  I'm already thinking about starting a group in my church for women my age, who may be going through these situations and suffering silently because they feel no one understands.  Anyway, I could go on and on, but I think i have said enough.  GOD BLES 
 My daughter & I absolutely loved this movie, so I bought the soundtrack for her as a gift.  We both love it!  I have always enjoyed movie soundtracks, since you get a nice mix of artists...but this one has the perfect balance of old and new music.  The 2 new songs performed by Chantal Kreviazuk are a terrific fit with old classics by Carly Simon and Al Green.  It's definitely a CD to listen to all the way through...no skipping on this one 
 Heard this book reviewed on NPR and couldn't resist.  My (grown) kids loved it.  Recommend leaving it on the kitchen table to be read bits at a time.  
 This movie is obviously not for everyone. It's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour's. Nope, instead you get the muscle a-cranking. Huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in. This film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart, soul, and body of every other thing in existence in an ever-changing world. This film is a big orgy of questioning. And who doesn't like questioning? This film, in its own right, is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films.  "Huckabees" offers us an impressive cast with Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Mark Wahlberg, Isabelle Huppert (one of my favorite international actress's) and Naomi Watts. Most notable performances by, namely, Dustin Hoffman as it's nice to see him in an exceptional role. He hasn't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997's "Wag the Dog." It's very nice to see Hoffman play a great character, as Bernard, the quirky husband half of the existential detectives. Also, most notable is the performance of Mark Wahlberg, as Tommy Corn, another client of the detectives that befriends Albert. Tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather, rides a bike to the fire saying, "We'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum." Mark Wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably "Boogie Nights" and "Three Kings." However, this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else. The ensemble's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless.   The most credit to this movie goes to writer/director David O. Russell. Russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story. But the story is amazingly written. The script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that. 
 Personally I find Sevendust's self titled album and their sophmore release Home better than this album, however that doesn't stop Animosity from kicking some ass. The opening song "T.O.A.B." is a great song with some heavy crunching guitar riffs and pounding drum work. The second song "Praise" is another good heavy song with a catchy chorus. My personal favorite song on here is "Shine". The chorus and the riffs are just catchy, and I just love the beat. Unlike most Nu-Metal singers, Lajon Witherspoon has one of the best singing voices in rock today, and this whole album proves how good he really is. So anyways, if you're looking for some good hard rock, you can't go wrong with Sevendust's Animosity. Get this album now along with the rest of their albums as well! Sevendust rocks! themetalbeast's ratings: 1. T.O.A.B.: 5/5 2. Praise: 5/5 3. Trust: 5/5 4. Crucified: 5/5 5. Xmas Day: 4/5 6. Dead Set: 4/5 7. Shine: 5/5 8. Follow: 4/5 9. Damaged: 5/5 10.

 First I want to thank the reviewer Matthew Antonich for an amazing and accurate description of this beautiful piece of work.  I must admit when I first listened to this cd I was very disappointed.  I am a huge fan of BT.  Everything he has ever done is here at my fingertips.  Anytime I get discouraged at the direction electronic music is going (sometimes) I put in a BT cd and all is right with the world.  My faith in electronic music is restored.  I had not listened to this cd more than once and didn't even bother with the dvd.  I even cancelled my plans to go see him perform the album live, not even having heard it in it's entirety.  Yesterday I plucked it from my car and popped it in only to be amazed by it.  I have had it on replay in my home since then.  You have to sit down and let this bring you inside the mind of BT. I am a trained musician and can fully appreciate the magnitude and brilliance of this.  My first thought after one viewing is this...It will take some time to make the rounds and word of mouth...but this is a piece of history.  It is almost too advanced for most people to even "get it." Anyone who likes BT or really loves and respects music in any form or genre will love this cd.  By the way, I'm not saying people are too stupid to understand this music.  I'm saying people do not allow themselves to let go. It is also very mature. That being said, when watching this, you get sucked in. It's like he holds your hand all the way. You just can't stop watching it.  It is historical and beautiful. As parent of 4, I can say that he melted my heart by the end of this and I was in tears.  BT I love you and I wish I had even a small amount of your talent!  This is the start of something and BT has CREATED it....mark my words 
 Michel'le didn't blow up because she was ahead of her times and Dr. Dre was no longer at Death Row to help her with the beats. Songs like "No More Lies", "Nicety" and  "Something In My Heart" confirms that she had what it took to be a top diva 
 This collection is a perfect example of the ability of a gifted poet to communicate difficult truths simply. Each piece is a work of art and sings in the voices of immigrants and immigrants' children and with the rhythms of life in the Middle East. This is a fantastic book in its own right and a great introduction to the talent and skill of Naomi Shihab Nye 
 This is the book a weather nut like me wished he had thought to write first. Great maps and photos, tables of data, and he asks for corrections, publishing them, with updates, at www.extremeweatherguide.com . The photos, such as Lincoln, NE, summer 1936, are spectacular, as are his colored maps of everything (wettest and driest spots by state is one example).  He even has NYC data from the mid 19th Century, with "the day that never got above zero" Now that takes some hunting to dig up.  A great gift, as well as a wonderful resource. All libraries, as well as anyone interested in the weather should have a copy 
 "Beautiful Girls". What a fantastic opportunity for lovers of Broadway musicals to see the behind the scenes creation and making of a successful musical in four days. This film is in part documentary combined with hi-lights of the finished performance at Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic. The story line of "Beautiful Women" attending a Follies Reunion so many years into retirement is powerful and awakens thoughts of aging. Mandy Patinkin, Carol Burnett, Barbara Cook and Lee Remick lead an all star cast in this Steven Sondheim Classic. You might want to view this film more than once. 
 Christopher Robin and his lovable Winnie-the-Pooh are quite inseparable. However, in the Hundred Acre Wood, the two rarely cross paths as Pooh spends much of his time tormenting the bees in various trees as he attempts to sneak off with some of their honey; searching for Eeyore's illustrious tail, which manages to disappear quite often; prances among the wood with wee Piglet searching for Woozle's and Heffalump's; bothers wise Owl as he attempts to receive answers to his many burning questions; tricking lovable Kanga as he rushes off with the young Roo; and aggravating Rabbit by getting stuck in his front door. However, no matter what the wonderful Pooh does, Christopher Robin still feels love for his crazy, silly old bear.  I have loved WINNIE-THE-POOH since I first began reading, and was overjoyed to find this brand new, 80th Anniversary Edition of the classic children's tales that won my heart years ago. The illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard filling each and every page are exquisite, as are the thick, butter-colored pages that the wonderful words are printed on. The fabulous thing about this collection is that each chapter is a tale of its own, so they are perfect for bedtime. My only qualm is that there is no sign of Tigger within these pages; however, hopefully he'll come along in the next installment. A delightful, must-own collection for any POOH fan - just in time for the holidays!  Erika Sorocc 
 Stephen Bachelor is an excellent translator and interpreter of Nargarjuna's wisdom.  His prose is clear and accessible and his translation of Nargarjuna's poetry inspired. This book is a must have for students of Mahayana Buddhism 
 Doctor who materialised without his Tardis on this, my first timelord download in the amazon unbox, which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside.  For a very reasonable sum, $1.99, my family and I were able to enjoy the first Third doctor adventure after his regeneration, where he encounters the Nestene Conciousness.  The down load took only a few minutes although I had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program. thanks to the good people at amazon tech support I was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental.  a great experience and will not be the last. easy to navigate and fun for all the family. someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis' 
 It was great to read about this sleepy little town so full of history. I have heard all the stories growing up and this book was a wonderful glimpse into a red hot time. My family has also read this book and recalled a few stores and places that are no longer here in Hudson now. My aunt remembers watching the raid while she was baby sitting across the street. It is a real shame that Hall had another volume of work to follow this book and it was lost. Hudson was know far and wide for it's colorful night life. The Albany members even heard of the stories growing up.  Reviewed by Dawnny Hudson Mahogany Media Revie 
 One of the best Hip Hop undeground album  !!! The golden years of Hip Hop are more or less the same : 93/94/95/96 (few till 1999 are still good,but... 
 I welcome this book for various reasons!  First of all because it is based on experience and not on reiterating Gurdjieff's ideas. In other words, it has ideas that originated in the writer himself, through experience, and not just experience, but 'experience digested'. The ideas, impressions, did not go just into the head, the intellect (I am sure most readers will agree that there is enough of that around already).  At the same time the book is an evaluation of the writer's inner Work over a long period of time. For me Mr. Sinclair confirms that Gurdjieff Work is not 'instant enlightenment' and waking up is a long process, where things happen as if in slow motion.  Another 'welcome' is because this book is written by 'one who never met Gurdjieff'. It is important that people like us can air our views. Perhaps we have some advantage over 'the ones that met Gurdjieff'! Maybe we can even be slightly less identified with the person and instead of following him, follow the path he followed.  The book is full of humour and I felt that this is the first book of the many that I have read, which has a strong attitude of self-criticism about the writer's relationship to his own Work and those, who are 'in it' - this I felt not as weakness, but as strength. This is the real benefit without clergy!  I found 'a long lost friend', although I never met Mr. Sinclair!  
 The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that! My whole family, kids and all, watched this with me and loved it! I can see why Yi Soon Shin is Korea's hero and why other countries teach his methods 
 Our dependence on Saudi oil makes this book even more important than ever. Gerald Posner's extensively researched "Secrets Of The Kingdom" makes me want to start riding a bicycle to work. The amazing corruption of the Saudis as well as those in our own government and big business is, at the very least shameful as well as downright criminal. Face it, they (the Saudis) literally have us over a barrel. It's time to read a book that will make you angry enough to do something about the problem and "Secrets Of The Kingdom" is the book to read. Thank you, Gerald, for opening my eyes 
 Like Clinton and GW Bush, Reagan will be argued over for decades to come.  Did he win the Cold War?  Did he bust the budgets sending us into mountains of debt?  Did he bring about the great economic times of the 1980s?  Did he just put a smile over the real problems of regular Americans?  And what about Iran-Contra?  Your answers depend on your political ideology.  Both conservatives and liberals will stretch, bend, and lie to make Reagan's achievements or dissapointments match up with their ideological bent.  These wing-nuts will ignore tons of facts that argue against their position.  This will also be the case for Clinton and GW Bush.  So it is.  Cannon, however, has written the single greatest book on the Reagan Presidency.  Unlike the liberals who took pot-shots shortly after Reagan left office, or the conservatives who are trying to rewrite the past with overly glowing accounts, Cannon wrote a book whose format should be followed for every president after they leave office: thoroughness and fairness.  Cannon, who covered the Reagan White House for the Washington Post, was so much more than just a journalist when he wrote "Role of a Lifetime."  He was part political scientist, part psychobiographer, a small part memoirist, and, indeed, he still didn't forget the writing skills of a well-trained journalist.    If you're a hardcore conservative or liberal, you will not love this book.  It doesn't kiss Reagan's ass, nor does it only tear him apart.  The man did some good and some bad in the White House.  Cannon does as good a job as possible in being fair about it.  
 This book is fast paced and really easy to read. You'll be in the plot almost all the time and also you'll learn something about the Navajo culture. The plot is not quite thrilling and it repeat itself about the slaying of a police officer in 1998 so because of this you'll have many inklings about the book's end. The end is a little lame but you'll have a good reading with this one. 
 This book was written over 70 years ago, and it's scary how close it is to reality! It pretty much predicted McCarthyism 15 years early. Also a charismatic, ultra-conservative president who is closely allied with religious extremists. President Windrip here is so close to GWB. Luckily the Patriot act and similar outrages haven't come anywhere close to the things that happen in this book. Yet..... 
 This book is a synopsis of easyt ways to evaluate and resolve conflicts in a business environment.  To the point 
 The memoir starts with a section for "rules and suggestions for enjoyment of the book." This section, as well as the acknowledgement section, gives readers an insight into Eggers humorous tone, setting us up for the remainder of the book. The thing I loved most about this memoir was Eggers' voice. He has a very distinct tone throughout the story, filled with sarcasm and wit. Although most of the conversations he adds are composed of three or four word sentences, Eggers appears to narrate every detail of what he is thinking at that exact moment. I found Eggers' sense of humor to be very refreshing, but some might not appreciate it as I did.  	Eggers' writing style constantly changes, which held my attention. There are many points throughout the memoir where he seems to go off on random tangents that have nothing to do with present story. On page 125, Eggers is suddenly convinced that his younger brother will be killed after he left him with the babysitter. He then proceeds to explain in detail what will happen when he comes home after his brother had been murdered, along with all the questions from the police. However, I think doing so lets readers see what kind of person Eggers really is. He also shows us his personality when he adds diagrams to the text to show is route of sock sliding through his home (p.65).  	Overall, I found this book to be extremely entertaining, filled with exceptional creativity and a very strong tone. This is a heavy topic, but Eggers keeps readers interested with his keen personality and creative styles displayed in this memoir. 
 In the last half of the 1990s, what with his relentless session work and his association with the whole "O Brother" crowd, fiddler Aubrey Haynie became one of those stalwart "usual suspect" studio hotshots whose names seem to appear on every 'grassy record in the world.  This solo release showcases Haynie's rock-solid musicianship... Many tracks are a bit too professional and perfect for my tastes, but there's certainly nothing "wrong" with this album.  Naturally, a whole slew of his superpicker pals are on board for the ride, including Jerry Douglas, Dan Tyminski, Bela Fleck, Rob Ickes and others.  Still, it's relatively rootsy for such an oft-times super-slick performer 
 Valuable collection of Nashs articles and academic publications. Those who are just curious about Nashs life could be disappointed to find out that just a few pages are intended to fulfill non mathematical curiosity. The initial chapters on his biography introduces some of the most elegant mathematical demonstrations in game theory and pure math 
 I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today,  combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me 
 This should be required reading analysts and associates along with `Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle' and `Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success'. Each gives a different and illuminating perspective on the ups and downs of the many different departments that make up large, institutional finance organizations. Moreover, there are in totality especially useful if you have no idea about how finance actually operates on a day-to-day basis beyond what you see in your economics courses (definitely the case at Harvard, U Chicago, MIT and the like, where these firms heavily recruit). Can definitely give those without and an internship or direct experience the ability to level the playing field to a large degree. 
 John Caples is one of advertising's greats, the author of many people's choice for the most successful ad of all time*; Vice President of BBDO for many years; and AdAge's #21 on its list of 100 Top People of the 20th Century. The world's most prestigious creative marketing award is named after him: The John Caples International Award.   He wrote several books, but Tested Advertising Methods is both his most popular and his most useful. I can't imagine a copywiter (and by that I mean anyone who ever writes copy) working without it. First, he explains that advertising is not a science, because you can never predict public opinion with guaranteed results. But you can use a scientific approach to your ads, and by testing, testing, testing them with first one headline and then another, first one offer and then another, you can arrive at an ad that is probably going to be successful. This book tells you how to do that.  Five of its 18 chapters are dedicated to writing headlines, which is as it should be. "If the headline is poor, the copy will not be read," he tells us, and offers 29 different formulas for writing good headlines. Other chapters that stand out, deal with "appealing to the masses,"  and "the right appeal." The chapter on small ads tells not only how to write them, but what sort of products to write them for.   Caples includes many famous ads, reproduced in full and accompanied by his notes on why they did or didn't work. They're a treasure chest for anyone who does his best learning by example. Many of them will sound old-fashioned ("Here's an Extra $50, Grace. I'm making real money now!"), but their basic principles are solid, and it just takes a little imagination to re-work them for today's audience.   I have a healthy collection of books on advertising, marketing and copywriting, including many of the classics. But if my library caught fire, this is the book I would try to save.    * "They Laughed When I Sat Down At The Piano..." written for the U.S. School of Music by Caples in 1921.  
 I bought so many book on how to make money and prosperity...but this is one of the best...it helped me to shift the energy and unlock the body energy...nonetheless is FANTASTIC when it explain how to become a MAGNET...AWESOME!!! QUANTUM PHYSICS AT WORK.. 
 These peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you.  My daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life.  I have eaten these when I did not have time for lunch.  They are filling and energizing and taste delicious.  You can't ask for more than that! 
 I absolutely love Playing the Quantum Field!  It's like sitting down with Brenda Anderson face-to-face and having a fascinating conversation about her life and your life and how everything that you each perceive is a part of the Quantum Field.  This is the "What the Bleep" hand-book.  It's all about the power each of us has to create our own reality.  Best thing about this book is that it's so clear and so easy that you can experience the results of your choices immediately.  I can't help but wonder what amazing transformation will take place for of us all if we get the hang of this reality-shifting business 
 There's no denying that Frederic Rolfe--the self-styled Baron Corvo--created something truly one-of-a-kind in memorable with HADRAIN THE SEVENTH, his fantastic account of an embittered marginalized crank being called upon to serve as the first English pope in centuries. In many ways, the bizarrity of this fantasy, and its undeniable stylistic maturity and complexity, make it something akin to "outsider art," the products of painters, fabricworkers and sculptors whose artworks seem a product of insanity or neurosis. The problem with Rolfe's book, however, is that as fascinating as it is intitally the novelty quickly wears off, and then you're left with chapter upon chapter left of Pope Hadrian flouncing through the Vatican making sweeping edicts and then exploring their ramifications upon Jesuitical belief--hardly the stuff of hours of reading delight 
 A+, It's a gotta have for the Sci-Fi Officianado.  The "Ender Saga" opens your eyes to human frailties, romance and Adventure. Card is a genius at Techno Speak of the future, and the Wiggin future is presented in a reality that will make you crave more. If you enjoy cutting edge science, Quantum Physics and a real belly laugh, Children of the Mind will keep you turning pages.  Pain and Peace, Fear and Foreboding, Love and Laughter, Orson Scott Card is a master and this is NOT the end 
 Spot books are very appealing to the young child.  They can't wait to read the book 
 The first time I watched this movie was on a whim and I didn't know what to expect from it. I quickly found myself becoming infatuated with the story line. Barry Levinson has created a masterpiece with this film that stars Joe Mategna, Ben Foster, Adrien Brody and Bebe Neuwirth who are theKurtzman family living in suburbian Baltimore, Maryland in a place called Liberty Heights in the year 1954. Along the way their experiences are chronicled as integration has just begun. I could go on and on, but you have got to see this movie for yourself. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed 
 I lived for singles radio in the late 60's, and the Raiders were #1 on my list...I loved EVERY hit.  One day I picked up a copy of REVOLUTION for 25 cents at a flea market, and it has been on my Top 10 all-time albums from  that day on....I was overjoyed when it was released on CD....nice bonus to  get "Ups and Downs" on the disc, too!  This album shows the  Raiders doing EVERYTHING... rock, blues, ballads, psychedelia, pop, and  even novelty songs, and every track clicks.....I don't know of a better  1:59 song than "Tighter"..... the Raiders were my favorite 60's  band, and they were never showcased better than this album.  Five stars all  the way 
 My 8 year old had this book on her school reading list.  She loved it and has read it many times.  She thought it was really funny and loved the part about the gummy worms on the pizza.  Any book that gets a child to read is all right with me 
 This is an excellent resource on self-hypnosis.  The authors have done their homework and it shows.  Their experience comes through on every page.  You get the sense that they know what they are talking about and can be of help.  I highly recommend this as one of the better books available on self-hypnosis 
 Cesar offers GREAT advice for working with your dog.  If you didn't see it yourself, you wouldn't believe it was possible.  A wonderful gift for the new dog owner on your holiday list 
 It's soft and medium-sized.  Didn't pay too much for them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over and ask if they could take one. Now I don't have any left, but they're an interseting little soft "stuffed animal" kind of thing.  No real practical purpose probably - and I heard it's a horror if it ever opens/spills its contents.  And it's kind of funny - the thing itself is soft - but it comes in a huge box with TONS of air pillows (when you order it from amazon at least).  So if you're moving and need packing material, then here's a 2-for-1 special. 
 DJ Quik comes back in 1995 with his third album "Safe+Sound."  This, arguably, is his best album.  He still uses his old-school p-funk samples, but refines and matures them.  His rhyming is so entertaining; he is light-hearted and funny.  His high-pitched rapping voice is tight and amplifies the entertainment value of the album.  This album is all G-Funk with a touch of jazz and rock & roll.  This album is the one he introduces his Roger-like talkbox that would be trademark of his later work.  I may not be a fan of "pimp" rhymes and constant "sex rap," as are commonplace in Quik's work, but even I am won over because he has such tight beats in those songs.  He also puts in several party jams that make the album fun to listen to.  He also has a few hard-core songs with awesome beats.  It's a shame he is so underrated 
 Having read innumerable Dean Koontz books over many years, I became somewhat "Koontz'd" out about 5 years ago.  I was given both The Husband and Sole Survivor as gifts by my husband, who was unaware I had decided to (temporarily or permanently) take a break from the standard Koontz-world inhabitants - nice but troubled guy, great wife/girlfriend, cute kid & wonderful dog.  However, the old attraction held and I did read both books.  As for Sole Survivor, I must say I enjoyed this book alot more than I thought I would.  The protagonist, Joe Carpenter, has lost his wife and daughters in a horrific plane crash.  A year later, he is still not coping and is just basically bitterly existing his way through his isolated life.  At a one-year anniversary visit to the cemetery, he meets the mysterious Rose, and the story begins.  What follows is a definitely exciting chase-and-run story, with plenty of horrific events and revelations, and there are definitely some edge-of-the-seat situations.  As in alot of Koontz novels, the good guy is kind of bad, and the bad guys are REALLY bad.  Amazingly, all the action takes place in the space of a few short days.  Admittedly, the final explanation is somewhat far-fetched and stretching, but it does accomplish the purpose of tying everything together at the end.  The epilogue section is also a nice touch.  I'm not saying I will instantly buy every book the incredibly prolific Koontz puts out, but this book was definitely a nice return from my Koontz-hiatus 
 I've been a devoted Scrubs fan from the get-go. It's common knowledge that their distinct brand of comedy and touching moments never fails to amaze. However, on season 4 we see the comedy come more to the forefront. But where season 3, I thought, felt a little overdramatic at times, season 4 doesn't touch on real heartbreaking moments much which does disappoint me a little. As the writers have said, they pride themselves on making things feel real, so I find it difficult to believe that working in a hospital filled with dying people that a marriage on the rocks is more important. However, it is a good and engaging storyline throughout the season.  Season 3 ended with quite the cliffhanger in which JD broke Eliot's heart. It takes a few episodes for her to forgive but I would've liked her to have held the grudge a bit longer. Other than that, both JD and Eliot move on to different people, Cox and Jordan are still together, and Turk and Carla (of course) are still holding strong. As for the janitor and Bob Kelso, they keep their usual antics up. Dr. Kelso's 'return to being a real doctor' episode surprised me though. It's hilarious but also kind of makes you look at him as more than a ball-breaker. And the janitor really pursues his crush on Eliot which is pretty funny.  With the focus seemingly strongly fixed upon comedy this time around, they came out strong. Season 3 was funny but I didn't find myself quoting it randomly like I did with 1 & 2. That magic is back thankfully. But it is a shame that there's such few touching moments. Molly Shannon's appearance was excellent with her performance showing true vulnerabilty. Past that, we can only hope season 5 can marry the two as successfully as the first two seasons did. Newcomers need not start here, go back to the beginning because you'll be lost if you start here. I'm wholly impressed with this release and Scrubs remains my favorite show on TV. Give us better extras next time 
 My children adored this book, and my grandbabies do as well.  It's particularly good for the 3 to 6 age group. It has everything--monsters, imagination, small boys.  A classic

 This is a man that could act his kiester off, Charles Laughton. He, and his wife, Elsa Lanchester, were a much more accessable version of people like Lunt and Fontaine, for Laughton's talents were obvious in every role he ever had. Don't believe me? Rent this and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", or the lighthearted "Canterville Ghost". He had a "mischievious little boy" way about him when he acted; a way of cocking his head and hedging that made you remember him as a grown-up version of little Johnny asking for more pennies to get candy. In this movie, about the legendary, edge-of-the-Renaissance painter, Rembrandt Van Rijn, his wife, Elsa, also shines as his latter-day love interest: very gentle, optimistic and almost perky. Most players in this film are good, though I feel Gertrude Lawrence overdoes it a bit, and in typical 30s Hollywood style. It's an MGM production, so I suppose overacting had to be in there SOMEWHERE, but her reading gets tiresome after awhile.  The script is full of bon mots, such as Van Rijn's short discourse of "knowing all women when you know just one..." speech, and his dressing down of the Amsterdam hoi-polloi when his masterpiece, "The Night Watch" is vainly slammed and picked apart on its first showing, but it is also good at pathos, as his beloved first wife dies and he also loses his later love, played by Lanchester.   I wish I could laud the condition of the transfer as highly, but alas, this has to be THE worst transfered DVD I have...! The highlights are WAY too bright, there are scratches and hair ghosts all through the thing, and we are cheated out of a first rate, saltine crisp print of one of Hollywood's best classic biographical films, and except for a longish movie-house trailer, there are ZERO extras in this thing. Shameful! Anyway, if you must get a copy of this film, find someone OTHER than MGM, for this transfer, plus the lack of extras, makes it less than an ideal buy! By all means, if you can find a better print transfer....BUY IT! 
 Introduction to Homeland Security provides a comprehensive view of the dynamics of homeland security in the United States from the view of experienced emergency management facilitators.  This is accomplished by providing a historical overview of the terrorist threat which culminates with the September 11th terrorist attacks and thereafter the various legislative, executive orders and organizational actions which lead to the largest re-organization of the federal government in recent history which results in the formation and creation of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  An in-depth discussion and view of the pre-Katrina DHS are provided with applicable questions regarding the functionality and capabilities of this new department.  Homeland security hazards are discussed with emphasis also placed on the safety and security of various aspects of the infrastructure of our society.  The text also discusses the addition of prevention to the comprehensive emergency management life cycle of mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.  The book concludes with a discussion of the importance of effective communications with special emphasis placed on risk communications; the various types of technology being employed and various technology players and their activities; and, provides a discussion of the future of homeland security.    This book is especially beneficial in pointing out, through probing questions, that the federal government and bureaucracy thereof, both legislative and executive, cannot remember and/or don't listen to the lessons learned of the past, which ensures that we will be repeating them again, to the suffering and detriment of our citizens.  The authors of this text were already asking questions regarding the security of our homeland in all regards, to which the answers have been so effectively pointed out through the Hurricane Katrina response and recovery failures of the DHS.  For an understanding of the dynamic that is homeland security, and the core answer to what must be done to secure our homeland this book is a must read.     
 As her Foote half-sister Opal points out, being an expert on men since she is engaged, Maine Life columnist Abby always picks losers.  One of them, Ted Puck and Mary-Kate Darling have made the wedding announcement section of the paper; Abbey knows the pair as "cheating jerk" and "cheating slut" catching them in her bed making love on her birthday.  Her siblings and "Abby Too" wish hell for Puck.  The next day Portland Police Department Detectives Benjamin Orr and Frank Fargo question Abby as someone has poisoned Ted.  Her family, friends and Maine Life peers assume Abby killed the cheating jerk and is capable of murdering others.  Though she knows Ben from when she had a crush on him in high school, Abby fears she will be railroaded so she begins her own inquiries that lead to her tripping over Big Ben as she begins to agree Opal is right that you know everything that matters about a man fifteen minutes into the first date..  Readers will know everything they need to know about charming neurotic Abby Foote in the first fifteen pages while appreciating her escapades as she tries to prove her innocence.  This amusing amateur tale displays a wild support cast who suddenly fears this mild mannered reporter has become a lethal Poison Ivy with each of them pondering if they did anything to Abby that will make them the next target.  The game's a Foote with Abby on the case, as the audience obtains a delightful romantic mystery.  Harriet Klausner 
 I was a little reluctant to read this one, mainly because I was so bored by Grisham's "The Client" and because I heard this was a "funny" book. Usually funny means excessively silly and cute.  However, just a few pages into this novel I knew it was different. Maybe becuase I could relate to the Rudy character, having graduated grad school not too long ago and having concerns about what Id be able to do with my degree, it kept me reading non-stop.   THe writing is personable, like it's really written by a young man just out of law school. The humor in it is just right, not over the top silly, but enough to make me laugh every so often. It's also fascinating material for anyone who has considered going into law ot just like watching law-based shows on TV.   A few reviewers have pointed out that there are a couple inconsistencies with the story, particularly the ending, though by that time I was more than willing to cut Grisham a little slack and overlook it. THe previous 500 pages of enjoyment I got gave him some leeway in putting together an ending that was, maybe, a little clumsy.  Whenever I read one of Grisham's novels I think that the main characters, in some way, reflect on his own experiences and opinions from when he was an attorney. All I can say is that I am very glad that the legal profession turned out not to be his true love and that he decided to become an author. I highly recommend this book 
 Sometimes they do a book and just get everything right.  Many reference works on Sci-fi are distressing by how much truly essential material is left out or ignored.  Not this one.  For instance, years ago I read an extremely early and very odd book by Philip K. Dick called THE COSMIC PUPPETS.  Most Sci-fi reading guides or dictionaries or surveys omit this title, but not this one.  I have a friend who is an exceptionally good mainstream novelist, Jack Butler, who usually publishes his highly praised and critically acclaimed works on publishers like Knopf or Penguin.  But he also published on Atlantic Monthly Press what he intended as a straightforward Sci-fi novel in the grand tradition.  Because Jack's reputation is as a mainstream writer and because it was published on a prestigious literary press, the novel was almost universally ignored by the Sci-fi community and Sci-fi reviewers (even when Gregory Benford wrote a review lavishing it with praise, it was published not in a Sci-fi mag but in the New York Times).  But when you look Jack up here they not only have a listing, they recognize the book as the superb work it is and evince an understanding that its failure in the Sci-fi community stems from marketing errors.    What I like most about the book is its combination of balanced, critical judgment on the one hand with a careful thorough-goingness on the other.  The work is too short to be completely exhaustive, but it is about a complete as a single-volume work of just under 1,400 pages can be.  It is hard to imagine how they could have done a more thorough job than they did.  The book is currently out of print, but anyone interested in Sci-fi should search out a copy.  I might go so far as to say that if you can own only one Sci-fi reference book, this is the one you should own.  I have one tiny bone to pick with the volume and one big hope for the future.  The hope first.  It is now over a decade since the book was published and we have continued to be deluged with Sci-fi novels and movies and especially television shows.  With some justification, the entries on pre-1995 television shows are either dismissive or belligerent.  Most of the good Sci-fi ever done on television has been done since 1995.  Book-wise, Sci-fi is as big business and mainstream as it has ever been.  There is simply a big need for a completely up-to-date work.  We can hope for an updated edition.  Whether it is financially feasible is another matter, but I do hope that the step is taken at some point.  And mind you, I want an updating of THIS work, not a new work by other editors.  They did it right; we just need it updated.  The tiny bone is that I wish the volume had done a bit more in guiding readers to new authors.  Some of the articles do a better job of summing up the career of a writer without letting the reader known precisely which books would be the most important to read.  Perhaps they could have put an asterisk beside the most important titles.  Some of the entries are phenomenal at letting readers know how to proceed, but it isn't carried consistently through the whole work.  But this is a minor point.  All in all this is an admirably compiled work.  As I said, if you love Sci-fi, you need this book 
 "`E' is for Evidence" is the fifth in a series of Sue Grafton's mystery novels about the loner ex-cop private detective Kinsey Millhone.  In this episode, Kinsey is framed for insurance fraud along with her high school friend's brother, Lance Wood.  As she tries to clear her name, she gets caught up in the Wood family politics and we get to see a softer side of Kinsey than she would probably care to show.  Grafton does a thorough job of developing her characters along with providing enough detail to allow the reader to feel as though he or she is actually in Santa Teresa, California.  The twists and turns that this story takes will keep you guessing until the end 
 in photek's latest release, following "form & function," he has shown interest in different sides of the electronic dance music spectrum.  in "solaris," photek experiments with house, breakbeat, and ambient sounds, as well as his signature minimalist jungle.  the first three tracks are solid breakbeat cuts, straight up, plain and simple.  "mine to give" and "can't come down" are house tracks, which aren't my favorites of the album, but are nevertheless decent.  my favorite track of this album has to be "glamourama," because i love breakbeats and photek gives it his golden touch.  plus, the track also features some eerie female vocals in italian (?).  while this album is nothing like "modus operandi" and "form & funcion," it still stands strong 
 and he was no slouch in football, first ballot hall of famer over 16,000 yards rushing. 13 seasons, 9 All Pros and a Super Bowl Champion, yet all that is nothing compared to what kind of man Walter Payton was.  In this inspiring and uplifting book we get to meet the very private Payton and get a portrait of a man of faith, values, morals and integrity. We also get to learn from someone who is facing the biggest tackler in life ( impending death) in his own words.  I cam away awed and inspired by Walter Payton and hope that kids get ahold of this book, in a time where the above qualities are rare in sports heroes, we need more heroes and Walter definantly lives up to that title.  
 This badly needed update to the classic first edition preserves what is best about the old edition, which is the format and attention to detail, and adds the changes that have occurred to the UNIX operating system since the first edition was published back in 1992. Specifically, there are implementation samples for FreeBSD, Linus, and MAC OS X included. This edition is as the first one was, an excellent reference for anyone doing system level programming in C or C++ on the UNIX platform. It is was never intended to teach the reader the fundamentals of the UNIX environment nor to teach C/C++ programming. The author assumes a strong  knowledge of both. The book begins much as the first edition did, by explaining the UNIX kernel in generic terms. It then goes on to explain the various implementations of UNIX and their specific differences. You will find chapters three through ten largely unchanged from the first edition, as the basic mechanisms of file I/O, directory structure, interprocess control, and signaling have not evolved since that time. Chapters eleven and twelve are two new added chapters on threads, as  threading has become very important in UNIX system programming. Also, gone is the chapter on interfacing to a postscript printer. It is replaced by a more modern chapter on communicating with a network printer. The HTTP protocol is discussed in this context. The book contains a rich set of examples and downloadable code that is very useful. In addition, the book contains the implementations of two large-scale projects: a database library and communication with a network printer. Each project includes complete code with schematics. This book also contains numerous exercises, and the solutions to some of those exercises are included in the back of the book. Since Amazon, and some reviewers, show the table of contents for the first edition but not the second, I include that here for the purpose of completeness: 1. UNIX System Overview 2. UNIX Standardization and Implementations  3. File I/O 4. Files and Directories 5. Standard I/O Library 6. System Data Files and Information 7. Process Environment 8. Process Control 9. Process Relationships 10. Signals 11. Threads 12. Thread Control 13. Daemon Processes 14. Advanced I/O 15. Interprocess Communication 16. Network IPC: Sockets 17 Advanced IPC 18. Terminal I/O 19. Pseudo Terminals 20. A Database Library 21. Communicating with a Network Printer Appendix A. Function Prototypes Appendix B. Miscellaneous Source Code Appendix C. Solutions to Selected Exercise 
 GenXers in politics wrestle with the apparent contradiction between the theories of modern mass media persuasion and the simpler communication practices of Jesus.  Their discoveries, contained in this book, form a virtual "how to" manual for truly loving people in an over-hyped, over-produced, mass media-saturated age.  Medefind and Locksmoe love Jesus, love people, and seek to communicate that love to the world.  I recommend this book to anyone with these same goals. 		-Matt Robbins 		M-Div Student, Fuller Theological Seminary 
 Once again, another great 80's classic, that can't seem to find it's way to DVD. Harmless pranks, good clean fun, and a bit of nudity, along with stars Phoebe Cates and Betsy Russell, make this one of the memorable films of it's kind. I guess we'll have to cross our fingers, and hope they will soon release the unrated director's cut on Blue-Ray 
 If you've never listened to Will Hoge, you don't know what you are missing.  They are the kind of band that puts you in a good mood all day.  "Blackbird on a Lonely Wire" is the kind of CD that you will let repeat in your CD player over and over and not ever get tired of it.  It definitely rocks and has a great mix of songs for everybody!! 
 Having grown up in a highly religious family with memories of church services full of fiery preaching, church politics, and hypocrisy, I've always been intrigued about the extreme faith some people have.  It doesn't get much more extreme than the small circle of Southern churches that handle venomous snakes to get closer to God.  The subject matter could come across in some ways comical, like those muscular "Power Team" christians who pray for strength and break 2x4s in football arenas.  But the author presents a unique subject in a unique way--he grew up in the Appalachian hills and in the course of the story, even finds out his relatives have played a part in the snake handling history.  He even buys into the experience given his spiritual needs of the moment and describes first-hand the fear and loss of fear through faith when handling the snakes in moments of religious ecstasy.  This is a thoroughly fascinating book like few others.  In a lot of ways, this book is similar to another fantastic book, "Violent Faith" by Jon Krakauer who wrote about the Mormon Fundamentalists and their bloody history and disfunction.  Only in this book, Covington becomes the center of the story, not just the reporter.  I can understand how this fine book was considered for the National Book Award 
 Morris west was one of the best and this last one proves the point. This is his last book and he has proved himself yet again as the master of vatican suspense. Many of his books are superb and modelled after part fiction and part christian history. 
 While in Ireland, a bodhran player recommended KILA to me as an exciting and unique Irish band and he especially praised "Tog E Go Bog E".  Like all Irish music it is full of motion and rhythm, but much more complex and compelling.  These are accomplished musicians who weave and build their songs into a sound that can physically be felt.  To see them live, like I did in Dublin, is an experience I do not ever think I'll match again 
  This book has some great stories which are heart warming and meaningful for the soul. These stories are way for people to see that animals can truly love there human. I would give this book out for gift to people who are lonely and think that nobody can love them. 
 Jahoda's "Trail of Tears" is a good companion to Dee Brown's "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" - in fact, Brown basically picks up where Jahoda leaves off both chronologically and geographically. Although hardly comprehensive (such an account of the Indian removals east of the Mississipi would require many volumes), Jahoda nonetheless provides a rather exhaustive review of the removal of the "five civilized tribes" as well as a number of midwestern peoples. Jahoda notes the particular senselessness of 'removing' the eastern tribes, as many had already been integrated into the lifestyle of the American settlers (some even became major plantation owners, complete with slaves) and/or became devout Christians. What comes out here is that it was not a matter of dealing with 'savages' but racism, plain and simple. Needless to say, "Trail of Tears" is not only an illuminating history but also a rather instructive text 
 I had an urgent need for a cable to connect an old parallel printer to a USB-only equipped computer.  The printr used a non standard cable connection at the printer and Tiger had just the cable I needed to bridge the gap at a price that was much less than Circuit city and the like.  Delivery was prompt and reasonable 
 This CD is yet another great CD in the Smithsonian Folkways Collection. The re-issue of Sam Minton's folk songs for children is welcome retreat into traditional songs and stories so easily lost in our technological and highly-automated society.  There are 20 songs to enjoy on this CD. Minton interprets classic folk songs with a unique sound and delightful humor. If you can keep up with his singing, which is no easy task on some of the more silly tunes, you can try to sing these to with your children. No doubt, you will all laugh at these efforts, but it will be fun trying!  Of course, if you can't keep up with Minton's singing on this CD, and you make up your own verses or choruses, that is exactly his point. As Minton said, "I am passing these songs on to you, in hope that....you will make some of them your own songs, and that you may pass them along to future boys and girls who will call you their ancestors."  I enjoyed all the tracks on this CD except the one about the graveyard called "Old Boastun Was Dead." Maybe I am a bit faint of heart, but I didn't think my little one was ready for the frightful images in that song. Of course, Minton's audience might be older kids ready for a good scare.  Sam Minton's music brings children's music back to its roots, in classic, simple acoustic arrangements that are sure to entertain your family.--Katy Farber  
 I watched this movie just recently with friends and we are all in our seventies or approaching.  We grew up with Elvis, Jerry Lee, Johnny Cash and the bunch of them.  This was our time, our clothes, the whole nine yards.  We laughed our heads off and had the best, best time hearing the music again, picking up the little bits taken from other movies (like the T-birds from Grease).  Why this has not become a classic of some sort of those of our age is beyond me.  But there is still time to really enjoy this movie and hoot and holler and just roll with it.  Cool!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Even if you do not read historic novels you will love this one. The author lets you see inside the characters so it is history book that is nothing like the ones you read in school 
 Working perfect, amazing the amount of space in pictures you can have!! Great product, more than enoug 
 Although I think Gilad is a little goofy, this is the best exercise DVD I have used/own. The reason why is because: - he warns you of a change in step before it happens and he's consistent about this - his counting is never off - or at least I haven't discovered any counting errors - the videographers don't try to get artsy with the cuts, so there is never a cut at the outset of a new step or a transition between steps (I haven't found any other exercise DVD that can boast this and this is important if you want to learn the steps and keep up) - although the steps themselves are realitively simple, the way Gilad combines them is quite challenging cardio-wise - the overall combinations are fun  The only thing you need to know about him is that he will say that you're getting ready to do the "last one;" and instead of meaning the very last step, he means the last combination of steps (one to each side, left and right). So for instance, if you are stepping up on the step and kicking with, first the left foot, and then you switch to the right foot (step up and kick). Instead of the final right foot kick being the "last one," Gilad means the last set of left and right kicks. (I hope that made sense. If you get the DVD, I think it will. 
 David Shirreff was one of the first and remains one of the few journalists to tackle the challenging subject of financial risk. In this book, he collects material from articles he published during the 1990s (a period of astonishing innovation in the field), supplemented by interviews with some of the true luminaries in the areas of financial engineering and financial risk management. Shirreff is a lucid writer with a sharp and concise style. He has the rare gift of making the complexities of finance accessible to a general readership. Therefore, we recommend this book both to financial professionals and to general readers who have an interest in the subject 
 very easy to read and follow, exellent summary of the essential facts and good practice questions good for preparing of any postgraduate exams in physiology highly recommended 
 If you're into melodic, funky and hard-driving rock with incredibly soulful vocals and tasty musicianship - - Glenn Hughes "R.O.C.K."(Return Of Crystal Karma) is, without a doubt, the best thing to come out in perhaps a decade.  Not since LIVING COLOR's "Vivid" has an album been more complete in all of these points, and it actually eclipses the monumental release by LC in all areas mentioned.  Glen Hughes is downright schizophrenic in regards to being musically multi-dimensional, and approaching different genres on different albums with the same reckless abandon and supreme competency (whether it be R&B, Funk, Blues, Rock, Hard Rock or Heavy Metal).  If you are a fan of any of these musical catagories, Glenn Hughes' offerings in each are sure to make you nod your head and go "Yeh!" while you listen (sometimes screaming your affirmation). On this album, you'll hear what I feel are some of Glenn's best bass work and best vocals (no small task) to date.  The drumming of Gary Ferguson is about as in-the-pocket as humanly possible, and the production on the drums are outstanding.  The guitar work of J.J. Marsh cooks with some serious grease, and solos on "This Life" and "Days Of Avalon" can only be described as actual pieces ripped from this man's soul (while the instrumental "Owed to 'J' " is like the listening equivalent for guitar of watching an olympic gymnastics event).  Go to "It's Alright" as the first cut you listen to, and work your way around from there.  All 10 cuts are great, but if that one doesn't hook you... give it up 'cause you aint got NO soul at all 
 'Home Cooking' by Laurie Colwin is the kind of book that really makes you wish you could become friends with the author. Unfortunately, the author is no longer with us, so there is a lot more than the usual barrier between celebrity and mere mortal between reader and writer.  The chapters in the book are essays composed of both culinary and autobiographical material, although the book is not a memoir a la Ruth Reichl's two books. It is also not culinary criticism or exposition in the style of John Thorne. It is most similar to the kind of essays written by Elizabeth David, one of the author's heroes, and M.F.K. Fisher.  The author has the advantage of most good writers in that she has lived in interesting circumstances providing fuel for her writing. One premise for much of her culinary advice is based on the fact that for several years, she lived in a very small Greenwich Village apartment with no oven, two hot plates, no sink and a tiny refrigerator, with literally enough room to hold no more than three people at a time. Amazingly, the author was able to actually entertain in this tiny space, using the bathtub and commode as a means of washing up the dishes.  Much of the culinary advice is quirky and some is actually a bit dated, as it predates the microplane and the cheap plastic mandoline. I suspect the author may have changed some of her opinions if these tools had been available. Colwin's advice about knives is also a little dated, as she swears by carbon steel blades rather than modern stainless steel. Since there is no evidence that she sharpened her own knives, I suspect a modern Santoku knife may have changed her opinion. Even so, the essays are a testament to cooking with only the bare minimum of equipment and space.  It is not surprising that Ms. Colwin's recipes never made the 'Best of' series, as they are quirky rather than true gourmet fare. While another of Ms. Colwin's heroes is Edna Lewis, the very influential writer on Southern cooking, Ms. Colwin's recipe for Southern Fried Chicken does not follow Ms. Lewis' lead on a number of things such as an overnight buttermilk marinade. He does, however, keep to the gospel of pan frying rather than deep-frying.  Ms. Colwin's writing provides much more food for the soul than it does food for the gut. Reading this book makes one wish that Karen Duffey would have channeled her not inconsiderable talent for the simple in her book 'A Slob in the Kitchen' into a style more like Ms. Colwin's very entertaining twists on culinary matters.  Highly recommended reading for foodies. 
 Philosophy, international labor, high tech, economics, globalization, the internet and virtual universes are all neatly wrapped together in this book.  It is a very successful telling by Mr. Dibbell of what is going on right now...not just in the MMO world but in many aspects of society.  It was so fascinating for me to read.  He did not hype up the metaverse phenomenon.  But, he did make it a bit less complicated.  You really get the message that what is currently undergoing is not trivial and has serious implications to how we all live our lives.  Play versus work, the lines are getting more blurry.  But, it might not necessarily be a bad thing.  If "Liar's Poker" is the must read for the financial markets, "Play Money" should definitely be the counterpart for virtual economies.  
 In my humble opinion, the very best work that examines this mass media form and how it reflected the changes in American culture during the past six decades. Wright has done meticulous research but presents his material in such an easy style that it is easy to forget that this is a scholarly tome. Highly recommended 
 I bought this grill for my husband.  Even though we already had a Weber, I thought he might appreciate the added features this one offers.  I was right.  He raves about it every time he uses it! 
 hey, does anyone know what the name of the song played inthe 2 fast 2 furious trailor/preview is 
 I found Blogging for Business to be enjoyable and quite helpful. I don't have a technical background and I thought I might find the content confusing and/or tedious, but the authors have made it easy for Luddites like me to get on top of this blogging thing. Now I'm using blog data regularly for business purposes (although I have yet to set up one of my own) and it's been surprisingly useful.   I've no doubt we'll be seeing an overabundant supply of books published on this topic, but I recommend you pick this one up. The language is breezy and droll, which makes it a fun read, but the business application is quite powerful.  
 I'm sure lot's of other people have written vast amounts on the plot of this book, so I'll try and keep it brief. For people who loved The Shawshank Redemption, King returns to writing a story about prison in the 30's. Only this time it's the death row prison, where inmates have short stays.  A truly compelling story from page to page. Originally it was a serial novel, split into 6 parts. The parts are in the complete novel and while sometimes there is backtracking and reiterating it does not lessen the book's qualitites.  What you have here is King writing as only he does. His ability to take the odd/supernatural and mix it with rich characters and interesting plots, is why he is such an acclaimed and loved author. I'm sure many people have seen the film version of this book and while it is one of the most faithful to his work, I still think that reading the book would be better. I read many books a year and it's rare that one can actually make me tear up, but The Green Mile made me do just that. You will not be disapointed if you read this 
 ok, so people who don't like this film are retards. seriously. this movie is SO MUCH FUN! it's the best dark comedy, like, ever! gregg araki is a genius, his use of color and humor juxtaposed with ultra-violent images makes for a jolting ride, but in the end it's all in good fun. ok, so maybe his movies aren't for everyone, but to deny his genius is LUDICROUS! 
 this movie is a very realistic one. from the omaha beach scene to the last village scene! although the omaha beach sce was very very graphic, i still taught me that war is hell. the only nasty super graphic part is when that guy gets shot up and his intestines are falling out every where. great movie 
 I found this book to be a very good complement to my Organic Chemistry Class. It provides you with many examples, and lays out the important information needed for each topic. I am able to comprehend the concepts learned in class much easier because of it.   Highly Recommended 
 For fans of 'The King of Hollywood' this set will no doubt seem way overdue. The titles chosen for this collection vary in appropriateness for inclusion, the comedy 'Wife Vs. Secretary' is only a so-so film that is made worthwhile only by the quality of the cast ie Gable, Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow. Also with the long-lost Harlow, Gable stars in the sillier than silly 'China Seas' in which he plays a ship's captain.  Mogambo is a universally appreciated 1953 remake of an earlier Gable film (this time with Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly) in which he reprises his original role. A vast improvement of the original.  Dancing Lady is an underrated 1933 comedy classic with Joan Crawford in a change of pace comedic turn that she pulls off marvellously. When Gable slaps her butt after granting her a favour and she wistfully thanks him; priceless! All in all this a set of classics that should please Gable's fans and those who just enjoy great vintage entertainment alike 
 One of the best hard rock albums every recorded. Every song is like a greatest hits album. Can't recommend this enough of fans of good hard rock bands such as Y&T, Thin Lizzy, UFO etc. Some call this band a thrash band but I never thought of them as that. It's just very good melodic fast hard rock. It's the best Riot album they ever made. Too bad Guy Sperenza didn't stay with them longer because I feel they were peaking when they made this.  If you never heard it you don't know what your missing. 
 Most books and articles on experiment design spend very few, if any, pages on experiment design.  Instead, they describe a myriad of existing experiments and leave the reader to select from some sort of catalogue.  After that, they move directly into the analysis of experimental data.  Well, no amount of analysis is going to salvage data collected from an inappropriate design, and a more frequent problem, analyzing data with techniques that don't reflect how the experiment was actually conducted can lead to misleading, if not irreproducible results.  With Dr. Lorenzen's approach, the practitioner can create an initial design, review its utility as well as short-comings and then proceed through enough iterations to converge at the best set of trade-offs for their situation.  As one example, classic texts discuss "Completely Randomized Designs" in one chapter and then "Split Plots" in another, without addressing why one might choose one over the other.  Without this guidance, people tend to overwhelm true experimental signals with controllable errors or trade off diagnostic ease for difficulties in changing configurations in real-world settings like manufacturing plants and test facilities.    You're better off understanding the building blocks of variable types, nesting, restrictions on randomization and so forth as described in this text.  After that, you're well equipped to both design and accurately analyze the data you've taken.  Now that's efficiency 
 I bought this book sight unseen as a "twofer."  To my surprise it is THE best book full of practical, simple patterns for babies from newborn (a hard size to find) through 24 months.  I highly recommend it for your knitting library 
 I bought the Batmobile pedal car for a friend's son for his birthday.  I wanted to get something that would be fun and cool for him but not too annoying for mom.  Since he watches the Batman cartoon on TV I figured the Batmobile pedal car was perfect.  He loves it!  He is always making up stories about chasing the bad guys and incorporating the sound effects from the toy.  It's so cute.  My friend also liked that it had pedals to encourage a little more activity while he played.  I would definately recommend this to other shoppers 
 Shadow of the Giant is once again a perfect book by Orson Scott Card. I ejoyed this book very much and I think that everyone who has read the Ender series should read thsi book. It starts and ends very well and it gives the sense of peace in the end. this is probably one of the best book in the series, at least it was for me.  This book is mainly centered around Bean and Petra. Bean is soon going to die because of his disease. The Anton's key. Before he dies though he has many things to accomplish. He must help bring about world peace with Peter and he must find his babies taht are filled with the same disease as he has right now. He finds his babies eventually and then he is sent to outer space so taht he will not age as fast as on Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth Petra is taking care of the babies that don't have the disease and Petra has remarried just as Bean wanted. Peter dies after all the things he does and Petra is left again. Alone and full of sadness 
 Faust is just an incredible accomplishment in the art of silent cinema, one of the most ambitious and masterfully directed films of any era.  If you've never seen a silent film and wonder if one could even keep your attention, Faust is the film to watch.  Far too many classic early films were either lost or came to us in relatively poor condition, but this digitally mastered version of Faust is remarkably clear and free of white outs.  I'm sure it looks better now that it did when it was released over eight decades ago.  Don't go thinking we're only talking about characters standing around conversing, either; F. W. Murnau packed all kinds of incredible special effects into this magnificent piece of filmmaking.    You all know Faust - that fellow who made a deal with the devil.  The story goes back as far as the fifteenth century, with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe penning the definitive version in the early nineteenth century.  Murnau's Faust differs somewhat from the original two-part drama written by Goethe, supplanting rationalism with mysticism (no one did mysticism better than early German filmmakers).  This approach, among other things, allows Murnau to open the film with nothing less than jaw-dropping visuals and effects.  The story is heralded by the grim image of the apocalyptic horsemen thundering through the clouds, leading us to a confrontation between Mephisto (Satan) and an archangel over the control of the Earth.  A wager is proposed, with dominion over the Earth set to depend upon the fate of one man's soul.  That man is, of course, Faust, a good man targeted for evil temptation by the cursed one.  Knowing he could not tempt Faust directly, Mephisto uses his own compassion against him.  As a devastating plague is unleashed among Faust's fellow citizens, Mephisto casts his dark shadow over the landscape quite literally, as we see him hovering over the entire village.  That, to me, is one of the most memorable and iconographic cinematic sights I've ever seen.    As his friends and neighbors beg Faust (Gosta Ekman) to save them from the plague, his unanswered prayers bring him to the point of despair.  He actually summons Mephisto himself (in another incredible special effects-laden scene).  After some deliberation, Mephisto (Emil Jannings) convinces Faust to sign a pact for one day only, and that proves to be an offer Faust can't refuse.  A little later, though, Mephisto brings in the big guns - the promise of restored youth.  Extending the contract from one day to eternity is basically just a formality at this point.  All of his new powers don't truly satisfy Faust, though, and so he sets his sights on a lovely, pure maiden by the name of Gretchen (Camilla Horn).  The whole mood of the film changes at this point, with the art of wooing temporarily displacing the clouds of doom hanging over the first half of the film - but this is only a prelude to true tragedy.  As Daniel Johnston says, "Don't play cards with Satan, he'll deal you an awful hand," and that is exactly what happens here.  It gets pretty darned depressing, really, making it hard for the viewer to see how Faust can possibly redeem himself for all of the misery he has caused.  Murnau doesn't pull any punches when it comes to establishing the central theme of the story.  Thanks to earlier successes such as Nosferatu and The Last Laugh, Murnau had complete control over the making of Faust.  Something of a perfectionist, Murnau made sure that every aspect of every single shot met with his satisfaction.  It's obvious that the man was a genius, as even the contrast of light and shadow reinforces the central motif of the story he is telling.  The special effects seem years and years ahead of their time.  Even the makeup is remarkably well-done (I would never have guessed that Gosta Ekman played both the old and young versions of Faust, as the older version looks genuinely old).  And the acting?  Top-notch, all the way.  Ekman is superb, Emil Jannings becomes the very personification of Mephisto, and an inexperienced Camilla Horn is simply enchanting as Gretchen.  (The role of Gretchen was actually written for Lillian Gish, but she bowed out because Murnau refused her demand to have her own personal cameraman shoot the film.)  The musical score, composed and conducted by Timothy Brock, is a wonderful counterpart to the film, as well.    In virtually every way possible, F.W. Murnau's Faust is nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece 
 In this entertaining volume, Wilkens portrays the thought and work of ten well-known philosophers (the Greeks, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Kieerkegard, Nietzsche, Marx and Sartre), and interprets some of their ideas in the light of the Christian truth.  Although I have always believed that it is better to read directly an author than a book dissecting that author's work, this book delivers a good amount of pertinent and thought stimulating insights about the relations between philosophy and Christianity.  The book has, among many others, two important virtues: Wilkens lets every author explain himself (by quoting a fair amount of their works) and keeps the discussion simple, yet never superficial. This book is a well written, entertaining and very practical work, the perfect introduction to some key thinkers just in case you're not planning to read them soon, or just want to give them a chance in an simple and entertaining way.  It is a shame that, apart from Sartre, no other 20th-Century philosopher is assessed.  It would be great to have a sequel of this book, dedicated to a Christian evaluation of postmodern philosophers (see Millard Erickson's "Truth and Consequence" in that sense) 
 This is one of the best sophomore level o-chem text available. The explanation is clear and the writing style is straight-forward. The organization of the topics is somewhat different from the traditional functional group approach. This helps students to apply what they learn early in the course to the reactions in later chapters. I don't see how anyone who is ready to take o-chem can be confused by this organization unless his/her instructor takes a very different approach from the textbook itself. The answers to the problems are certainly not error free. But keep in mind, when you read anything written by today's college students, reduce the magnitude by at least 10 times to come even close to what they are trying to say. Our English language will soon lose any meaning if this trend of exageration doesn't stop soon. I am also not surprised that most students cannot learn organic chemistry on their own from this textbook. No other textbook would do either. Going to class is absolutely essential (if instructors can be understood by students) besides working lots of problems and learning to think. 
 I recommend this book to anyone who wants to increase their sexual excitement. My wife bought this book and WOW!!! She is my Fountain of Youth 
 I bought these separately before the package was made. I am not normally a fan of packaging unless it is a series or some other theme. However there is not a clinker in the bunch. I suggest you look at the individual reviews. However for those that are in a hurry:  Casablanca: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman - Two people fall in love during war France as the Nazis are invading. They meet again in Casablanca the last outpost on the way to freedom. There is mystery, intrigue subterfuge and the beginning of a beautiful friendship.  The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor - Sam Spade (Bogart) is accused of murdering his partner, murdering a suspect, and down right sneakiness. He is trying to find out why everyone is looking for the black bird. In the process he falls in love with Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor). Will they find the thing that dreams are made of? A remake of the 1931 version.  The Philadelphia Story: Socialites Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn - A 1940 screen adaptation of The Philadelphia Story. C. K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) and Tracy Samantha Lord (Katherine Hepburn) get divorced. Now Tracy is going to marry George Kittredge, who worked his way up the corporate latter to the top of a mine. C. K. brings people from Spy magazine to cover the event. The fun begins as every one has second thoughts. And Wicked Uncle Willie is available.  Arsenic and Old Lace: Cary Grant, Raymond Massey, Peter Lorre - A Halloween tale. A critic of marriage gets married, and then he finds out that insanity runs in the family as two branches of the family compare body counts. This really is a comedy. They could not get Boris Karloff; however Raymond Massey does just as well.  And don't forget Dr. Einstein (auch der lieber).  The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall - A 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel. Private-eye Philip Marlowe (Bogart) is hired to keep an eye on Carmen (Martha Vickers), youngest daughter of General Sternwood (Charles Waldron), and you guessed it falls in love with older sister. Lots of sub plots. "You go too far, Marlowe."  Now, Voyager: Betty Davis, Paul Henreid - Based on the novel by Olivia Higgins Prouty. I think one of the shockers for me was when Charlotte Vale was forced to remove her eye glasses to find she did not need them. "Don't ask for the moon--we have the stars"  Citizen Kane: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton - A story is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Because of its popularity as an art film many people have trouble just watching it as the story. Watch it to find out what is meant by Rosebud. 
 In Baby Buddhas: A Guide For Teaching Meditation To Children, author Lisa Desmond draws upon her more than 25 years of experience and expertise teaching meditation to children ages 18 months to three years, and children preschool through eight grade, to instruct parents and care givers on how to go about teaching preschool-aged children on how to meditate. Simple guidelines for setting up a meditation space, learning specific terms, specific meditations for adults (sending love to a child, cherishing hope for world peace) and children ('OM', cleansing breath, catching blessings, and much more) fill this gentle and patient guide to balancing family and spiritual needs. Color photographs, creative ideas, and guidelines round out an all-around superb guide for parents. 
 Ted Greene's marvelous books have become staples in guitar instruction, starting with the famous "Chord Chemistry" (Ted frequently referred to the book as "Chord Catastrophe").   "Single Note Soloing, Volume 1" is the perfect book for those that are interested in jazz and have experience playing the guitar, but want to learn the ins and outs of jazz phrasing. The musical examples in this book (all in notation, no TAB here) are great and Ted's comments include a wealth of information about left and right hand tips, phrasing ideas, and how to use the examples. A pleasant "side effect" of going through this book is your sight-reading will noticably improve, especially in the higher positions (such as the 7th, 8th, and 9th). And for those who might already know the theory involved, it makes a for a great warmup and provides a refresher course in important fundamentals. Even though I knew most of the theory in the book when I first went through it, it was a great learning experience because it filled up the holes in my knowledge, some that I didn't even know were there. That is part of the greatness of Ted Greene. Never does the book have a pretentious or snobby air to it, and his thoughts are always encouraging and inspiring when you read them. Many guitar books create more holes than fill them, because the authors themselves do not have the needed grasp of the fundamentals. There's no need to worry about that here, as Ted was a master at learning (and therefore, teaching) things the right way.   Overall this has to be one of the best books on the subject that I've gone through, especially for a book that is guitar-specific. If you could only choose one book on jazz scales for guitar, choose this one. 
 First of all, if the negative reviewers were such experts in the field, they probably wouldn't be looking for opportunities, so they wouldn't really need this book! I love it when I hear reviewers call something "dated" or "for beginners"...Well if they don't deserve a big pat on the back.  For those who are looking for a little more than something to criticize, this book is ABSOLUTELY LOADED with REAL, LEGITIMATE, BONE FIDE home based business opportunities. If you are still relatively new to the world of working from home, then these opportunities could not possibly be "dated" (that's just ridiculous).  I have spent thousands of dollars on the internet with so called "gurus" and "mentors" whose only real purpose is to keep you ignorant while they empty your wallet... and I am convinced that almost all of them are really clueless about professional entrepreneurship.  The Authors have dealt with computer businesses (from home) in a very refreshing way. No hype, no bull, no gimmicks, no come ons, no fog, no smoke screens, just 101 opportunities to make working from home a reality for you.  If you can't get your seventeen bucks out of this book, then you don't need to be wasting your time trying to act like an entreprneur... cause you won't make it.  Here's some advice. Go through the 101 businesses in the book, pick the ones you are interested in, and then sit at your computer and bookmark all the web sites they mention after each entry, including all the books (look them up on Amazon and then bookmark the pages for later).   By this time you will have yourself a nice little rolodex of tools to begin putting to use in your new profession. I guarantee you that this alone will have paid for the price of the book. And no, the businesses aren't dated. They are actually only the tip of the ice berg.  One more thing. Just a few years ago, two of the biggest names in Direct Marketing were saying the internet was just a fad that would pass. Kind of shocking to think that such "gurus" are so ignorant. No surprise to me, as I know the truth about these fellas. Anyway those with that limited sight are going to say a book like this is dated, because they can't see what's going on in the world around them.  But you are different. You are going to strike gold, by listening to these trustworthy authors and taking their advice. Because friend, there just aren't too many authorities in the world of business and marketing who you can really trust at all. Everything that they say or do has a hidden motive behind it, and it sure isn't your best interests either.  Paul and Sarah Edwards have given some really powerful guidance. What you do with it is up to you. Sure there will be alot of education required, but not nearly as much as would be required by going it alone. I hope you buy this book and I wish you well.  
 This was a satisfactory book with funny dialogue. What I really enjoyed was how I could relate to the character being the new girl in school and the author articulated the awkwardness of not having any friends in a class or not knowing how to join in on a converation well.  The book was a fairy tale. It's one of the things that I didn't really like. Lucy's instant rise from friendless to being best friends with the most popular girls in school and being the girlfriend of the hottest guy is really unrealistic. It just doesn't happen like that in real life. Also the cruelty of her stepmother and her father's refusal to listen to her when they were supposedly very close was a bit strange. When you then add the ending where everything suddenly seems dandy and Lucy goes from toying with the idea of asking her boyfriend to kill her stepmother to hugging her stepmother lovingly, well it's a bit much. Dare I say it was almost too corny for me. But hey it's supposed to be a kind of a modern day cinderella fairy tale so I shouldn't have have expected realism and it ended happily ever after. This book was an easy read, it probably took me about 2-3 hours in one sitting to read it. I wouldn't buy it. I got it from the library and enjoyed it to a certain degree but would never want to read it twice.  
 This is the 2nd Sandra Browne book that I read - the first one being Chill Factor.  Both were very well written, and this book, Riccohet, keeps you in suspense throughout - going up and down hills and making U-turns all of the time.  If I had to nitpick anything, it was just a tad long in the middle, but picked right up again and took you on yet another journey.  I am very much looking forward to Ms. Brown's next book.  She is an excellent writer and one of my favorites as I enjoy her writing.  Keep up the good writing . . .  Mary San Clemente, C 
 Being a lover of medieval history, when I bought this book and sat down to read it I was expecting perhaps, another somewhat dry and unexciting account of the daily life of a medieval woman living in a medieval town. Wow! Was I pleasantly surprised! This little book is a real gem as it recounts, in modern English and in biographical narrative fashion, the travels and tribulations of a truly remarkable, if a bit eccentric, Englishwoman of the 15th century. I especially enjoyed the description of her journey to and sojourn in the Holy Land and her stay in Rome. This woman, who was subject to visions of and visitations from the saints and Jesus, would likely be declared insane today, and she almost was burned as a heretic back then. Her courage and fortitude are truly admirable. Ms. Collis has done a masterful job of weaving quotes from Margery's autobiography with modern English prose to present a lucid and most enjoyable account of this lady. Definitely a two thumbs up book! 
 One of the best rap cd's I have ever heard.  Chuck D, as always, delivers a dominating vocal performace.  When Chuck talks, you listen.  There is certainly a more modern and less abrasive sound to this disc in comparison with some earlier PE recordings.  As expected, the lyrics are political and even more on the mark than usual.  The beats are incredible almost without exception.  Favorite tracks include Unstoppable (KRS-One gives great guest vocals), Is Your God a Dog, House of the Rising Son, Game Face, Politics of the Sneaker Pimps, What You Need is Jesus.  The title track is also great -- I've just burned myself out from hearing it a lot.  The tracks not mentioned are also very good, better than the vast majority ...that passes as rap these days.  Highly recommended 
 Prof. Colaiaco teaches in the Great Books program at NYU.  His experience teaching high-level undergraduates shows in this book, which is very accessible to the educated non-specialist who wants to know why Socrates is so important.  The book is organized chronologically, following the events of the trial as they are presented to us in the dialogues of Plato.  The style is clear and concise.  There are copious footnotes, 670 of them in 227 pages, but they are all pertinent and they do not interfere significantly with the narrative flow.  There is an extensive bibliography, almost as valuable as the narrative itself, for those interested in pursuing further study of Socrates.  Prof. Colaiaco deeply admires Socrates, holds him up as the first example of principled opposition by the individual to arbitrary state power.  He is disappointed by Socrates' provocation of the jury into sentencing him to death, and in Socrates' refusal to accept exile as an alternative.  Yet Colaiaco shows that the outcome was inevitable, given the desperate political situation of Athens at the time, and Socrates' stubborn lifelong mission to save the souls of his fellow citizens.  Colaiaco notes that the jury was obligated to make a decision that was in the best interest of the Athenian polis, not in the best interest of justice.  This illustrates just how different Athenian legal and political ideas were from our own, even though Athens was a democracy.  Under the Athenian legal system, the law was whatever the Athenian jury, chosen by lot, said it was on the day it rendered its verdict, and there was no appeal.  Our concept of justice as "equality before the law" did not come into existence until some generations later, and then not in Athens, but in Rome.  I was disappointed that Prof. Colaiaco didn't comment on Socrates' last words, telling Crito to sacrifice a cock to Aesclepius.  Socrates was no doubt being ironic, as always, but what did he mean?  That his soul had been healed?  That he was "cured" finally of the "illness" of life?  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the sources of the Western tradition we all share.  Related reading:  Gregory Vlastos:  "The Historical Socrates and Athenian Democracy" in his book "Socratic Studies".  This is aimed at the  specialist, is more demanding than Colaiaco, but just as interesting.  I do not recommend I.F. Stone's book on Socrates [...]  If you must read Stone, read Colaiaco and Vlastos first.  A.E. Taylor's "Socrates" is [...] dated, but still interesting. 
 The CD I bought is wonderful, new just like described. The David Bowie/Bing Crosby Christmas Song and video, "Peace on Earth" is one of my all time favorites and I am glad I now have it. Thanks much...  
     I first heard "Barry Farms" first on KCRW in L.A...then ran out and bought the CD.  I am now arranging a cover for my band.  Will have to have to give it to our male singer for most venues.  I wonder if our female singer would do this one?      Bravura lyrics on the theme of Lesbian relationships, (toasted the ears of this middle-aged white male doctor). Sensual but sophisticated, in no way obscene. Amazing.   esp. "Barry Farms" and "Pocketbook".      Very stylish jazz twists and turns in otherwise raw, throbbing hip-hop rhythms.  First rate jazz instrumentalists. Michelle's voice is the Anita Baker of street-rap. Hip-hop for adults.     Very, very original material and style.   (The righteous political/ghetto rhetoric on some cuts is sincere but has been done before.  She should stick to her wry, I-don't-care ironic style when getting into done-before topics.)      At least 6-8 first rate cuts on this long album.  Definitely not for kids, in every sense of the word. Worth every penny.  Still amazes me a year later.      
 There is so much more to this movie that anyone gives it credit for. When you mention Friday the 13th, many people either dismiss it for being "just a slasher flick" or a "Halloween rip-off." Most people do not see the artistic value in Friday the 13th because they simply do not expect it to be in this kind of movie or do not want to acknowledge it, as a result of already having their closed (typical critic know it all) minds made up.  First off, Friday the 13th is not a Halloween rip-off. When Carpenter's equally classic Halloween generated top box office revenue in 1978 and 1979, many eyebrows raised within the film industry. Among those were the brows of a few people in particular. Sean (director) Cunningham, Victor (credited writer) Miller, Ron (unaccredited writer) Kurz, Steve (producer) Miner, and Georgetown (independent film production company) Productions all wanted in on the profit made by the Halloween. The only sensible thing they could think of doing was to produce a similar product, which became Friday the 13th.  Sean wanted to make the same kind of money that John made, but he knew he would have to make his film a little different. Instead of just having a walking masked madman on the loose, he and Victor came up with a story that is quite brilliant. Sure, certain scenes in Friday the 13th may have been taken from Halloween, but you can say the same thing about Halloween taking some scenes from Psycho. Friday the 13th, whether it was on purpose or not, utilized a couple of really good themes in their story telling, beyond the typical moral theme that everyone associates with these movies like sex leads to death.  The first theme that Friday the 13th throws in your face is the idea of isolated mass hysteria. Camp Crystal Lake and the town of Crystal Lake are haunted. They are not haunted by ghosts and goblins, but by unsuppressed dark memories of a little boy drowning and a string of unsolved murders among other things, in which all have to do with Camp Crystal Lake. Every person in town believes that there is a "Death Curse" upon the camp, and they refer to the place as "Camp Blood." When Annie walks into the restaurant and asks some people how she can get to Camp Crystal Lake, they all look at her and two people try to warn her to stay away from the place. They say the place is jinxed and has a death curse.  Psychology is only a little more then 100 years old, but we know that parents have a strong "connection" to their child even after the umbilical chord is severed. For a parent to have to burry their own child is probably the most devastating thing that can happen in their life. Mrs. Voorhees looses her son to a tragedy and little by little she snaps. She tries to give him life by giving him a voice at one point (just like Norman Bates did for his mother in Psycho), and that voice tells her to murder those responsible for her son's death.  Of course for the horror fan there is enough blood and murder to please. All in all Friday the 13th is a powerful tragic but frightening story of love, loss, superstition, and murder with an ending that is sure to make one jump (no pun intended) right out of one's seat. Also, not revealing the murderer until the end makes the film more suspenseful then showing the murderer in the opening sequence like Halloween did 
 It is symptomatic of what is wrong with country radio that "Long Slow Kisses" did not reach #1 (it stayed on the charts forever, topping out just short of the top ten) although some would argue that the fault lies with RCA/BMG because the album was two years old already before RCA/BMG started pushing the song. Anyway, this is a terrific album with Bates' voice being reminiscent of Conway Twitty without it being a clone. "My Inlaws Are Outlaws" is an amusing song and "Country Enough" and "Rainbow Man" both received significant airplay.          
 This is a classic vampire tale.  An innocent school girl discovers that her father has harbored a deep dark secret, in fact several, for years.  His work for a humanitarian institute has been a cover for vampire hunting.  As she begins to get answers about this fantastic revelation she learns of a long standing struggle between good and evil that has been waged for centuries.  A vampire, the infamous Vlad the Impaler, has been recruiting people into his service over the years.  Likely candidates for this 'honor' are contacted by receiving a mysterious book.  Those that are able to seek out its origins are lead on a hunt throughout Europe and Asia on the trail of the elusive Vlad.  Those who choose to struggle against him are punished, those who cease to be useful are discarded.  The story is narrated by a middle-aged woman, a scholar who is telling the story of her life, and the lives of her father and grandfather and their pursuit of the vampire.  The story jumps from the 1970's when she was a teenager, the 1950's when her father was a college student and the 1920's when her father's mentor was a young man.  At times it becomes a bit confusing to try to keep the various threads straight and frustrating when a particular story breaks off at a crucial point.  The suspense is kept at a high level from the opening paragraphs and even though some of the twists are rather obvious most will take the reader by surprise.  This is a definite must read for anyone who is a vampire fan and would also appeal for those who enjoyed THE DaVINCI CODE or similar stories.  I would also recommend buying a copy since this is one that needs repeated readings to get all the details 
 An outstanding book!! Although his underlying assertion is controversial (militant Islam is on its last legs...), Kepel's work is an impressive, and worthwhile, history. The subtitle (The Trail of Political Islam) is a good description of the book's contents, as it doesn't deal with Jihad per se, but it's causes. In it's pages Professor Kepel describes the recent cultural, historical and political circumstances which occasioned the rise of Militant Islam in different geographical areas across the globe. He displays a breadth and depth of knowledge that is amazing. In the book, he details political currents, players, sentiments and events in country after country (Palestine, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Algeria, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, Israel, Jordan, Turkey, to name most). The circumstances he describes are complex, but he evidences a deep understanding of underlying culture, motives, and history. It is a tribute to his skill as a writer that he is able to do this without his book becoming a mere historical catalogue.   In reading these various stories of militancy's birth, certain recurrent themes begin to emerge. For instance, it was interesting to see the phenomenon of `vacuum' as a precursor to the rise of Fundamentalist Islam. That is, in case after case, Kepel details the emergence of political, cultural or religious vacuums - yawning societal chasms which cry out to be filled. Time after time it is Islamism which rushes in to fill that hole. (It seems that `the vacuum' is abhorred by culture as well as nature) Unfortunately, in most cases it seems that Fundamentalist Islam was the only option available at the time.   Also of interest was the sophisticated political savvy with which emerging and established Islamist leaders were able to operate in order to manipulate the populace and maintain power. Some of their shenanigans were all too familiar to me as a Westerner.   As a result of reading this book, my understanding of militancy as a worldview birthed in personal and corporate history, has grown. One caveat, however, is in order: Although well written and basically without rabbit trails or much wasted verbage, the book is not a light read. (Considering the subject matter, that's understandable.) I would say that a certain level of genuine interest on the part of the reader is required in order to effectively engage this presentation. That said, for those who are interested, for those who wish to understand the underlying themes which give rise to Islamic extremism, and gain a better understanding of extremism itself, I highly recommend this book.  
 I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now. This is a "non-fictional" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River.  Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed.  The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river.  The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared. Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such. It is written in typical Mark Twain style - his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face. I really enjoyed this book 
 Going to the beach, then read this book! It is an unexpected story from WW2 and what happened just off the beach (maybe the one you are sitting on while reading this book).  A young woman is surprised with what happens when she leasts expects it and the story is a little known history lesson. The story should have been longer--I wasnt ready for it to end 
 We have several boxes of these Melissa And Doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them!  My three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again!  YES!  My boys love this too!!!  It's a great exercise for their fine motor skills!  The patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful!  It's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace.  I suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time.  Our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words.  **Not suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of candy.  
 Ac/Dc is a band that is truly in a class all itself,they have never changed their style to fit what the flavor of the week is. I really respect that. Every release from Ac/Dc is filled with high energy blues tinged hard rock and roll meant to be played at 10! Highway To Hell the release that followed 'If You Want Blood' is just about perfect,this along with 'Back In Black' is what I would play for people who are just learning about Ac/Dc. It has their absolute best song ever,the title cut 'Highway To Hell',it also has one of their most underrated songs 'Touch Too Much'  Let me explain...this CD is absolutely great from start to finish,if you crank this up to 10 you are experiencing hard rock in it's bare ultimate form,all of today's bands should listen to this and take notes,lots of notes. Angus is playing guitar the way it was meant to be played,where every note is filled with emotion and meaning..and the rhythm section is as tight as can be,without excessive stuff that isn't needed...Ac/Dc never needed to show off to prove how great they were at their instruments...and of course there is Bon...Bon was truly one of the greatest rock and roll singers of all time,because he had a distinct style that many of tried to copy but no one has ever done it like him. In Highway To Hell he perfects the art of rock and roll singing  Highway to Hell-quite simply the best song Ac/Dc ever wrote Girls Got Rhythm - a testimony to the power of women...awesome walk all over you - great rock song about lust ! touch too much - one of their most underrated songs...filled with melody                                                                                                                     and power beating around the bush - great shot down in flames - one of the classics that will be around forever get it hot - great rock song if you want blood - another great one love hungry man - more great music night prowler - one of the most powerful atmosphere rock songs ever...and I love the 'shazzbot nanew nanew' at the end !    The upside - One of the greatest rock albums of all time...produced by Mutt Lange...it is a step by step example of how to create a classic album..  the downside - there is none...you need to get this  the bottom line - This is one of the 2 albums I'd play for anyone just learning about Ac/Dc or rock and roll in general (the other being 'back in black') Run out and buy this...it's classic ..the donutman says so!! 
 From time to time I like to do a search on Amazon for anything by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and when I found Woman in White I was a bit weary. I'm one of those hardcore Phantom of the Opera fans and itr's taken me awhile to shake Phantom off, and find something new to listen too. So, I turned to WOman in White. I bouth off of Amazon, and started listening to it. The whole time I listened I just wanted to keep listening. It had the same affects Phantom had on me. I really love Hope You Like it Here, I Believe My Heart, and A Gift for Living Well. Michael Crawfords great in this musical, and he plays Count Fausco fairly well.  The score amazing, the cast is wonderful, and the musical is one of ALW's best 
 When i first got this book out it didnt sound like a interesting book. I read the first page wondering what was happening. But as the story got deeper into the plot i couldnt put it down. I dont really read that much i enjoy watching television but this was such a sensational read i couldnt stop. Has a nice plot and is writin extremly well. Another great book by David almon 
 My daughter had this book when she was 2 and she LOVED it. Now I'm a home daycare provider and my daycare kids love it. It has a great rythme and funny pictures. I haven't had one child who was scared yet. I have been doing daycare for 3 yrs. 
 The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it 
 Reviewed by Debra Gaynor for Reader Views (10/06)  From the moment I saw the cover of this book I knew that I would find pain within.  The pain of a young man facing the abusive life he's survived.  "Emmy, the events we lived through taught me to be sure of nothing about other people.  They taught me to expect danger around every corner.  They taught me to understand that there are people in this world who mean you harm.  And sometimes they're people who say they love you."  Chillingly Matt recounts the night he sneaked into the kitchen and took an Oreo.  His mother, Nikki, held a knife to his throat and cut him, to teach him to never again steal. This is just one incident in the nightmare he calls childhood.   Matt's father was gone but Matt couldn't blame him, after all he too was terrified of Nikki.   For a while Murdoch seemed to offer some protect from their mother, but, he too found himself unable to cope with the destructive behavior of Nikki.  He cared but was it enough?  Matt knew it was up to him.  He knew he had to find a way to get his two sisters and himself away from, their mother, Nikki, before she destroyed them all.  Matt turned to his father Ben for help, but Ben was too afraid of his former wife to rescue his own children.  This is the story of a brother's attempt to protect his younger sister from their abusive mother. The story is told in the format of letters from Matt to his dear sister, Emmy, trying to explain and warn her about life with their abusive mother.  "As I sit here writing, part of me hopes that you go along happily your whole life and never need or want to know the details."  This book is painful to read.  But it should be read.  There are many children facing the same situation and we, as society, must stop turning our backs on our precious children.  This book is well written.  The type is large enough for tired eyes to easily read it.  The characters are so real that you cry for them.  I found myself wanting to snatch them from their mother's insane antics and give them safety.  I highly recommend "Rules of Survival" for older youth and adults.  
 First I want to say that Travis is one of the best British bands ever, they have become popular in a lot of places and they deserve it. This CD is like the early Travis, when they were more like a "rocker" band, and this isn't bad, but for Travis fans that only know their mellow songs and like them for that type of songs this could be like a dissapoinment, but for me it wasn't.This CD is full of young energy, it has good lyrics and generally good music, but for me it doesn't compares to "The man who" or "The Invisible Band" as a complete CD, but some songs like "Good felling", "more than us" and "I love you anyways" could be even better than some Cds of their next albums. So this is an excelent choice for knowing better Travis. 
 I have read and been a fan of J.D. Robb since I first opened one of her books. Several I have "read" as audiobooks and this one was as geat an experience as the others. The reading of the book was well done and the "voices" excellent. Really adds to your listening enjoyment. One of my favorite ways to take a car trip now is with a Robb audiobook.    
 This is Threat Signal's 2006 debut album "Under Reprisal". This is one of the best new debut albums I've listened to for quite a while, and it's already one of the best albums of 2006 thus far. I bought this album over the weekend, and I was immediately blown away. In a time when heavy music is being dominated by metalcore, it's just so good and refreshing to hear a new band that possess such skill and talent like Threat Signal do. From powerful screams, great melodic/clean singing, to driving syncopated guitar riffs, harmonious leads, ripping solos, to bodyslamming drums, to dynamic musical passages, catchy memorable hooks, "Under Reprisal" definately has everything. Various influences ranging from Soilwork, Meshuggah, Pantera, Fear Factory, Mnemic, Strapping Young Lad, and among others are all present throughout this album as well. Jon Howard is an amazing vocalist who has various styles of vocals, something that As I Lay Dying's vocalist doesn't have. Brutal midrange screams/yells that yet remain clear and understandable, melodic/clean singing that packs alot of punch and emotion, and vicious high throat piercing screams that will make your blood run cold. They also somewhat echo Pantera singer Phil Anselmo at times too. Kyle McKnight is an awesome lead guitarist. His leads and solos on here are absolutely skillful, passionate, and jaw dropping. Rich Howard is an awesome rhythm guitarist as well. He throws down lots of great heavy riffs that are fast, melodic, and technical. On here you also got good bass lines from Marco Bressette that follow Kyle and Rich's twin guitar assault with ease, and you have that awesome slamming double bass drumming from George Parfitt. The opening track "Rational Eyes" is pure bliss. It has punishing guitar riffs, slamming double bass drumming, and an awesome soaring chorus. This is one of my favorite songs on the album, and also the first Threat Signal song I've ever heard. "As I Destruct" another one of my favorite songs, has an awesome jaw dropping solo which is followed by a melodic passage, and a nice piano near the end. My personal favorite on here is track three "One Last Breath". It starts off with a fast riff and the sound of a gunshot going off then soon followed by more fast fiery riffs, fast hammering drums, and a sick throat piercing scream from Jon that will have your blood running cold. There's another great solo too. Other favorite songs on here including "Counterbalance", "Now", "Inane", and "Haunting" keep the album at a ferocious pace with more brutal vocals, driving riffs, ripping solos, and pounding drums. The closing track "When All is Said and Done" starts off with hammering drums, fast driving riffs, brutal shouting vocals which are all followed by a careening solo from Kyle. Then around the 1:47 mark, the song switches to a melodic yet heavy mid tempo tone with some clean singing and some more shouting vocals. Then at the 4 minute mark, the song comes right back with more hammering drums and careening riffs, and a nice melodic solo from Kyle near the end is also present. A great album closer.   The entire song list and the ratings:  1. Rational Eyes - 5/5 2. As I Destruct - 5/5 3. One Last Breath - 5/5 (My favorite song) 4. Seeing Red - 5/5 5. A New Beginning - 5/5 6. Counterbalance - 5/5 7. Inane - 5/5 8. Now - 5/5 9. Faceless - 5/5 10. Haunting - 5/5 11. When All is Said and Done - 5/5  Overall Score: 100/100 Grade: A hard earned A+  Bottom line, if you're a fan of Soilwork, Pantera, Fear Factory, Meshuggah, Mnemic, Strapping Young Lad, etc, you'll definately like Threat Signal. Do yourself a favor, buy this album now. Well Done Nuclear Blast, you have another great new band on your roster.  LONG LIVE THREAT SIGNAL!! STAY METAL! 
 This is Neil Young at his finest.  I held off purchasing at relase beacause I didn't care for Live at Filmore so much.  BIG MISTAKE waiting.  This CD is pure and beautiful.  Everyone should hear these songs again.  I just ordered the DVD so I can see it visually.  Nothing like having Neil in your living room singing from his soul 
 Healy argues that traditional 'blueprint' ecclesiologies fail both church and scholarship through over-rationalization and judgmentalism which fail to help the church live more faithfully.  He offers an interpretation of Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar's 'theo-dramatic' model of divine-human interaction, which contrasts the epic view of life with the (interactive) narrataive view, and uses this insight to develop concepts of church that are, in his view, of better service to the church in issues of inclusivity, pluralism and the 'practical-prophetic'.  The book serves as a good introduction (although this is not its purpose) to the 'radical orthodoxy' movement of Milbank et al, and will be most useful to those seeking to develop their thinking along those lines.  For me (a mainstream protestant), chapters 1 (blueprints) and 7 (practical-prophetic ecclesiology) were most useful, chapters 2 through 6 engaged Roman Catholic scholarship and utilized 'liberalism' as something of a foil.  Healy engages epic academics rather than liberal narrative (there is one), and his vision of what is the faithful church is spelled out with insufficient clarity, indeed, it seems to be presumed.  An engagement with H. Richard Niebuhr's ¨Meaning of Revelation'  and'Radical Monotheism' would broaden his argument, which is more restricted than Healy realizes.  This does not diminish my excitement for the treatise, which certainly is to be added to the 'must read' list in ecclesiology 
 It was so great to watch the live and work of such a genius from the film history !!1 I'm so glad   Mauricio Valde 
 I've loved this book since a Business English class where it was a requirement.  It makes it SO easy to find your topic.  I no longer work in an office, but whenever I have personal correspondence that needs to be "perfect", I find myself still reaching for this little gem 
 This is the most definitive military study of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It vividly records the planning and execution of the war plan, acquaints the reader with the view of military commanders on the ground, and records the battles they fought.  The civilian Pentagon leadership is profiled with a unique (chronological) record of independent advice (eg. troop levels) received from outside sources. Perhaps the best example is Doug Macgregor (sponsored by Newt Gingrich), who thought 5,500 troops could win victory (an additional 15,000 would subsequently be needed to secure peace).  The only rival for this volume is Rick's `Fiasco." Both are well worth reading 
 I'm in 5th grade and we had a Space Camp day and we watched this movie.  I love Space Camp.  It is a great family movie.  After watching Space Camp I want to be an astronaut!!!  I couldn't what to see what was next.  This is a great movie to have in your house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I'm all about poetry. Def Poetry is fabulous, hard core, and real. It's street, romance, politics, and life in spoken word. I am happy to have found this on DVD. I'll buy as many as they make.  
 Mr. Lawhon found the answers to the questions I have been asking.  What is a customer? What is the difference between a successful and less than successful salesperson?  It is  clear that he cares about retail selling and truly is there to help.  This book as well as the selling bible are a must read for everyone in the business of selling no matter what you sell!!!!!!! 
 Trying to pick the best of Dr. John has got to be as hard as trying to classify what type of music he plays. But I have to agree with the decisions on what to put on this disk 
 This dictionary is the best of the Scrabble specific ones that I have.  It gives you specific definitions when checking out words, and gives you different options when trying to make use of a crappy rack!!!! 
 I have beed reading the reviews 4 some time and finally decided to break down and go and buy it. all i cam say is WOW!!!! Thsi is an AWSOME CD. one thing is i didnt know how good AC DC would be live, so i was a little sceptical, but they r just as good, if not better. It isnt like some live CDs where the fans sing half of it, it is an awsome live CD, and would be a great addition to any collection 
 This album is fantastic... 'wandering' may very well be the most beautiful song ever created... you've got to put it up there with 'yesterday'... the album tracks beautifully and there's the wonderful songwriting that puts JT right up there with the Beatles. It's hard for me to describe this album too much to anyone.. the thing I respect the most about James Taylor is that you feel he wrote from his heart almost all the time.. and that you felt he really loved the music he was creating... the production on this album is brilliant.. these songs may have 70s synth but they're tastefully used... Stevie Wonder style!!!! You feel like JT is really the white Stevie Wonder.. introspective lyrics mixed in with tons of higher tertian circle of 5ths harmonic progression makes this simply one of the greatest of JTs albums and is in my top 10 all time 
 If you love Food you will love Ruth Reichl!  This was one of her most creative and insider looks at being a food critic.  And everyone should meet Molly!  
 I first saw this movie when it aired on tv way back in 1987 when I was eleven.  It is still one of my (as well as my sister and a few friends') favorite movies.  I have never read the book, and was not aware that they changed the plot just a bit, until I read the other reviewers comments.  I have never seen any of the other film versions and don't plan on it, since this one is perfect.   The story is about a spoiled yet negelected girl named Mary who goes to live with her father's old aquaintance in England after her folks die in a flu epidemic in India.  She at first hates her new home because it is so huge and dark. Also it is filled with sounds of moaning, which at first she thinks is a ghost.  She finally begins to take an interest in life after meeting her sweet maid Martha.  Martha introduces her to her brother Dicken and they eventually find a secret garden. Dicken teaches her how to love people and God's creation, and she becomes likable.  She eventually meets Colin, the invalid boy who stays in his room who has also dealt with loneliness and neglect like Mary.  They become friends with Dicken who continues to teach them about hope.  For fans of Colin Firth, you will be thrilled to know he plays the grown up Colin at the end of the film.  He is young and HOT!    I challenge those of you who have not seen this film to try to get through it with atleast shedding one tear.  It is truly touching without being overly sappy. 
 IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does. 
 I got my first copy of Owl in Love in '95 when I was 14. As a new kid in a new town that year I thuroughly identified with the alienation the main character went through.  When my mother found me reading it, however, and discovered it was "about a girl who eats mice", she threw it away and pretended it had gotten lost in the unpacking.  Years later when I was in college I was working at a Barnes & Noble and ordered myself a new copy so I could enjoy the story again.  I'm so glad I did, it remains one of my favorites 
 What stands out about this Think Big, Act Small is that the ten companies the author highlights are not only model organizations and true to their mission, they also have the benefit of outstanding leadership.  What struck me, especially in light of the culture of the rock star CEO is that for the most part, those who lead these organizations wants no part of that star mystique.  Instead, they are interested in building organizations that stay true to their employees, their partners, and ultimately, to their customers.  KnightofGod spoke about some of the common sense lessons, that surprisingly enough are not as common place as you would think.  I think that's the crux of how these companies operate.  They adopt a common sense approach to their business, placing little bets along the way, quietly go about building their reputation, and where I think most companies truly fall short, give their employees a sense of ownership, either emotionally or by giving them a piece of the company.  For the CEO's that think a part of their job is to be on CNBC, it certainly is refreshing to read about executives who to a certain extent shun the spotlight.  Not only are they averse to being on stage, they also shun the trappings of CEO-life.  It is in stark contrast to the stories we have all read about.  Jenning's lays out ten "Building Blocks" to think big, but act small.  In each of his ten cases, to one degree or another, these building blocks were a cornerstone or some component to their success.  He also provides the reader with an evaluation to determine where their companies fall in a "The Quad," or the four types of companies (TSAS, TSAB, TBAB, TBAS - See Robet Morris' excellent review for further details).    Ultimately, Think Big, Act Small, is a great book on how ten companies did things their own way, shunning the advice of investment bankers and the demands of wall street.  In most cases it gave each company the liberty to do what they thought was best for them, their partners and their companies.  And in each case, the beneficiary has been the client.  I highly recommend Think Big, Act Small.  If you are a commuter like me, reading this book is time well spent as you wait for your stop 
 "'Category Five' packs all of the punch of a full force hurricane. This Mach One thriller deftly pulls the reader to the edge of disaster with heartrending skill . . . Philip Donlay is to aircraft what Tom Clancy is to submarines. If you love the old-style Clancy, you won't put Donlay down."---Kathleen Antrim, Author of No. 1 Best Seller "Capital Offense"   
 It seems this is a deck you either love or hate. I love it and although some view it as pessimistic, I find it a realistic portrayal of good and evil. It's not a cute deck but the art and colours are striking 
 I highly recommend this book because it was very easy to read and was incredibly helpful for a beginning pilates student!  I've begun taking classes and this book is an invaluable tool for successfull pilates practice 
 The author Davies has done a superior job in detailing all of the aspects of frozen shoulder pain and resolution. Your shoulder doesn't have to be fully 'frozen' to benefit highly from this text 
 Collingwood's definition of what art is the best I know. I am so fond of this book that when I couldn't find my hardbound copy I bought a paperbouond one to tide me over. 
 I enjoyed this book which was full of Sam's personality! The quotes are wonderful, so I added a lot to my collection. The "blockers and builders" give you a plan and are true-to-life. Usually I keep my reading list private, but I'm recommending this book to the rest of my family. I even contacted Sam about including some of the activities in my newsletter and she kindly gave permission. Her other books are next on my reading list 
 I opened this book with the wild hope that is could actually help me out of the black hole that fear had trapped me in.  What I found was exactly what I needed.  I found my life accurately yet sensitively described in the pages of the chapter on anxiety.  The authors make clear the relationship between the mind and the body and how they affect each other, clarifying for me why I suffered mentally and physically the way I did.  They go on to show the reader how they can finally be free of such agony.  The authors are careful to exhort biblically, using God's word to confront, correct, and heal.    I found the earlier chapters most helpful for my own struggles.  The later chapters will be helpful if I ever find myself in any of the physical conditions which they address, or if I am in a position to counsel someone else in such a condition.    It's no easy thing to battle depression, anxiety, or other such emotions, and the authors never present it that way.  They clearly understand the pain and the struggle, and they are loving and gentle in their approach.  I highly recommend this book to both women and men who struggle this way.  I have purchased several copies already and am giving them out to people as I have opportunity.   
 I love Robert Frost's poetry and was looking for a good way to introduce his wonderful words to young children.  I have found that way through this beautiful book.  I am an assistant principal and can't wait to share this  book with my teachers and students.  As I read this book, I felt like I was  in New England during all four seasons.  A must buy for poetry lovers and  Robert Frost fans 
 Journalism has deteriorated to the point where one is supposed to "balance" the truth with lies, and pretend both have equal weight.  The case against GMO's is damning, as is the case against Monsanto, and this book presents both with forthrightness and clarity. "Balancing" this information with industry propaganda is both ridiculous and unnecessary -- the industry ensures that most pieces written about it are written by cheerleaders.  Genetic engineering is a woefully imprecise "science," and the UNwanted effects of inserting a gene from one species into another's genome -- with no idea of where the gene ends up or how many copies of it have been inserted -- can be quite harmful.  This book is well worth reading 
 I have been practicing Magic for a little over a decade. Of course this has been mainly from that given in Golden Dawn books and others that really are in the same vein. I thought about evocation more than a few times but always felt very uneasy inside. As if there was something chewing away at my mind that told me the books of today that I read just didn't teach it the way it should be done. Maybe I'm too cautious, but I have been burned and burned badly from a number of rituals that I did not perform correctly, and so my caution was well justified as I see it. Then I saw this book and decided to give it a try. What I found in it proved to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that my caution was and is well founded. Evocation is a very dangerous business as this writer points out. And to offset this he takes a MORE than firm stand as to the nature of these magical beings, just HOW they are to be evoked, and offers NO apologies to all those others who would have you believe evocation is just some mental process used to get an internal copy of a spirit to appear in a circle. He is ruthless on the New Age people and frankly after I thought it over, I have to agree with him. These people talk so much, have so little in their lives it's pathetic (I know scads of them) and still do next to nothing and then yell when someone steps up and says THIS is how to do it whether you like it or not. His writing is very clear, DIRECT to say the least, and extremely sharp and detailed. He leaves nothing to chance or to guessing. It's all here.   Some reviewers here complained this author is a dictator in his views. But I guess those that can teach, and those who can't complain. For me, he is what Magic needs: someone who doesn't "chew his tobacco twice" as the old saying goes. I am delighted with this book (and his other two that I also bought) and have begun my own movement toward this practice. Others who have had enough of being lied to, talked down to or bamboozled by 10 cent writers writing 20.00 books should get and use this book. It is a breath of fresh air in the stagnant swamp that has become the New Age.    
 Even though I had believed that I knew at least a bit about all aspects of the American Revolution, this book caught me by surprise. I had never known anything about the British and their freedom offer to the slaves of American rebels. This exciting story spends a bit of time on the war itself and the rush to liberty of multitudes of blacks, but the bulk of it is taken up with what happened to the freed slaves when the war was over. There we see that the British government wasn't very much different from the American one, in that it professed its belief in liberty for all, but in practice the ex-slaves were considered second-class citizens, if even that. They were unceremoniuosly dumped into squalor in Nova Scotia, and only the efforts of a few brave Englishmen allowed many of them to be transported to Sierra Leone, there to found a free black society. Even there the people were subjected to being demeaned by the whites who controlled the area. This is a sad morality tale, and it shows up the hypocracy of both the American and British systems of government. This should be required reading for everyone 
 I have no concerns with the product and am happy with what I've paid for.

 You may have seen the movie like I did, you may have seen Damn Yankees performed in summer stock theater like I did, but the original Broadway cast recording is outstanding.  I used to listen to it a lot since my father had the album and introduced me and my siblings to musicals in the 50's.  The songs and artists were better than I remembered from the LP.  If you like the old classic musicals, you'll love this CD.  I don't mind at all that it isn't in stereo-it's just wonderful the way it is.  I have since ordered the movie from Amazon!!!  Just the title alone will entice any Red Sox fan like me--too bad the Washington Senators were the subject team and not the Sox 
 Studies of the prophetic literature of the old testament are quite a few.  But not too many of them are really that good.  This one is an exception.  Though not a perfect study of course, it is a very useful tool in studying the old testament prophetic literature.  Does a good job of locating the prophets and their writings/themes in the proper historical context all the while also placing the prophets within the wider scope of biblical revelation.  Covers all the "major" and "minor" prophetic books of the old testament.  Goes through each book more or less section by section helping one to grasp the flow of the prophet's concerns and content.  Fleshes out the contribution of each prophet's message in light of the overarching plan of redemption in the bible as a whole, spanning from the old testament and into the new testament.  The author is a christian old testament professor 
 And I LOVE R.E.M. With "Document" REM produced back to back classics. "Life's Rich Pagent" was one of the greatest albums ever. "Document" is the beginning of REM becoming more mainstream and more political, with songs such as 'Exhuming McCarthy' and 'Welcome to the Occupation' 'Disturbance at the Herron House' REM speaks on the injustices and outrages they see within both the government and the American people. With the popularity of the song "The End of the world" REM garnered much radio play, the benefit of which is oft debated by REM diehards. Did popularity and radio play ruin one of the greatest bands ever?? Unfortunately, I believe it did. Mainstreaming ones music is NEVER beneficial (except to the bands bank accounts). 'Document" I believe is the last truly great REM album. Every song on here is great, and the production is FLAWLESS. As on "Life's Rich Pagent" lead singer Michael Stipes voice comes throug loud and clear, perhaps even better on "Document" than on "Pagent". No longer is he drowned out by the bass guitar or the drums. Apparently he has decided that yes, he really DOES have something important to say and that we the listener should be able to decipher these little jewels of wisdom. This was my favorite album for about 3 years. With the release of "Green" REM became too popular for me and I felt the quality of their music suffered, radio uber-friendly 'Stand' being a perfect example of this. They even released a really bad "pop" like video. I wanted to vomit. REM videos up to this point were rare (I had to actually purchase a VHS !! tape of them and watch it repeatedly. The name of this tape slips my mind, and it was purchsed back in 1988 or so). If you're a new fan trying to get into REM, I really recommend you buy "Life's Rich Pagent" and "Document" and then work your way around their vast collection from there.  This is a really great piece of work.  
 You got questions, it has answers. You want to dive into the world of audio production, this book shows you the door and gives you the key. Very very instructiv 
 Great purchase. Very fast shipping! 
 I had a wonderful experience buying this fabulous book from Amazon. It arrived as promised and is definately the best book geared towards women for running. I have looked at a couple other books like this and they didn't even compare 
 We bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1! My hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it. By the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it, gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages. Needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd Birthday.(He just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off) His sister is now  nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps. Dont just think about it , buy it. And the sooner the better. Other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one. And forget the versions with brakes, the kids should only go as fast as they can handle 
 I'm so happy to see Ellen in a movie. All in all, the movie is full of romance and laughter. The all around cast is great to watch 
 This book is a must have because it covers all the information and rituals in great detail as if you where in a real class talking to a real teacher  
 This is a powerful book for those that want to understand more about their spirituality.  We focus a lot on understanding religion but we do not take enough time to understand our relationship with God.  Chasing God opens up a whole new understanding about God and God's love, reaching out toward us.  We often hear the phrase, if you want to change the world change yourself...well this book is a step in the right direction.  I read the book in one day, I could not put it down 
 The book is a bit of a tough read during the first half, which discusses the Knights Templar.  Great info, but a challenge to read without wanting to skip a page or two every now and then.  The second half regarding the Freemansons is very interesting and eye opening.  I would by the book alone for the Fremason section 
 The monkey in this case is in reference to the phrase, "getting the monkey off your back." A monkey is a work unit that needs to be done, and the manager in question is someone who takes on the monkeys of his underlings. Instead of delegating the responsibility to people under him, he does the job. The consequence is that he is putting in a full day on Saturday while his underlings are out playing golf. Finally fed up with this situation, he decides to truly take charge and keep the monkeys where they belong.  The question then passes from the what to do to the how to do it and that is the point of the book. The harried manager attends a seminar and learns how inefficient it is to avoid the delegation of authority. It also takes a change in ego and attitude to do it. We all want to feel needed, so it is necessary to overcome the feelings of personal indispensability before the delegation can occur. Written by the author of the classic. "The One Minute Manager", this is another book that is indispensable to the manager who is overworked due to an unwillingness to take the risk of letting others do what is their work. 
   If find this to be a good quick reference to terminology.  I would recommend this as a basic overview of medical terminology. 
 Orwell's DOWN & OUT is an amazing book--witty, finely observed, unsentimental, and utterly absorbing. Reminds me of Jack London's PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS, which was a journalistic foray into London's slums circa 1903--about 20 or 25 years before Orwell gave his account of what it was like to be destitute, despised, dirty, and lowdown in Paris and London in the years after WWI. A brilliant, haunting book.. 
 In search of a challenging read, and intrigued by the Italian locale of much of the story, I picked up this 500+ page book at the library one day during lunch.  Styron's vocabulary is immense, and his prose is quite enjoyable to read.  The 1st part of the book is pretty absorbing, but the middle part is so slow and drawn out that it makes getting to the fairly interesting end rather tedious.  The main problem I had was the inordinate focus on Cass' recollections.  His recollections of North Carolina and the South I liked, but Cass' actions are not particulary considerate towards his family, and he is not an especially sympathetic character (esp. given his own self-destructive tendencies).  I did not view Mason as some kind of evil incarnate, and ultimately the character of Leverett is not developed and fades into the background.  Finally, given the book came out in 1960, some of the cultural differences and clashes brought out in the book (e.g. Mason talking about the Beats) seem a little dated.  Nevertheless, the European setting and exquisite writing style compelled me to see the book to its (largely satisfactory) ending.  If you have the time, and patience, this book may well be worth your while 
     This short novel is existentialism at its best. Life is meaningless and daily events are trivial. This point is emphasized through the main character, Meursault, and his lack of vivacity and dispassionate manner. His reaction towards the death of his mother is summed up with the indifferent statement of "Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe..." As incomprehensible as his response is, as a reader, I found myself sympathizing and relating to this emotionally isolated man.       The Stanger, though not a happy book, is a an insightful and interesting read. Recognizing unfortunate similarities between yourself and the character of Meursault is bound to take place (such as the need to observe surrounding human tendencies, or the need to guard yourself against disappointment). Though you will not be able to fully embrace the character Meursault, you cannot help but feel that his outlook on life makes perfect sense.           Albert Camus excels at using the various characters within The Stanger to represent allegories of life. With old Salamano and his dog, one witnesses the power of daily routine and the resistance to change. Camus' writing style is to the point and easy to read. I enjoyed the existential theme and loved attempting to dissect the complex character of Meursault.  
   Fat!So? is a book that should be required reading, both because it promotes good body image and health and because it fights fat oppression.  Marilyn doesn't let people get away with making incorrect assumptions about what fat people eat and how active we are.  She doesn't let people get away with unfair and untrue stereotypes.  With great humor, occasional righteous anger, and always with articulate brilliance, she is part of what amounts to a Civil Rights movement for fat people.      This book is not only for the fat -- it is for everyone who has ever worried about their weight, everyone who has ever judged themselves or another for their weight, and everyone who is exposed to the constant media bashing (and the false medical claims) against fatness.  Question: if we are getting fatter as a nation and our longevity is rising, how are we coming to the conclusion that fat kills?  Question: if people who are married live longer and people who are married also are known to gain weight, where is the assumption coming from that fat is unhealthy?  For more on fat and health, I strongly recommend The Obesity Myth by Paul Campos and Big Fat Lies by Glenn Gaesser.   I imagine the "health" debate will go on -- but health concerns aside, the oppression and mistreatment of fat people is NOT acceptable.  Fat!So? is a book for anyone who wants to live a sane and full life.  This book is for any woman who is afraid to be seen in a bathing suit.  This book is for everyone.   Now all we need is a Fat!So? II because I'm READY to read more from Marilyn.     
 its a good looking suit. i ware a small in all things . but not this it should have been a m. think of getting a size biger than what you war 
 This book starts off with a very good description of what this book is all about: John and Jane both gross $50,000 a year. John gets $40,000 after taxes, Jane gets $45,000. The difference - John works for someone and goes into work. Jane works at home and gets to deduct her home office expenses.   The IRS allows you to deduct your expenses of maintaining a home office. At the same time, the IRS rules are fairly comples, and home office expenses are often overstated or subject to outright fraud. So the IRS tends to look at them fairly carefully, they have been known to come to your house to see what your office looks like.   This book, updated to be current for 2006, explains the rules as written down, the rules as actually followed and gives you some tips as to what you should, shouldn't, must, and mustn't do. Beyond the official rules, which are messy enough, there are more or less unknown rules, i.e. computer software that you buy is written off one way (well actually two or three ways), software you create, either for yourself or for sale, is handled quite differently.   This book is well written, simple to read and up to date with current law 
 This works fine - got it in the time promised.  The only difficulty is that there is not much of an instruction manual 
 Buchanan has done a remarkable job of bringing to life the key Revoluntionary War characters and events of 1780-81 in the Carolinas.  His masterful interpretation of personalities and their motives provides insight into the critical battles of the southern war.  He moves back and forth between the major antagonists on both sides to develop the background for understanding the brilliance of the rebel strategy and the British arrogance that lead to their eventual loss in the south.  Not only do we learn about famous personalities such as Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan, Nathanael Greene, Lord Cornwallis and Banastre Tarleton, but we gain an understanding of the anonymous mortals without whom the Revolution would have been lost:  the individual militia men from the back country of the Carolinas.  Buchanan has an uncanny ability to explain in simple language the complexities of the troop placement and individual unit actions that occurred in the various battles.  However, his book would be immensely improved if he had provided maps of the region and of the battlegrounds he described.  Like many biographers, Buchanan grows to have an attachment (or detachment) for the people he has so painstakingly researched, which I find of great interest.  One must be aware of some of the potential bias that might creep in with any biographical interpretation, including his.   I recently finished biographies on Daniel Morgan and Nathanael Greene, yet discovered new information about each man in Buchanan's exposition.  A very thorough job, indeed.  One caveat:  one should probably have read somewhat extensively regarding the Revolution to fully enjoy and understand Buchanan's book.  He occasionally assumes some prior knowledfge of events and people 
 I used to think "The Soul of a New Machine" by Tracy Kidder was  unsurpassable in this genre. But the truth is, "The Eight Day of  Creation" is far more ambitious, far more informative, far more  amazing, and far more important. And it's also very beautifully written.  What a great way for people to find out what the deepest truths are in  biology, and how they were discovered 
 'Space Station 7th Grade' is a great, funny, and enertaining book. My son is in the seventh grade and reading this book was like reading a real life story of a kid new to middle school.   I really enjoyed the part of the book when Jason first had to take a shower after PE. Students having to run around in a huge shower room together naked as jay birds is many elementary kids 'worst nightmare'. My son's PE teacher has really good pointers, www bganssle com tsshowers html, for parents and kids who share this worry. Kids who feel awkward about their first showers at school, trust me and be like Jason in the book and give it a try. Soon any discomfort will pass.   Do you have a son or daughter about to start middle school? Have them read Space Station 7th Grade. My son had to learn many new things when starting middle school, the book was a like a guide book to prepare him 
 This book has excellent recipes for a wide range of soups and stews.  There is a small reference section in the back which is helpful.  As with all books in the series, the photography is gorgeous and the recipes are easy to follow 
 I purchased this soundtrack because I really enjoyed this music while watching the movie. But I was a little disappointed at the CD. Some soundtracks allow you to follow the entire plot like through the music (such as the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack). But this CD doesn't provide that. Several of the songs are recurring in the film but are only played once in the soundtrack. I would have liked the soundtrack to reflect the music for the whole film rather than just excerpts.  I give the music 5 stars and the CD 2-1/2 stars 
 There I was waiting shaving my legs and the water in the tub was draining away when suddenly I looked down and noticed all these little glittery confetti hearts. So cute! That was a nice surprise and I didn't see them while I was taking a bath. I did see the little candy flowers floating about.   This bath has a high "cuteness" factor and if you are in one of those "everything has to be pink" moods, then Think Pink may suit your candy mood. Lavender oil, Tonka absolute, vanilla and neroli oil makes this a calming bath that leaves you a little happier. You may enjoy this bath even more with the calming sweet "Honey I Washed the Kids Sweet Honey Soap" or the "Sultana of Soap" bar which is sumptuously smooth and leaves a fragrance on your skin that lasts all night.   If you want a pink/vanilla soap, then you may want "Rock Star." If you are into mixing and matching according to scents, then the Trichomania is mildly scented with coconut and looks like a vanilla shampoo bar and it goes well with the vanilla scented American Cream conditioner.   I vote for a tad more vanilla, although you can toss a little vanilla oil in the bath or some vanilla from the kitchen also works well. Eating sugar cookies in the tub is optional.   ~The Rebecca Review  
 I am so impressed with this collection of songs, I don't know where to start this review!? For those who love Green Gartside and his very special mix of pop, soul, funk and Art Song, this album will not disappoint at all. For the rest of the philistines of the world, raised on MTV and Coldplay, this album will be inexplicable, confusing and strange.     Here we are again, sadly, far too rarely!, with Mr. Green Gartside, his beautiful 'haute-contre' voice and collection of wise, witty and wonderful songs. Scritti Politti is a very precious thing in this world.    Wotz it like?  Well, sort of like David Cassidy and De Barges mixed with Robert Schumann and Nico. Yes, that is really what it is like! ;-))    Thank God!    Love ya, Green.     On ya, Green.  
 Ok 1st off I never liked sony to begin with but after I got this receiver my whole perspective changed this thing has power and accuracy exactly where its needed. The bass isnt muddy its clear and deep, the mids and highs are powered up, Im running a 12 inch 200 watt sub with 4 tower speakers that have 200 watt range and a 125 watt center channel they all hit hard when I crank it. I love movies so this is great for sorround movies as well as for video games, music, radio, and tv. The best feature I'd have 2 say is the auto calibration system with the microphone, it definately is a big plus in my book. The setup on the back for connecting wires could've been alot better but still if your not electronicaly illiterate then you should'nt have a problem 
 The book I read was The Childern of Noisy Village.This book is about a group of young childern. They do different things every day. One of the girls in the book tells about some things in her life and other people. The childern play and have a good imagination. Astrid Lindgern takes us through the year of six Swedish childern living in a row of three houses North Farm, Middle Farm, and South Farm. Many differnt surprises come through this book. This book I recommend to children and adults. This is a book for people that realy want to hear a child's point of view, and that loves to hear about the country of Sweden 
 For people who are trying to make sense of their bisexual drives, or for people who are trying to be considerate of people they love who have bisexual drives, this book provides considerate feedback.  I really appreciated the work that went into gathering the data for this book. The authors genuinely cared about the ethical, health, and life-affecting characteristics of bisexual behavior. The authors didn't just "mail it in". They moved in to the Bisexual Center in San Francisco, engendered the trust of the bi-sexual survey respondents and asked many significant questions.  The book sets out to "show that sexual preference is a more complex, fluid, and emergent outcome than today's biological determinism dictates." They note that Kinsey reported that the direction of a person's sexual attraction or behavior does not necessarily remain stable: a considerable number of people change the heterosexual and homosexual mix in their sexuality during their lives." The authors' data & interviews appear to support that finding. The book uses "the term 'sexual preference' to emphasize that people take an active part in construcitng their sexuality, as opposed to 'sexual orientation', which suggest that sexual preference is established at birth or fixed thereafter."  The book is about 300 pages long, but there are about 150 additional pages of notes, citations, and table data. Browsing through the easy to read tables, showing the bi-sexual respondents answers to relationship questions, is fascinating. An easy critique of that data is the statistical sampling is way too small - but something is better than nothing.   The book also seems to imply that the AIDS crisis strongly changed bisexuals' behavior - making this reviewer wonder if bisexuality may have become a larger trend, but for the AIDS virus.  The book does not wax positive on bisexuality. I don't think people who read this book will walk away thinking: that sounds interesting & fun. Rather, as the book states "Bi-sexuals found it impossible to make sense of their sexuality by adopting either a heterosexual or homeosexual identity." 
 Thanks for keeping a Brit sane in a country full of "My wife says..." jokes.  Your wife is fat and ugly and I don't care what she says. Because she's ugly. And fat...  ..and not my wife 
 This book fills a huge hole in civil rights history literature. Anyone involved in that struggle and other similiar type movements know the huge amount of grunt work that goes into a simple picket line.  This work that the men scorned was the backbone of the movement and continues to this day.    It shines a light on influential women in civil rights and goes into a their history and struggles. Many of these women have been mentioned in other books but that is all that is done - barely mentioned.  In addition, Ms. Olson explores in an extremely honest way the relations between white women and black women and black men.  These pages were some of the best writing I ever read on this topic 
 "Logic Made Easy"   by Deborah J. Bennett      A peculiar shortcoming of rationalism,  is that it is no better than the people who practice it.  There are those who claim to be rationalists, and who pride themselves, thinking that they are embodiments of logic, but who still embrace flawed propositions.   Why?  The method may be a perfect science,  but those who  practice the method may operate with errors,  bias,  and ulterior motives.   This is why books like "LOGIC MADE EASY" can help us.      There is other generalized information that I wish to communicate to you.  From an early age,  I have been fascinated by matters of LOGIC.   Learn from me,  so that you do not enter into discouragement. I have taken up and failed at studying LOGIC many times.  Allow me to tell you why.  It is because in normal day to day activities,  our minds  do not function  in the Logical manner suggested by the books.   Why is that?  How does our Mind operate?   Only formal efforts produce book-like syllogisms.  Life itself,  operates on the principle of a hidden syllogism.   We have the conclusion of logic,  without the syllogism being made explicit, or objectively clear.       Pause and think for a moment.  The Greeks postulated CHAOS. Even now,  from the swirling CHAOS around us,  Life itself has no stated propositions,  empirically observable.  Physical matter itself does not speak to us. It offers only silence.  From that silence,  our mind must operate selectively,  choosing Primary Assumptions,  and from this will follow logical corrollaries, or extensions by logic. This is why the book of life is readeable.      It is for us to discover the Hidden Syllogisms.  There are more obscure obstacles.    The authors of books on formal logic almost never write about the fundamental duality of life;  that only part of life is Objective.  That the greater manifestation of life is entirely Subjective.       Then there are the myths that logic ought to make us into some kind of perfectly logical automaton,  like a robot.  I'm sorry,  but that is silly.  One of the shortcomings of Logic books is that they almost never clarify the Subjective side of Life,  and the relationship between the Objective and the Subjective.  That is why we have books by some,  proclaiming themselves to be "rationalists" (and scientists),  that they have proven the NON-EXISTENCE of the Super-Subjective,  otherwise known as "God".   Worse still is the implication that sometimes creeps into writings by  "rationalists"  who infer that pure rationalism prohibits  belief or faith in our spiritual life.         Moreover,   the role of FEELINGS are also left unclear.  Logic books are their own worst enemy.  When people find that they have FEELINGS,  and operate in a world where logic is all very fine and nice,  but POWER is the rule of the day,  they become very discouraged with the idea that Logic is of any real use.  "What's the point?" they demand,  and angrily toss aside the books on Logic.  Logic books rarely clarify the role of subjective principles such as  Power, Feeling,  Intuition, and the like.  Losing a student in this manner is the fault of the expert teacher, not the fault of the student,  who will wrongfully conclude that he or she is "stupid".       I rate this 5 stars, but I do not agree with the cover language that this is:     "The best and the most lucid introduction to logic you will find." --Martin Gardner (from the book cover)       Much struggle with complex ideas has taught me that we often do better to start simple and work up to the more definitive lessons.  I have reviewed 2 other INTRODUCTIONS to logic in the past few months.  Both are simpler,  but I must make the observation that "LOGIC MADE  EASY" is more thorough,  more complete,   including SET THEORY and SYMBOLIC LOGIC  and LME is profoundly rich in historical background material.  For those of us  who are fascinated by What Aristotle learned from Plato concerning Logic,  this is  of interest.  Credit Deborah J. Bennett for including this historial material. It shows good scholarship.       Allow me to clarify some of these remarks,  lest the reader think that my review is intended to suggest that you PREFER one book to the exclusion of others.  I recommend buying several books.   If you see three book reviews,  rating all 5 Stars,  I mean to say that you should buy all three, not just one.  These must be studied patiently.  The goal is Truth, and the great difficulty in Life,  is that Truth requires work,  always,  whereas Lies are quick and easy.  The student of Truth must literally sacrifice himself and his opinions to reach the Truth.  This is the reason why not everyone claiming to be a "scientist"  or a "rationalist" is an Einstein, or a Faraday.     Our inclinations may lead us in one direction,  whereas the logic of basic facts tend to go in the other.   Let me remind with a serious WARNING also,  that there is much published in books today by authors who are very biased,  who have no regard for facts,  whose popular literature on hot issues of public debate is rife with logical and philosophical error.  Logic has nothing to do with "shouting louder" than the other fellow.  In fact,  C.G. Jung liked to point out that when argumentation passes a particular point in emotionality,  it no longer is rationally useful.  Truly,  men can function as beasts at times, losing sight of their heritage.             
 This presentation of Pride and Prejudice is lovely yet realistic.  I love the attention to details, like the dishes on the table (shown as would appear naturally, not perfectly set), the lighting in the ballroom (candlelight), the gowns (not perfectly pressed).  Keira Knightly is a wonderful Elizabeth - witty, observant, happy and beautiful.  The countryside is unspoilt.  The story is represented much as the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, but with tweaks in the screenplay.  I found the difference in words refreshing and it is a fresh view of an old favorite.  I recommend this version heartily.  I love all versions of Pride and Prejudice but this is really, really nice 
 I couldn't think up a better way to protect kids clothes than with this apron! The long sleeves are a great feature. It also seems to fit a wide range of toddlers and young children. I love the little pockets for supplies and whatnot. Also, it wipes clean quite easily! This apron is a winner in my book 
 This film is an excellent entry into the Hellraiser series.The entry of Pinhead, is so classic, and the final  denoument is just superb. But , as good as this film is, don't thank the Director, Rick Bota , for the positives in this film. He was handed the script, he was given notes by Clive Barker himself after a review of the semi-final  cut, and he threw out some of the best  scenes and kept them only as a deleted scenes set. This film succeeds in spite of the Director. The power of Ashley Lawrence as an actress is shown again in the film series. Compare this film with HELLRAISER DEADER... it is evident that Bota cannot do a Hellraiser film without Connect the dot instructions. He may be a good Cinematographer ( and in Deader, Bota had the benefit of one of the local cinematic  Masters who made sure that Bota's work at least LOOKS  good), and if Bota filmed DEMON KNIGHT, then kudos to him, since I love the film... but he fails in Deader, and this one succeeds because he had so many other masterful  craftsmen that he could not help but produce a decent product. Doug Bradley appears as at least two characters in this film, and once again you get to see how powerful he is as an actor, and how immortal he is as PINHEAD. I hope Bota is kept well away from HELLRAISER films  in the future 
  This is one of the few books that humble me when I contemplate it. Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any "newly rediscovered" esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _The Secret Docrine_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too "quaint" and "old-fashion" for the "New Age."   There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply "browse." I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.   One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.    Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as  the "seven races" and "seven globes", just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of "seven heavens." Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity 
 Yo-Yo Ma went beyond indeed. The first CD with Silk Road ensemble (When Strangers Meet) was inconsistent and somewhat experimental. This one however, is superb. As if in the 5 years the musicians got to know each other (but in truth, only a few musicians are the same). 23 traditional Eastern instruments are listed plus a number of western strings and other percussion was used. So the music on this CD gets my full attention, and as the title of first track suggests, you (can) get enchanted.  The tracks are ordered into three parts: Enchantments (1-5), Origins (6-9) and New Beginnings.  First track is strangely familiar (like it was used in some film, but there is no mention of this). In third track this theme gets Chinese interpretation. The style from one track to the other changes, so you can't get bored or overexcited. Second is simply very nice, the fourth great intro of Armenian wind instrument duduk (played by famous Gevorg Dabaghyan), accompanied by percussion mostly, albeit the piece is short. 5 is gentle with cello and xun (Chinese ocarina), 6 orchestral from slow to cool, 7 again gentle with cello and vocal, 8 starts with yearning duduk and turns into orchestral battle, 9 cello and percussion. Track 10 is the only one with prominent vocal (love song) and introduces us to the last part of CD, which are more like jam sessions of all instruments. 11 and 13 are very lively. The last one, track 15, brings us a new interpretation of very ancient Chinese melody played on pipa.   Some would probably say this CD is commercialized. Personally I don't see any wrongdoings in this as long the music stays a high quality one. For the more authentic Silk Road one can always buy The Silk Road: A Musical Caravan. 
 This is a mini preview of a parenting method that is amazing.  Love and Logic WORKS!!  It does not matter the age of the child or behavior of the child...ADHD, to sweet angel.  I have used this parenting method on my 10 month old and it works.  My sister-in-law introduced me to Love & Logic before I was even a parent to start preparing.  I read this book over and over again, along with the many other resources Love & Logic provides.  Look up the other books and get them, it will be worth every penny...it will be priceless knowledge! 
 _Dream Work_ is the first Mary Oliver book that I found, way back in 1989  while ill with pneumonia. "The Journey", possibly Mary's most  popular poem, leapt out at me and quite literally opened my mind to a  deeper commitment to self-care.  That poem was Good Medicine!! ...  "Wild Geese" has been another balm; who among us couldn't feel  more tender towards ourselves when we read these lines, "You do not  have to be good./You do not have to walk on your knees/for a hunded miles  through the desert, repenting./You only have to let the soft animal of your  body/love what it loves." 
 A great book, reasonably priced and filled with thought provoking exercises that really help you dig deep to find what it is you really love to do.  I've recommended this book to several friends and they have all commented on how pleased they were with the book and the results they achieved by "doing the work" 
 This is one of the finast works I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.It covers a almost forgotten period of our nation's history when young men were actually inspired to fight for the honor of a nation and it's culture. The primacy of male emotions,another much ignored literary topic,is on view in every chapter. There is action,chvalry,war ,peace,love and revenge. This is one that is better than the movie and almost impossible to put down 
 Gabaldon never lets her tale lag, and even though extraordinary things happen in the tale, they never seem outlandish. The story is gripping. Highly recommended. 
 Wouldn't it be great if there existed in this world a singular person or entity who had all the answers to your questions regarding health, nutrition, and weight loss? This person would know exactly what to say about your specific circumstance and present the information to you in such a way that you felt good about yourself and honestly believed you could make the necessary changes in your life with little pain. For the millions of overweight and obese, that would be a miracle.  Well, I hope you believe in miracles because such a person DOES exist. Her name is Our Lady of Weight Loss and she spoke to a woman named Janice Taylor at a weight loss clinic of all places in 2001. From that day forward, Janice saw a change in her life like she had never experienced on any diet she had ever been on and completely turned her life around.  Does all this pseudo-religious talk sound a little spooky to you? LOL! Yeah, it did me, too. That is, until I kept reading and found out how these principles are what helped Janice Taylor shed 50 pounds and keep them off.  For the past five years, she has been helping others hear the voice of Our Lady of Weight Loss through her life coaching, motivational speakin, creative artwork, and Kick in the Tush Club (visit www.ourladyofweightloss.com for more information). And because of her growing success, she decided to write a book about her experiences to help even more people discover what she and her faithful flock have found. The book is entitled "Our Lady of Weight Loss: Miraculous and Motivational Musings from the Patron Saint of Permanent Fat Removal."  The Our Lady principles entail the following: - Seeking the weight loss help of those who have gone before you - Becoming a weight loss artist to divert attention away from food - Instead of obsessing with food, try doing something artistic - Join a support group to share ideas and stay accountable - Feeling the urge to move and shake your body - Offer an all-inclusive, spiritual journey towards health  Still a little freaked out by this? Nah, you shouldn't be. Janice Taylor is a real person who did something about her weight and now stand ready to pour every ounce of creative energy into helping others lose weight, too.  This is arguably the most unique weight loss book I think I have ever put my hands on. It's unconventional and Janice seems to like it that way because it fits her personality, too. You get the feeling she's definitely tried all the drab and dry diets that have ever been created and decided that enough was enough. She wanted to jack up the creative mojo to make this book like none other on the market today. Did she ever!  Our Lady of Weight Loss is loaded not only with helpful weight loss advice in the most peculiar way, but also many delicious-looking recipes. However, I must warn those of you who are livin' la vida low-carb--the recipes are not very low-carb, but rather low-fat and low-calorie. I don't bemoan Janice for putting these in her book, but I thought my fellow low-carb friends should be forewarned.  Nevertheless, I like the genuinely fresh approach that Janice Taylor brings to the weight loss world which will forever change what you think about weight loss books. My impression of this woman is that she is having fun while doing something meaningful in the lives of so many. If that is the formula for success that works for people to help them lose weight and get healthy, then keep on beckoning the call of Our Lady of Weight Loss.   As someone who has lost 180 pounds myself, I am all in favor of people finding SOMETHING that will work for them. Our Lady of Weight Loss may be just the thing that helps you attain the Holy Grail of the obese: lasting and permanent weight loss. Haaaaaaallelujah 
 John Stuart Mill was raised by his father to be his intellectual heir, and a great genius. There is something moving about the care taken by the father to teach his wunderkind son all that he knew. The father was with Jeremy Bentham the guiding spirit of the philosophical movement  Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism was a mechanical kind of philosophy which thought it possible to measure the goodness of action by measuring the amount of pleasure against the amount of pain. Mill followed the path his father set out from him, adopted his father's values and social conscience and was already by the tender age of twenty a distinguished intellectual figure. But then he asked himself the question if the realization of all his social schemes and all the grand social ideals would bring him happiness. And he understood that it would not. He understood in other words that all this focus on outward good and action, on mechanical measures for human life was missing some vital component in life and in himself. Mill went into a great depression. What brought him out was the reading of the poetry of Wordsworth and the understanding that there is a dimension of feeling, a dimension of the inner life which is somehow more important than all the social thought. This did not mean that Mill abandoned the path of social reform but rather that he changed its direction. Part of this change had to do with his meeting his relationship with Harriet Taylor, his embracing in a certain sense of liberal ideas on the role of women in society. Mill found himself and continued on his intellectual path, a path which would lead him to produce one of the masterpieces of modern political thought, "On Liberty ". 
 I am a huge Linda Howard fan - I have read everything she has had printed and this is one of hers that is on my keeper shelf! I absolutely loved this book! Romantic thrillers are my favorite kind of book and the hero and heroine are splendid! My dream man? Detective "Doc" Cahill!!! Handsdown - my favorite hero of any book I have ever read!! Take charge, cocky, capable, smart - and SEXY!! When I read it, I gave him the looks of actor Gerard Butler!! Dear heavens - if that isn't everything any red blooded woman could ever want! I don't understand any woman not thoroughly enjoying this book!!! 
 ...and reading Mr. Silbers book has convinced me of this.  Mr. Silber shows you how to set goals for money management and artistic endeavors without putting your life on hold.  You can pay your bills and still pursue your art.  This book shows you the way and explains how it is all about choices.  The choices we make.  The author's writing style makes the book fun to read and his easy to understand philosophy makes it believable 
 Although this book was published in 1957, and does not even mention DNA or Watson and Crick, it still provides what is in my mind a very accurate picture of how scientific research is really performed. It takes some getting used to Beveridge's style and the old examples can appear to be ancient at first, I found that in the end I could not put this book down. It offers a complete overview of all the steps involved in scientific discoveries (reason, chance, intuition and strategy) that still holds true for the 21st century. This is a great book for anyone starting in science and also for those who are going through a rough time when results are not coming along as smoothly as one might hope: it is a strong reminder that science really is an art 
 The book I ordered was brand new and I saved so much from the retail price!  The best part was that it qualified for free shipping and it came within 4 days!!  What a surprise that was!  I have to say that I am extremely delighted to use amazon and this seller.  
 Ellen Ensher is Associate Professor at the College of Management at Loyola Marymount, and Susan Murphy Associate Professor at Claremont McKenna College: each has written and consulted both together and independently and here produces a powerful collaboration on mentoring and its lasting benefits to both mentor and prot?g?. Mentoring has a powerful influence on successful people: that's been proven; but traditional models of mentoring haven't kept up with business programs that have different emphasis today than in past.

 Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?  Who says an arrogant guy can't write a helpful book?   There are a lot of people who don't like this book.  Some don't like it, because they perceive Lewis V. Gerstner as arrogant.  Some don't like it, because his tenure at IBM saw thousands of people lose their jobs.  Some don't like it, because they don't think there is anything new here.  I like this book.   I like the book, because it is one of the most cogently and personally presented stories I've seen of a major corporate turnaround by the person who was in the CEO's job at the time.  Here's a quick outline of the story.  Gerstner became Chairman and CEO of IBM in April, 1993.  At that time, IBM, once the icon of American management, was in big trouble.  The deathwatch was on.  The conventional wisdom among the pundits was that IBM needed to be broken up and sold off piece by piece to create lots of small businesses that would create income for shareholders.   This was the heyday of the dot com boom.  Smaller, networked computers were expected to rule the future. Big mainframe computers, the stuff that IBM sold, were supposed to be the troglodytes of American business, and heading for extinction.    Gerstner came to IBM after being a McKinsey consultant and after a successful eleven-year career at American Express, and four years as Chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco.  He describes what he calls "the courtship" that brought him to IBM in the beginning of this book.  The company he took over was once seen as the very model of the best in management.  When I was starting out in business some thirty-five years ago, we looked to IBM as an exemplar of all that was good, effective and profitable.  In 1982, Peters and Waterman featured IBM in "In Search of Excellence," with a long list of references in the index.  But by the time Gerstner took over many of the things that had made IBM great had fossilized. Many of the practices that had been touchstones had turned into radioactive rocks.   Gerstner started off with three critical challenges.  He needed to stop the hemorrhaging of cash and stabilized the company.  He needed to learn enough about the business and the people he had walked into to make good strategic choices.  And he needed to put together a strategy to turn IBM around.  This book tells us about how he did all of those things.  It does so candidly and that's one of the reasons I like the book.   While lots of people see Gerstner as arrogant, I found him, at least in this book, to be humble.  That doesn't mean that he didn't think he had a lot to offer and had made lots of good decisions.  It does mean that he understood that many of his decisions didn't work out the way he thought, and some of his ideas weren't the best.  Those get play, too, and that's rare in a book like this.  I also appreciated the refreshing style of the book.  It was not written with a ghostwriter or co-author.  Gerstner did it himself.  The language may not be the language that a professional writer would have chosen.  But it is the language that's common to businesspeople everywhere, and that makes this a good read.  The big advantage of this is that we get a real view inside the head of someone who led a successful corporate turnaround. We don't get a view that's filtered through a collaborator.   Because Gerstner wrote the book, it's short on some of the details that might be here if a business historian or journalist did the writing.  For my money, that's OK, because this is a real inside view.  This book is for you if you want a lucid discussion of a difficult turnaround process by the CEO who did the CEO's job.  It is all of that and a good read besides. 
 Excellent, recommend without reservation.  Note: for anyone like me who is hooking it up to an older G4 desktop 450, I also needed to buy a Radeon Graphics card for about $200, which included the DVI to VGA connector.  I would have considered a new hard  drive, but what with the intel flurry still going on, seemed best to wait. The 23" seems huge and I am glad I did not go with the 30". I saw comments about redness, etc., and my experience is that the screen renders image color and resolution accurately and beautifully. I now see onscreen what I used to have to print out to check with the older mac 17" 
 Wow! This is one of those real life adventure stories that has you wondering how much more the people can endure before they collapse and die. These guys climbed one of the world's most difficult mountains with old climbing technology. What they lacked in modern equipment, they made up for with strength and fitness. The more I read about mountaineering, the more I agree that it is 75% mental and 25% physical. Being in the best physical condition possible definitely gives you a better opportunity for success on high ground. If you liked this book, I encourage you to read my book "Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection". Best wishes on your adventures in life 
 While working on my Masters in B-School, I remember the enriching lessons from a Marketing Director of a Fortune 10 company. As I steer through the real world of business as a marketer and strategist, find it true to words.   His message was crisp (an MBA from Kellogg); that after learning a lot of theories and analytical tools, at the end of the day, marketing is all about SPTC (Segmentation, Positioning, Targeting and Commonsense) coupled with clear and effective  communication. This book will deliver you these simple basics of marketing based on common sense. As one proceeds through the book, the basic factors of marketing will unveil from a layman's perspective. USP of this book is that you can refresh / understand the basics of marketing while flying from Philadelphia to Chicago (2.5hours).  However, this book won't put folks like us (Marketers/Strategists/Consultants) out of business. Rather, it would be a good idea to gift this book to your CEO/Director/Client to emphasize the need of a clear and simple marketing strategy which must be transmitted across the organization to achieve common goals.  Folks who want to make the next move in understanding the basics of marketing after reading this book might consider getting a hand on "Preface to Marketing Management" by Peter & Donnelly (9th edition). Another simple book but would call for a return flight between JFK and Heathrow.  
 I remember reading this and being overwhelmed by its energy, its humor and its human feeling. One Amazon reviewer Deborah L. Cohen wrote beautifully about the way Little Big Man parallels Huckleberry Finn in the guilt , shame doubt which comes with favoring the underdog ( in Huck's case Jim, and in Little Big Man's The Indians) over his own native race and people. This book is filled with  humor and real human sympathy. It is a terrific read and  I highly recommend it. 
 There were to many curse words in the story. It's about a fat girl (Susan) who has a gay friend(Brendon). They both get in trouble and have to go to an after school activity called Alt Ed.  In that activity they meet a nice boy(Randy), a cheerleader (Tracie), and a tough girl (Amber). There is a mean boy (Kale) who makes fun of them all. Everytime they meet in meetings they learn new things about each other 
 This movie is gritty, realistic and pulls no punches as a hard hitting look at the drug trade. This movie is like a semi documentary with a stellar ensemble cast. Miguel Ferrer gives a powerful performance as a jaded, cynical drug runner and I have liked him as an actor since I saw him in "The Stand". Catherine Zeta Jones' character evolves  from a happy everyday pregnant suburban housewife to cold blooded drug dealer with a very believable  performance. Also the young actres who plays Michael Douglas' daughter in this fim gives a very solid performance as well.This movie exposes the underbelly of the illicit drug trade and was most deserving of the Academy Awards that it received. Watch this movie and you will never think of drugs in a  so called "harmless , recreational " way again 
 This horse is just a bit smaller than the normal Traditional horse but just as good. The racetrack set also fits this horse for those of you who own that. I defiantly recoummend this horse to you!  -CM February 4th, 200 
 Reading a Spenser story is always a pleasure.  Robert B. Parker is succinct and witty, his characters are engaging, his Boston is a living backdrop, and his plots are just plausible enough to drive the narrative.  Sure, there are continuity and logic issues from time to time; so call his editor.  The point of a Spenser read should not be unraveling the perfect crime (look at his criminals - hardly masterminds, after all).  Every Spenser book is about people: what makes them tick, how they think, why they do the things they do.  If you love the Spenser cast, you'll love Hundred-Dollar Baby; it's old home week in Boston.  This was my favorite Spenser story since Small Vices.  Read and enjoy 
 Listening to this make me feel 12 years old again 
 The Image of Christ provides an overview of the heritage of Christian art, from paintings and prints to sculptures from the early Christian era to modern times, examining the purposes for each and exploring their meaning  to viewers. Depictions of Christ via symbol and image are examined in a  treatise recommended for art libraries and religious holdings alike 
 After seeing this book on several times at my local magic shop, I finally bought it here. The list price is (...), but I paid less (...) here and it was new in plastic wrap too. It is an absolutely fabulous book with very detailed illustrations and numerous color picture. Worth much more than they ask for! It's an invaluable reference also for magic lovers 
 This is a great book! I love it!   I must confess, I am generally a slow reader, and often find that if a book is not exceptional it will end up back on my shelf, half read. Not so with this one; I finished it in just a few sessions. It is not a particularly thick book, and if you tend to judge the value of your education in pounds per $, you should probably give this a skip. However, if you want a book that is going to get to the heart of the matter, in an easy-to-read, conversational manner, this is it.   This book is packed with "wealth truth" ... that's the best way I can think to describe it ... fundamental truth about wealth, wealth creation, money, time, knowledge ... truth that, when internalized and applied, has the potential to transform one's future.  I highly recommend this book! It will be a solid investment in your financial future 
 Say what you will about James Patterson--the man knows how to keep the pages turning.  Having gotten hooked on Alex Cross when ALONG CAME A SPIDER debuted in 1993, it's been fascinating to watch both Cross and his creater evolve.  The books have gotten shorter (CROSS is at least 20,000 words less than SPIDER) and the pace has gotten faster (90 chapters for SPIDER, 121 for CROSS.) Patterson wants you to turn pages, and turn them quickly. He accomplishes this by streamlining the story--CROSS is all dialog and action. There is minimal setting description, very little exposition, and no padding at all. It's lean and fast.  As a result, many readers will be able to finish this in one or two sittings.  But is shorter and faster actually better?  In the case of CROSS, yes. By cutting away the fat, Patterson has managed engage the reader more completely. Why spend 500 pages on a story that only needs 380? If the purpose of thriller fiction is to find out what happens next, then the writing is there to serve the story, rather than the story being there to serve the writing.  I wouldn't say the plot of CROSS is superior to any of Patterson's other novels, or the villain more terrifying, but it certainly gets to the point faster, and in my opinion that makes it a better book 
 Our book club split right down the middle about this book. It had been a close call in any case to pick on Amy Scheibe as our August selection, because the more intellectual faction wanted to go for Thomas Pynchon's GRAVITY'S RAINBOW. But the stay at home moms (SAHMs) among us said they were curious and this book was said to be an American version of I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT, with some SEX AND THE CITY elements added into the mix, and so we decided to put off the Pynchon till November just in time to read the new Pynchon (December 1, club members!) over the Christmas holiday break when everyone is tired of giving, tired of celebrating, and hopefully we will all have received lots of gift certificates to independent bookstores and of course to dear old Amazon.  As I say, some of us liked the book, others thought it atrocious. Let me summarize my feelings about Jennifer Bradley, the heroine, with the two cute kids, Max, a baby, and Georgia, the 4 year old with the personality of an unpleasant Christina Ricci. I admired Jennifer's fight for independence and I sympathized with the way she was forced to talk with kids on a much lower mental level than her own, not to mention, we all enjoyed the open frankness of her sexuality, however some of us did note that it seemed like a tip of the old derby to Carrie Bradshaw and the rest of the SEX AND THE CITY girls. Close your eyes and you're by your window waiting for Mr. Big and admiring your Jimmy Choos. It's a far cry from GRAVITY's RAINBOW. Thom, the husband, we all though adorable. He was supporting of Jennifer's need to work, and we were all happy when her office transfer to Chelsea allowed her to go home for lunch and see the kids. When she had the run-in with the eclair, we all figured, maybe she was getting cancer God forbid, and thank God it turned out into the surprise ending that topped THE DA VINCI CODE in suspense.  Jennifer's nasty, selfish attitude we chalked up to the fact that her birth mother had died in a traffic accident, wrapping her car around a tree in the very first weeks of jennifer's life. Although she denies having any memory of her mom, it seemed clear to the thoughtful ones in our club that she was, in fact, the victim of trauma, and unless she dealt with it, she would never be happy, she would always be whining and complaining and finding the grass greener on the other side. Thus she was doomed to live the life of Emma Bovary, and then, from out of the past, she finds out a certain shocking fact about her birth mother, and her whole world goes to pieces!  If I told you what it was, you would keel over in a faint. Here in San Francisco, I found it difficult to relate to the nonstop materialism of Thom and Jennifer, their lifestyles involved always keeping up with what the other parents' children could afford to do for their kids. July's read was a double scoop of GOSSIP GIRL versus E.L. Doctorow, and we saw right away how little Georgia was going to turn into a gossip girl when she got a little older, and also how the whole nation could split on issues like racism and slavery, devolving into the Civil War, which almost replicated itself in the split dividing our book club, but on the whole, as Jennifer learns in WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY?, compromise works miracles 
    The crystal light iced tea brand tastes better than all the regular sugared, as well as, the low-calorie sweetened teas.If you like it a bit sweeter, put an extra pack of splenda in it 
 Captures great in a Sony TR7000 camcorder. Works great in both Hi8 and  Digital8 modes, though only captures 60 minutes in Digital8 format. The  tapes retained clarity and sound quality after multiple edits. The material  of the tape is the second-highest quality used in Sony tapes 
 Admittedly I'm a music lover, not a technophile.  I'm more interested in Charlie Watts than I am in watts per channel.  But my ear is well tuned and I know what sounds good.  It would seem that there is some Bose backlash out there; perhaps in response to the Rolls Royce reputation it's carried through the years.  I don't know, and frankly I don't care.    I will tell you that I bought my pair not as part of a surround system but as bookshelf speakers for my small home office and I couldn't be happier.  They're attractive, have a low profile, and provide total range at all volumes.  I tested them in the store with CDs that had lots of challenging highs, sizzling cymbals, that sort of thing.  The definition was clear as can be.  When you crank them up the sound holds together beautifully, no mud, no distortion.  I find that solo piano is another good way to test speaker clarity, I went with The Koln Concert by Keith Jarrett and the results were mesmerizing.    As far as bass response is concerned, good grief, what's the fuss?  Even at low volumes I can hear Mingus plucking the strings, when I listen carefully I can even hear him dropping ironic hints.  As to the higher register, that's where the clarity of these speakers really shines, Stephanie Mills soars and swoops like an angel.    Then of course there are those irresponsible moments when I simply must blow off a little steam.  Out comes the Coltrane, Ayler, Dolphy, Hendrix, Winter, Tower Of Power and up goes the volume.  The desk toys start dancing because everything in the room is vibrating.  Even then, these unassuming monsters deliver like tomorrow might never come.  I've held minority opinions in the past and I'll hold another here, as far as I'm concerned these speakers are fantastic and actually under-priced.          
 i felt a little wierd going through the check-out line with a book "on being a man" when i am a female, but i am certainly glad I did. this book will not only help you know yourself more if you are a man- it will help woman to understand men better so they can understand and empathize better 
 'Sanditon' is by far my favourite romance novel. Although it is technically only half-Austen, it has bypassed my beloved Austen books, including 'Mansfield Park' and 'P&P'. It is one of the most charming books I've ever read, with a wonderful hero and very likeable heroine. Charlotte Heywood is invited to the seaside resort of Sanditon by Mr. and Mrs. Parker, and while there, meets a variety of characters, ranging from the ever-suspicious Lady Denham to a lovelorn Henry Brudenall. She also meets Mr. Parker's younger brother, Sidney, a witty, intelligent and charming young man, who soon works his way into her heart.   Surprisingly enough, Jane Austen's part in it: the first 11 chapters - are actually the most boring parts of the book. It picks up life in the 11th chapter, when Sidney Parker is introduced. From there comes a series of amusing excursions, laugh-out-loud events and characters, witty dialogues, and sweet romances. 'Another Lady' managed to flesh out the characters that Austen introduced, making them her own while keeping them in good characterisation. Although lacking in Austen's clever, satirical writing and details, 'Another Lady' made up for it by injecting a large amount of humor and wit. Critics may say that the twist at the end is very unAusten-like, but it can be forgiven for being incredibly funny. Thumbs up to 'Another Lady' for a fantastic job done, and I think even Austen would have enjoyed the book 
 I found this to be an excellent resource to help locate books with black boys as main characters.  This book is divided into different sections --- preschoolers and upward --- which helps you select age appropriate titles. Wonderfully detailed descriptions and opinions of books are given as well as publisher information, etc.  Books are of a great variety (educational, entertaining, etc.).  Certain authors are highlighted with a biographical sketch.  Also highlighted are real black boys of various ages who briefly tell of there favorite book.  I never new that 90% of these books existed 
 This is a great stool and I would recommend it for anyone who needs this type of stool.  It is small enough to fit in a tub as it was advertized 
 Anita baker is just an all time great singer. her voice can't be copied she has a very unique style and voice that makes you want to hear more 
 Monster is a little pricey, as everyone knows, but it's good stuff.  This unit is attractive, works well and is nicely designed.  Only one very small drawback: unless you have small pointy fingers, the first battery is a little hard to remove.  I use a little plastic relay tool to lever it out, which I store right in the charger.  But I stayed with 5 stars for this one 
 I have been looking for this CD for years. When I was little I said "I don't Care" all the time when I was asked a question. My parents played it for me. I own the CD and plan to play it for my daughter.  I wish they would release the cartoons on DVD 
 I think this is a must read book for every preschool teacher because this book will teach them what they did not learn in training 
 Well to be honest you can't lose yourself in all parts of the CD, and more's the pity. This CD is on the brink of masterpiece that You Forgot It In People achieved, but there are some tracks that ruin the beautiful and ethereal atmosphere the first half establishes and only resumes near the end. My ratings:  1. I Slept With Bonhomme At The CBC: 9/10, mmm what a way to start it, beautiful, mesmorizing, enchanting, etc. etc. 2. Guilty Cubicles: 9/10, it continues, this track blends flawlessly with the previous and continues the beauty. 3. Love And Mathematics: 11/10! Yes it goes off my own scale, my favorite jam song ever, it's like a drum fiesta with guitars swooping and diving around the core drum beats! Best track on the album by far! 4. Passport Radio: 8.5/10, dreamy vocals, dreamy guitars, it's all-around... what's the word... dreamy! 5. Alive In 85: 9/10, very catchy, makes me want to bounce, quite a nice poppy feel to it you can't help but like. 6. Prison Province: 5/10, yuck! I mean... why? They were on a role, they were kicking ass, but this song is the first of the "bad half" of the CD. 7. Blues For Uncle Gibb: 6.5/10, very dark, and not very pleasant. I somewhat enjoy the haunting hermonica, but the rest? No. 8. Stomach Song: 6/10, this song sounds like it emerged from the stomach, so in a way it's fitting. It's grating and annoying. 9. Massbroker: 7.5/10, cheer up, things are getting a little better! While the violin squeeks like a dying animal at the beginning, it gets better toward the end. 10. Feel Good Lost: 7/10, I love the name, but as title tracks go this is just too weird and too short. 11. Last Place: 9.5/10, yes, back in action! This 8-minute-long track is amazing, your ultimate roadtrip song, it makes me think of rolling plains of grass. 12. Cranley's Gonna Make It: 9.5/10, triumphant finish, one of the catchiest songs on the album, and I love how it ends so breathlessly, just like you feel after this album's rollercoaster of sounds concludes.  If it weren't for the dark and dreary middle of this CD (which some could argue is necessary, as it completes the voyage this CD takes you on), I would rate the album a 5. As it is, I treasure the truly great songs off this album as some of the best instrumental rock songs ever made, and I am so happy Broken Social Scene is only continuing to get better with time 
 The book was rated as in very good shape. I was amazed at the condition. It looks and feels brand new. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank yo 
 I just bought Mary Mary last week, my first book I have read by James Patterson and could hardly put it down.I bought 2 more( Alex Cross series) and read both within a week. Now today I just bought 2 more( Jack and Jill and Cat and Mouse and I am anxious to start them. They are all very scary and very hard to put down. I see Mr Patterson has written alot of books, should keep me busy for awhile 
 As a jazz fan and a professional music retailer, I can recommend this book as a wonderful place to begin one's discovery of jazz or gain more knowledge of the cultural legacy of the music. In conjunction with the excellent video series and a box of cds by the titans written about by Ward, ie. Armstrong, Ellington, Davis, Parker, Holiday, etc., one can have a wonderful adventure either discovering the music for the first time or revisiting and expanding old passions. Those who quibble with its incompleteness run the risk of branding themselves cynics after the fashion of Wilde's definition: "A man who knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.&quot 
 I found this music a little slow at times, but it has thoughtful lyrics and would make good background music or just for relaxation 
 I enjoyed reading this collection of "some of the best bloggers". Actually, I think it was just some of the best blog entries they could find. Which is not to say they aren't good because I'm saying here I totally enjoyed the reading. Just don't forget there's more out there. After you get this book, don't forget to go to your local internet and browse 
 There's something very odd going on in rural Moose County and that something is thievery. The people of this area just aren't used to this kind of behavior and normally don't bother locking up anything but the times they are a changing. At first it isn't anything big that goes missing and most people including Jim Qwilleran can't understand why anyone would steal a pair of cheap sunglasses or a bag of old clothes. Then things get serious when the local banker who is a newcomer to Pickax City is killed in a mugging. Since the murder occurred while that banker was on a business trip to a big city down below however most people just write it up to how terrible things are in big cities. The ever-alert Koko however smells a rat.  As the plot thickens there is as always lots of other action in progress. Qwilleran and Polly have an argument over her cat's name, which prompts him to write a column in the local paper about the subject, which brings in a deluge of postcards with appropriate names for cats. The area is planning a huge ice festival, which is threatened by the possibility of an early thaw. Qwill and the cats are ensconced in the Indian Village apartments for the winter because their barn is so hard to heat and they end up living next to the radio weatherman whom Qwill does not care for. The weatherman, Wetherby Goode by name has been a background player in this series since the action moved to Moose County but in this installment he plays a major role and he and Qwill become fast friends.  When one of the leading citizens of Pickax dies the action becomes fast and furious and Qwilleran doesn't believe it was natural causes for a minute. Koko has been trying to tell him all along but as usual he just didn't get the point. Koko ends up being so frustrated that he starts walking over to Yum Yum and bopping her on the head like it was her fault that Qwill is a little dense at times.   All in all this entry into this lovable series will keep you guessing while at the same time tickling your funny bone as you read of the antics of the local residents. People of Scottish decent will particularly like this book as the normal Scottish flavor of the stories is kicked up a notch and Qwill finally makes his public debut in a kilt.  In the end of course the guilty are thwarted and justice prevails but this road to justice is one of the most enjoyable journeys that you will ever take 
 I like the trend in cookbooks towards simple, quick meals.  How many of us have the time to take hours to prepare a meal outside of the holidays?  Mexican cooking can be intimidating but Rick Bayless takes the complication out of it with this great book of simple yet delicious recipes.  While the recipes are designed to be prepared in 30 minutes, I think the average home cook will be looking at 15 - 30 minutes longer, depdending on thier skill and quickness.  Still, even 45 minutes isn't bad for some of these recipes.  Rick has essentially dumbed down the recipes to make the preperation with more common ingredients, easily found in your pantry or grocery store.  While the recipes may be scaled down and simplified, there certainly seems to be no effect on the taste.  His tips for cutting prep time are not only vital to the recipes in this book, but to your home cooking in general.  The book is laid out by section in the usual manner:  Salads, side dishes, soups, main dishes, desserts, etc...I'm still not all that experimental so the section on Tacos, enchiladas, tostadas, was my favorite and my family and I really enjoyed the varitions on these more common dishes such as the green chile chicken tacos, as well as the grill prepared recipes as we grill a lot.  The Chicken Tortilla soup with Avacado was another winner.    Rick proves that Mexican need not be intimidating and time consuming.  This is a book that I am happy to have in my collection 
 If it's the last thing I do, I'm going to that Auberge! (if only it were still there) The way he describes his first steps into the hidden valley, sound like the opening to The Sound of Music ... I read this book with growing love and fascination. It inspired me to study cooking at the French Culinary Institute. I haven't tried these specific recipes yet, though they sound like French classics. Thank you, thank you, for telling this story 
 This is a wonderful presentation of the original story without the moralisms of Disney's adaptation. There is bad and good luck, cunning, bravery and dealing with tough situations without whining.  This leaves room for children to respond to the story and interpret it. My two year old grandson loved it, even if he didn't know what a churn was. The drawings are stylish. I recommend it as an addition to your basic library of classic children's tales 
 I've tried various ocean surf CDs as a sleep aide. None works as well as this one. The rhythmic surf, uncluttered by gulls and foghorns and music, relaxes me more than anything else did.   Read the other favorable customer comments again, and believe them.  This CD is really that good 
 Not just for the good writing, organization and fascinating topic, but also for the fact that i've read this book twice, and last night started browsing through it again - one of those books that is worth keeping and reading again every few years.  The depth, complexity of some of the alchemists' illustrations are explained in detail.  I also like the interleaving of ordinary descriptive material with story - like the story of Balinas at the start of the book or an imaginary visit with Hermes 
 DJ Quik hits the mainstream with a bang in "Quik Is The Name." Here, he starts his trademark old school P-Funk vibe that would be prevalent in most of his future work. Sure, Dre deserves a lot of the credit for starting the G-Funk craze of the 90's, but Quik deserves at least as much of the credit too!! His beats are nothing short of phenomenal. The beat on "Tonite" is ahead of its time; it sounds like it could have came out in '95 or '96. He keeps it old school on tracks like "8 Ball" and "Quik Is The Name." His rhyming is good and his style is entertaining. The songs are funky, laced with the twist of the turntable. He isn't too hard core, but he still has a street credibility. Cop it!!!!       dj quik tonite tha best song there is man 
 Great movie.  Alright, Alright!  This movie is a classic and everyone should own it 
 A very scietific view of hypnosis, but, to me, the author didn't really want to prove that hypnosis was real.  Still it was informative and entertaining 
 This book examines the history of scientific discovery and scientific thought related to the cosmos, our place in it, and the origins of life, and argues that our presence on this planet is innately intertwined with our awareness of the cosmos at large.  Specifically, the authors argue that the conditions that make a planet conducive to producing technologically advanced life forms such as ourselves are essentially identical to the conditions needed to explore the world and the space around it.  These conditions include the type and age of star, the number, type and orbits of the other planets, the presence of a satellite (our Moon) of a specific size, composition, and orbit, a location within a specific area of the Milky Way Galaxy, being located within a galaxy of a specific type, age, and location in the universe, and being in a universe where the various physical constants (gravity, electron mass, electron charge, etc...) have just the right values.  The book also examines the validity of various philosophies relating to man's and Earth's place in the heavens.  This book is not a direct argument for the existence of God, or some grand creator.  It is an argument for order, in that it shows that the geological and cosmological factors needed for technologically advanced life such as ourselves are not that common in our galaxy, and hence advanced life itself might not be that common.  All in all a great book 
 The thing impressed me most, is the way she writes and the easiness she explains difficult concepts. Now let me tell you something about its content.  The topic is about the way humans have been considering beauty during these last two hundred years, the  writer draws her attention on woman and the way they use, they feel, and the things they do for the sake of  it. The writer tends to divide the book into to sections: the first deals with the origins and the way humans  had dealt with it. In the second part the writer draws her attention more on the relation exists between  cultures, human relations, religions and the concept of beauty.  Towards the middle of the book, these concepts are recalled. By reading this book; it comes out that human   beauty has always been playing a key role in society, in economy and in humane relations. This book is written by a woman for women; I do think that men should read it as well, because it is worth  
 As any reader of his famous People's History of the United States knows, Howard Zinn never ceases to challenge the dominant orthodoxies of history.  In this book, Zinn demonstrates how he embodied this effort in his own life, from his time as a teacher at a black women's college in Georgia and his involvement in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, though his protests against the Vietnam War to his years opposing John Sibler at Boston University  The result is an inspiring read, though one marred by the odd organization of the book.  By choosing to focus on the campaigns he waged against the problems he encountered, Zinn provides less a traditional autobiography than an account of his public career.  As a result, the reader is left to piece together the narrative of Zinn's life, which can be frustrating when seeking to understand how he became such a fervent activist to begin with.  This is the only complaint with what is otherwise a passionate account of how one person can make a difference in the times in which he lives 
 ...well, I'd rather have a masseuse in house and on-demand, but the Theracane is a great substitute.  I had tried using tennis balls and rolling on them, but the Theracane is not only more effective, but easier to use.  I'm going to buy some for friends with the same age related neck aches 
 Nora, "They say you were shot in the Tabloids."  Nick, "It didn't come anywhere near my Tabloids!"  Need I say more?  Just buy it because there's plenty more where that came from 
 This was one of the best Flynn books and I've read them, in order, needing only to read Memorial Day and Consent to Kill.  Once again, a good share of violence, sneaky politicians, and backstabbing.  This book has a scene in the Phillipines that is really well done.  Irene Kennedy's character is becoming much more well rounded and the "wife" is still a pain.  I keep hoping Mitch Rapp will dump her 
 For many the term 'Socratic' evokes the countenance of the hemlock-drinking gadfly of Greek antiquity or the pedagogy of the iconic Professor Kingsfield in the 1973 film, "The Paper Chase."  For author Ronald Gross, the designation is symbolic not just of a man or inquisitional teaching style, but also of a distinctive and rewarding orientation to life itself, one he claims to have - - - and makes a compelling case for believing he has - - - lived for the past twenty years.  Socrates' Way introduces this approach, personified by the ancient philosopher some of us thought we knew but didn't, or at best knew only superficially from some long-forgotten Western Civilization class.  By reputation most of us are acquainted with Socrates the provocateur and logician, ever-ready to deflate an untested assumption or weak argument with pointed and masterfully-aimed questions.  Fewer of us are familiar with the other Socrateses revealed in this book: the friend, the conversationalist, the bon vivant, the citizen,  the soldier, and the student.  As the author points out, these and other lesser-known faces of the legendary philosopher represent personal potentialities that we can develop if we are willing to follow his example as embodied in the Seven Keys, to which each a full chapter is dedicated.  As with many of the authors' previous works such as The Independent Scholars' Handbook and Peak Learning, Socrates' Way is a chockablock with his trademark blend of reasoned encouragement, concrete examples and practical applications.  Some may find certain Keys (e.g. "Grow With Friends") difficult at best and impracticable at worst in what appears at times to be an increasingly anti-intellectual age.  If such is the case it is worth noting that Socrates himself did not always find such precepts easy to observe, as his ultimate demise demonstrates.  That said,  I cannot imagine anyone's days not being enriched by embracing at least one of these principles.  Socrates' famous dictum pronounces that "the unexamined life is not worth living."  Given the example of the full-blooded Greek sage so ably portrayed in the pages of this book, one is inclined to believe he would similarly admonish that the unlived life is not worth examining.    Socrates' Way shows us not only how to explore such a life, but how to walk a path befitting such scrutiny. 
 For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate "companion" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.      
 Lori and Becky use a solid faith-based framework in walking us through a practical approach to Christian parenting.  Their book guides parents in their journey to raise children with a foundation of strong values.  It is truly a gift to all parents 
 In this The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of Our Canine Companions, Stanley Coren looks at how dogs think and what they feel by analyzing their actions.  He begins by providing a persuading argument that dogs do think and show emotions.  Then an interesting history is given of the views on the dog's mind throughout history, along with the three main proposed views of what dogs were first domesticated and used by people.  Coren provides a few sections that are especially useful in interpreting what your dog is thinking or trying to say.  I am a veterinary assistant and am around a lot of dogs all day, and these lists did provide me with some new information.   	The book also talks about the three different kinds of intelligence that dogs have.  Coren clearly describes adaptive, working, and instinctive intelligence with the use of many personal examples.  These examples are often interesting and entertaining to the reader, while strengthening Coren's point.  In addition, Coren provides tips for the reader to evaluate his own dog's intelligence.  I found the canine intelligence test and the personality test to be a fun activity for both me and my dog.  The intelligence test helps you understand how your dog's intelligence compares to the rest of the dog world.  The personality test determines what kind of personality your dog has and what the best techniques are for training it. 	The last few chapters of the book describe useful techniques for increasing a dog's intelligence and an easy-to-understand description of how the dog's brain works.  The tips for improving my dog's intelligence seem to be really practical.  The explanation of the science of the dog's brain is surprisingly easy to comprehend.  Coren explains the brain's complexity in everyday terms. Overall, this book is very informative of the dog's mind, and it also seems to be partly biographical with all of Coren's stories and explanations of how he reaches his conclusions and conducts his research.  This slight mixture of genres keeps me from becoming bored with an only informative book.  I definitely recommend this book to any dog enthusiasts that are looking for an informative and entertaining book to read 
 Finally, someone heard my prayers! Now my great-great-great-great grand children will "enjoy" this LFG collection........ 
 They are garbage bags, so how worked up can you get 
 This is a first for me of Cindy Gerard.  Fast paced, fairly good thriller and hot romance.  I give it an 8 out of 10 for sensuality.   Darcy and Ethan have been divorced for 5 years, yet cannot forget each other.  He is special forces. Darcy gets into a jam and leaves a cryptic message begging him to rescue her.  The chapters waffle from the present to five years ago.  Both scenerios are interesting and exciting.  The ending of each chapter makes you frustrated that you are going back 5 years, but it is well worth it.  Quick read. I shall look for others by Ms. Gerard.   
 Nothing replaces your own family doctor or specialist.  Diabetes is a serious condition and sometimes requires medication to treat it or its related conditions.  Having said that, I think it's wise to try to reduce or get off medication if you can AND you're doctor says it's OK.  If you're looking for ways to improve your lifestyle and do something about your condition besides taking pills, there's lots of information here 
 While i love this entire series and consider it one of my favorites, this is probably the best of the bunch. Here, at the beginning of his career, King created the centerpiece of his future works. Nearly all of King's books fit into the general framework of the Dark Tower and a few are directly related. It is telling that King works to include stealthy references to the series in many of his books.  But why is this the best of the series? It's hard for me to express. The writing conveys such an environment of grit, suffering, and entrapment for the ultimate anti-hero, Roland Deschain the last gunslinger, to fulfill his ultimate purpose within. The greatest success of this work lies in its genesis of this character. It is only because of King's surpriesing success at creating the dramatic and complex persona of his morally questionable protagainist that the, at first,apparently unwieldy and daunting task of writing such an expansive series was permitted to reach its final completion.  This book, and the series as a whole,is a great attempt at recreating the epic nature of life's journey towards destiny, purpose, and finally, its end 
 This is probably one of the most hilarious and satirical black comedies I own. Even though it is from the late eighties, it's a timeless gem, and when I need a good laugh, it's there. Just like New Yorker character yuppie literary genius, Peter says, "It never goes away".  Mind you, this is not a vampire movie, but a satirical view on a lonely young man that has "everything" falling apart. It all begins when he's getting ready to go to work and cuts himself shaving, and somehow he distortedly begins to think sex vixen Jennifer Beals who's supposedly a vampire bit him. From that point on it's a steady downward spiral of peculiar and weird scenarios to come; his personality becomes more erratic and his actions unpredictable and bizarre to say the least. He begins showing up to work in a suit, but no socks, becomes photophobic, and begins picking on his Cuban secretary played by Maria Conchita Alonso.  One of my favorite scenes is when he is at the psychiatrist office and he is standing on the ledge of the high-rise window holding a wooden stick, and he tells her he's going to go out there and find real love. The infamous scene when he eats the cockroach is a little disturbing, but you know they paid him good money to do so, but that's a good one too. I don't want to give the movie away since you must see it. At times while watching the movie, or at least the first time, you wonder what's real and what isn't, and it's a pit perturbing however at the end you can figure it out. Vampire's kiss is a satire about psychosis, and as you see, it doesn't care if you have a prestigious job or if you're a genius.  Every time I see a N. Cage movie I think of Peter, because there has to be just a little bit of him in there somewhere. 
 I read this book 25 years ago, and my daughter just finished it. Teenage selfishness and bravado give way to maturity, loyalty, and strong sense of self. A wonderful book 
 Emily Bartlett just wants a library. So, her mother writes in for one, and guess what! Pitchfork is going to have a library! While waiting for the books to arrive from Salem, Emily feeds the hogs a treat, bleeches a horse, and scares her cousin half to death. Mama doesn't really know how Emily can get into so much trouble, she just says "Emily, don't let your imagination run away with you!" Emily does try, but hey, if you live in the west, during a time when cars are new, airplanes are hardley ever seen, and no one has dreamed up the TV yet, what are you supposed to do 
 The cups a great for soups and other dining liquids. The bowls are Great also. I take care of my 82 year old grandmother & she just love how she can take a can of soup and poor it into the cup, cook it in the microwave then what she does not finish she can up the lid on and put it in the refrigerator. When she wants it again just take out of the frig. and put it directly in the microwave. Clean up is good also only on problem with them and that would be the lids. After a little time the plastic exsorbet a red tint from tomato based products. Other then this I'm buying them for all my friends as Christmas presents 
 This book helped me to teach four children to read in a month after they learned to speak. All four of these children developed a life long love of reading. This editon of the book is just as effective as the original in helping  parents overcome their prejudices about when and how babies can be taught. Another great book on how to be a great parent 
 Not only is the book fun to look at but the writing is top notch. The author adds a lot of incite and does a great job of describing the ideas behind the work. My personal faves include Jewboy, Thinkmule and Modern Dog. (The only mediocre work in the whole book is from Sandstrom, who seem sorely out of place). You'll love this book if you love art and design 
 I have to wonder how America's role in Guatemala's civil war and in the oppressive history of most Latin American countries has managed to escape your attention 
 This book is a great prep for the clep.  The reading material in the book isn't critical except for the 3 pages terms you need to memorize.  AGREED the practice tests in this book are more difficult than the actual clep so if you can pass the practice tests you're pretty much guaranteed to pass the clep.  My scores:  PT1:49, PT2:53, PT3:52, CLEP Test:64  I studied for about a week and a half with little prior literature knowledge.  Book helped most by telling you what terms to know and by explaining answers to practice test questions 
 Dr. Conley is passionate, articulate, and most important factual.  His information is new, refreshing, and expansive, while being based on sound medical principles 
 I read this book in about a day and 1/2.  I loved it.  I have 2 rescued dogs myself and cannot even imagine my life without them.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  The only thing was I wish that Mr. Foster would have put some pictures of his 3 dogs in the book.  My imagination told me what Brando, Zephyr and Sula looked like but I would have like to see them in photos.  I hope you write more books like this Mr. Foster.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one 
 Alison Krauss exhibits her laid back country and folk side along with her enchanting and airy pop vocals in "Forget About It".  My favorite is the first track, "Stay", however most songs on the album are strong.  This CD can be played in the background and keep you calm, or used for dance material with that special someone, or listened to intricately for its beauty.  Alison's unique sound is what makes this album - someone like LeAnn Rimes or Natalie Maines could handle the material, but it just would not be the same 
 After hearing their more recent albums, Old 97's "Hitchhike to Rome," sounded raw and unfocused.  Before long, though, the songs came through.  One by one they kept creeping into my head, drawing me back to  the album to hear the source.  I'll admit the delivery is suspect in some  cases (the brilliant "wish the worst" for example).  Some of  these songs need to be released in their present live incarnations to do  them justice.  For now just sing along real loud  and resist the urge to  drawl out that second verse in "Wish the Worst" 
 this book isnt for the beginner as the ritual and magick isnt explained to the detail one would require to practice successfully. however the information provided is good and detailed on the meanings of the rituals themselves and he has included quite a lot of interesting exercises also.  i would have to recommend don craigs book on high magick being by far the best beginning reference i personally have been able to find as yet (and i love books).  purchase this book if you want to deepen your knowledge but not recommended as a guide for the beginner.  ;) 
 Having heard so much about this book, and having seen the ABC TV movie, "The Mystery Of Natalie Wood" (which was based on this biography), I couldn't refrain from getting a copy and seeing for myself - I have been a fan of Natalie Wood since I was a teenager.  Suzanne Finstad did a commendable job, beginning from Wood's ancestral lineage (or as best could be told, since Maria Gurdin was known for misconstruing the facts and fantasizing an aristocratic or gypsy past).  The Romanovs and gypsy superstitions reigned in the lives of the Gurdins, which "Mud" inflicted on her appealing second daughter, Natasha.  This "Mommie Dearest" lived through this vulnerable child, all the while ignoring her other two girls, Olga and Lana, and relegating her husband Nicholai into the background.  This made for tension and domestic violence within the home as little Natasha morphed into "Natalie Wood" a child actress who was her family's breadwinner.  All the pressures and phobias took its toll on a frail psyche, with a stage mother from Hell always lurking in the shadows, whispering warnings of dark water, sex, and kidnapping, and never allowing her to be a child, or have playmates her own age.  Although she warned Natalie about intimate involvements with unknowns or males of her own age, Mud seems to have had no problem pushing the girl towards powerful Tinsletown personalities to further her career.  Even as an adolescent Natalie rebelled, the fears instilled in her scarred her for life, and played a part in many of her relationships, as well as her career.  A brutal rape at the hands of a famous actor (who is not named, although it's not too hard to guess his identity, as his family is still very active in the film industry, hint, hint), left her all the more traumatized, and unable to report the crime due to the studio system.  Her life had many twists and turns, such as an intense friendship with the ill-fated James Dean, an affair with a middle-aged director, and her marriages to Robert Wagner, which seemed to have much more drama than has ever been publicly acknowledged, and her long-awaited motherhood, only to have her life snuffed out by the element she feared beyond any other - water.  Some of her films are discussed in depth, as well as recalls by friends, coworkers, and her sisters. Robert Wagner refused to meet with Finstad, insisting that a more accurate account of Wood's life was upcoming - the result was "Natalie Wood: A Life" by Gavin Lambert (which, I think, was written as a rebuttal), and I couldn't help but notice that there are less favorable reviews for that biography.  There will probably always be a debate about Natalie's tragic death; there are so many unanswered questions, and until certain parties decide to talk (if ever), the truth may just be carried away with the tide.  Fly free, Natasha 
 This is a great book full of ideas for gifts. It's also a huge source for where to purchase the items 
 I bought this for my 4-yr old, but we are reading it as a family and all love it.  The story is of a boy that goes on a trip to save a baby dragon from the animals on Wild Island.  The animals have trapped the dragon and are using him to transport them back and forth across the river.  The boy uses his ingenuity to overcome obstacle after obstacle.  A charming and interesting adventure.  I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good story.  In my opinion, there is nothing offensive in this book. 
 Professors and teachers who are responsible for the instruction of pre- and inservice teachers will appreciate this excellent core text in the language foundations of reading. The author's unique background in reading science, teaching, and assessment have equipped her to provide the reader with knowledge of the language processes essential to teaching reading and spelling. Exercises are provided throughout the book and at the end of chapters that may be used to practice application of the concepts taught in the text. Professors with prior training in introductory level linguistics will be more comfortable with this text than those who do not have prior background in phonetics, phonology, grammar, morphology, and language as it relates to the teaching of reading and writing.Highly motivated teachers can use the text for self-teaching, however they would benefit from doing so in a small group of like-minded colleagues who can support each other as they work their way through the text 
 There's a profusion of books that explain the philosophy of equipment  reliability improvement, but only this totally up-to-date text will show  the reader how to specify, evaluate, buy, properly install, maintain and  upgrade critically important pumps, compressors, and other machinery.  This  third edition is almost entirely new and has nearly twice as many pages as  the earlier editions.  The guidance on turnaround planning alone is of  immense value, as are the chapters on benchmarking and life cycle costing.   Many readers will find the appendix especially helpful for determining the  life cycle cost impact of intelligent purchase and installation decisions  for centrifugal pumps 
 David Hoffman's "The Complete Illustrated Holistic Herbal" is one of those rare books I keep nearby, as I'm constantly referring to it. Developed for the layman, Holistic Herbal provides sufficient overview of various herbal remedies to allow one to get their feet wet and feel competent while doing so. Part 1 of the book is a mere 16-page overview of the holistic concept - short, but if you weren't already sold on it, you wouldn't be reading the book, would you? Part 2 covers the practical aspects of herbalism, including the collection and preparation of the various herbs. This is one the areas where the work shines through, as Hoffman's descriptions and photographic accompaniments clearly and succinctly illustrate the process of making not only infusions, tinctures and decoctions, but also capsules, lozenges and suppositories. The latter part of this section also familiarizes the reader with the technical terms associated with herbalism, from abortifacients to vulneraries, in clear layman's terms. Part 3 begins the herbal itself, and its clearly expounded sections will have you referring back to it often. Each page has one to two herbs, with a photograph of the herb in question, a description of the parts used and their preparation, dosages and possible combinations with other herbs for varied therapeutic effects. Seemingly in recognition that this information could overwhelm the layman, Hoffman outlines on page 49 a home herbal medicine chest, with around 30 basic herbs as well as the (minor) equipment one will need in order to make use of them. The therapeutic index which lists the various ailments and their herbal remedies also emphasizes several herbal remedies within each category that are particularly efficacious for the ailment in question.  
 I saw this at a film festival and laughed my ass off for 90 minutes.  It's hysterical!  What a shame that more people don't know about it.  The UCB were my favorite comedy group and they all appear in this movie in one form or another.  Also David Cross is great...I got a peek at Janeane Garofalo and Tina Fey in one scene.  Amy Poehler as Martin's stripper girlfriend is perfect.  Highly recommended if you like absurd comedy, Monty Python, etc. 
 I love this funny and musical version of the english favourite. My son loves it and can even finish the rhymes by now. Even my husband who does not speak spanish (yet!) loves repeating the simple sentences that make this book so much fun. A must in our family bed every morning, a great way to start the day 
    First Pualie Allen Puffer told everyone that they have a monstre under their bed. So now junie b  can't go to sleep. The next day Grace said that she should not had lissened to him.now her mom and dadies telling her that monster aren't real.  She said that if she goes to sleep then the monster will bite her head off. What I liked most about this book is Junie B. keep getting out of bed it was so funny. What I liked least about this book is   Junie B. is all ways screaming over everthing like if she don't get her way she will just start screaming 
 Yapko is a practitioner of what the contemporary theorists refer to as "poststructuralist thinking."  His title says it all: "Patterns" are interpretations, or constructions, of reality.  For a depressive to change her reality, all she has to do is substitute new interpretations and constructions for her old, counter-productive readings of experience.  Although Yapko tries to provide some balance, he essentially opposes biological, genetic, psychoanalytic, and even behaviorist approaches to depression.  Negative thinking isn't in your genes, your psyche, or the "external" world (though the environment influences its increasing hold on individuals): it's in you.  Consequently, Yapko reasons, you can control it if you follow his advice: stop thinking about yourself (self-consciousness leads to paralysis); avoid "global" thought (produces despair) in favor of concrete, practical thinking; forget about the past and direct your attentions to the individual's capacity to create the future.  Yapko's advice, directives, and exercises will no doubt appeal to some readers more than others.  For those who suffer from occasional "down" time, or smoldering but mild "dysthymia," the book could prove inspiriting if not inspiring.  Other readers will no doubt have a "that's easy for you to say" kind of reaction to this book.  Too frequently it can take on the reductive tone of a parent who, in denial of a child's depression, exclaims: "Stop being depressed.  It's not good for you. 
 I truly reccommend this if you are trying to learn why thing is life are not working for you 
 The amount of information on this DVD is incredible.    This is a very complete and thorough introduction to Qigong Massage.    I'm sure many people will watch this DVD and beg to differ with my calling it an introduction, as the amount of information on the DVD can occupy a viewer for years.     Prior to any information on massage, the viewer is treated to a lengthy explanation of Qigong, breathing and the various methods that can enable the viewer to carry out the numerous techniques on this video.   the introduction is very well thought out and is helpful to beginners and experienced practicioners.  Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming explains how to use your breath to switch between yin and yang and how to balance the yin and yang in your body.   Massage techniques that can bring the Qi to the extremities or send the Qi to the bones are shown and the differences explained.   The video uses extensive and professionally produced animation to demonstrate various points and techniques.    As always, the production quality of the video is up to the high standards that Dr. Yang has set over the years.  Dr. Yang presents Qigong Massage techniques for two people as well as a section on self massage.   Both sections are explained and demonstrated by Dr. Yang and an assistant.   This is not one of those simple instructional videos where you watch it once and you've got it.  This DVD can easily challenge a serious student and offers enough information to the viewer that they will be in no rush for Qigong Massage Part 2 (if there is one), as they can spend years practicing and becoming natural in their use of the techniques taught on the video.  This instructional video is for everyone, not just massage students.   Anyone practicing martial arts, sports  or just sitting around watching the boob tube can benefit from the information offered on this DVD.     
 I found the book to be very interesting. By far it is at the top of my favorites and I would give it two thumbs up. Though it is a very difficult book to comprehend for someone of a highschool status.The book is well portrayed giving us right of hand the setting and alot of the characters.This novel is a great love story and potrays one of the struggles between man and society. I found interesting the way the society of New York in the novel acted. It reflected what today's typical groups would be like. In my case, I know of groups that have someone that is judged, someone who judges, and someone on top of fashion, as in the book. There were instances in which I found Ellen to appear like one of my acquaintances. Though later finding out they were very different. Ellen is a well developed character, the standout of the crowd, the care free person. Anyone could fall in love with her as  Archer does.The book challenged my way of thought, at one point I believed that Archer was going to relieve his commitment with May to go with Ellen. I was proved wrong as I read on. It turns out that after Archer confesses his love to Ellen, and doesn't have the chance to relieve himself from May. He is late to find out the news of his wives pregnancy. Ellen knowing this leaves for Europe ending with any hope Archer may have had. That's not the end, since after twenty-five years Archer has three children and May has died from pneumonia . Now his son has convinced him to go look for Ellen. At this point I wanted to see them get back together, but was shocked to find out that Archer didn't want to. Instead he preffered to live with his memories of her. It was a great book, but I recommend it to college level readers because of the context. Overall, it was a great love story and it kept me very interested from beginning to end 
 It had been way too long since I picked up a Heinlein title: "Stranger in a Strange Land" being the last time I ventured into his densely written world 15 years ago.  The book touts that this is "Science Fiction's most controversial novel"...and I can see that since it was written in 1964.  However, the disturbing elements of slavery, incest, and cannibalism cetainlty transcend time.  As for the storyline, it is inetersting and well put together.  This book seemed to me like two stories in one.  The first half could be entitled "The Survivalist Guide After the Complete Destruction of the World as We Know It" and I shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the (un)liklihood I ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods.    The story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future Earth.  The "color war" has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves.  This new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works.  Our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities.  I do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about Farnham's clan.  It is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world: leaders, fighters, followers, cowards, dependants, etc.  The strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot (even learn to like it).    The time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title "sci-fi".  Other than that, it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction.  If you can muddle through the first half of the book, dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin, you're in for a good read.  This book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more.  
 I own this album and it is by far one of my favorites in my collection.  The duet "Without You" with Clay Aiken is phenomenal.  Every song is beautifully sung and radio friendly.  I only hope she does more in the future 
 Allowing you to pull one napkin at a time without disturbing the others.  It's sleak stainless steel design looks great in my stainless kitchen 
 There are so many great ideas in this book I can't wait to try! I just got this book and already made the Rocky Road brownies since their so easy. Everyone loved them (and no one could tell it was from a mix either). I brought them to a dinner and there are lots of other ideas for Bake-and-Take cakes that will be perfect to bring to the office or to other friends. What I really like about this book is all the photos as well as the easy instructions 
 I consider myself well schooled in low budget schlock from various film genres. Watching cheesy films is an acquired taste, one not easily cultivated overnight. Even with some knowledge about who makes these types of films under my belt, I still stumble over major contributors to the clunker movie catalogue and wonder why I haven't spent time with these delicacies before now. Roger Corman is my latest discovery. I admit I have heard of Corman before in reference to the spate of Vincent Price horror classics that emerged in the 1960s, along with a few other films he made over the course of his career, but until now I never saw many of them. This guy is a giant of the low budget film, producing or directing some 500 plus movies in the last forty years. He's still going strong as far as I know, and never limits his output to one particular genre; he's made westerns, horror, action, drama, and science fiction films with seeming ease. Moreover, according to the bio on this DVD, Corman helped launch the careers of numerous Hollywood bigwigs. If "Big Bad Mama" is any indication, I will continue to spend a lot of time with this filmmaker's projects in the near future.  "Big Bad Mama" is a sort of feminist reinterpretation of those movies about Depression era highway outlaws; it's "Bonny and Clyde" with lipstick and long tresses. Angie Dickinson plays Wilma McClatchie, a mule headed, dirt poor Texas woman with a temper and a desire to better her conditions. Life hasn't been easy for Wilma, not with two young daughters to raise in a ramshackle cabin out in the sticks. What's a woman to do during these tough times? Why, strike up a relationship with local bootlegger Barney (Noble Willingham), of course! But when the wedding ceremony of one of Wilma's daughters goes horribly awry, and Barney perishes in a shootout, Wilma is left holding several unpleasant bags. The Feds involved in bringing down Barney, led by Bonney (Richard Smith), now set their sights on Wilma and her kids. Unfortunately, McClatchie plays right into their hands by taking over Barney's illicit liquor operation. At some point, Wilma decides she's had enough of being poor and decides to hit the road in search of ill-gotten gains. She takes her two lascivious daughters, Polly (Robbie Lee) and Billy Jean (Susan Sennett), along for the ride. And why not? If you're going to embark on a crime spree, you may as well make it a family affair.  Problem is, Wilma cannot escape the lure of sleazy, good for nothing men. She first hooks up with wanted criminal Fred Diller (Tom Skerritt), and quickly consummates their partnership the old fashioned way. Then conman extraordinaire William Baxter (William Shatner) enters the picture, and Wilma brings him into the fold as well. The resulting jealousy between Diller and Baxter, along with a most unusual relationship struck up between Diller and Wilma's daughters, will certainly lead to dangerous tensions within the gang. Despite these internal stresses, Wilma continues to plot the next big score. The gang finally stumbles upon the perfect scheme; they will infiltrate a soiree thrown by a bunch of rich folks and kidnap one of them. McClatchie and her compatriots succeed in abducting Jane Kingston (Joan Prather), but the plan fouls up when Diller decides to get up close and personal with the hapless heiress. Then Baxter pulls a fast one. Then the cops and the G-men close in. Cue gunfire and crashing cars. Roll credits. Who will live and who will perish? Surprisingly, you'll actually care about the answer to that question while watching "Big Bad Mama."  I've seen several Corman classics now, and "Big Bad Mama" ranks as one of the better ones. First, you've got a solid cast filling all the main roles. Dickinson not only looks fantastic, but she believably portrays a poor woman looking out for her own with nothing to lose. Tom Skerritt, an actor I've never liked in anything, actually manages to avoid annoying me as the murderous and jealous Fred Diller. As for Shatner, well, he's probably at his most restrained here in a role requiring him to talk softly in oily tones. I got a kick out of the daughters. Both of them are so far over the top that you can't help but laugh at their antics. Be sure and keep an eye open for their dancing routine at the local veteran's get together. Is anyone as dense as these two airheads? Guess so. Thankfully, the performances unfold against the second important element that makes "Big Bad Mama" a lot of fun, namely the film's great atmosphere. While I imagine plenty of anachronisms plague the movie, I thought the 1930s props looked way better than I expected to see in a low budget picture. Finally, you really do get an opportunity to see Angie Dickinson take a few risks, so to speak, but you'll miss it if you blink. Considering what the actress had to do in the role, I'm surprised she took the part when she was still a player in Hollywood.   The DVD is standard a standard Roger Corman release. You get the obligatory short interview with Leonard Maltin, and a bunch of trailers. A sequel to "Big Bad Mama," unoriginally entitled "Big Bad Mama II," came out roughly ten years later. While I haven't seen the sequel, which apparently once again stars Angie Dickinson, I can say that the first film is a lot of fun. Great performances, bountiful skin, a sleazy attitude, and wonderfully realistic atmosphere makes this Corman classic a must see for B movie fans.         
 Vladimir Horowitz's April 20, 1986 Moscow recital has become so legendary that further comment seems superfluous.    To say that this concert was an emotional experience is understatement.  A lesser pianist might have wilted under the pressure, and many expected Horowitz would cancel. (He nearly did, after learning Vladimir Feltsman's piano had been vandalized following a concert at the American embassy.  It took a phone call from President Reagan to persuade him to continue with the trip.)  At 82, Horowitz seems ecstatically inspired here.  He is in finer form here than he was in his 1985 recitals, where he occasionally sounded rusty.  In the more bravura pieces, he uses a full dynamic range, which he mostly avoided at this time.  Some of the performances, particularly the Liszt Sonetto, recall the fiery Horowitz of the 1940s.  Yet, there is a balance and inner warmth that was largely missing in his earlier years.  Certainly, the young Horowitz would not have delivered the sprightly, bouncy Scarlatti Sonata (superior to performances from 1951 and 1968), or the charming Mozart Sonata (far preferable to the drab version taped in his living room one year earlier).  But it's with the Russian repertoire that Horowitz hits his stride, from Rachmaninoff's sunny G major Prelude to Scriabin's stormy D-sharp minor Etude - - where the bass notes ring as resoundingly as the bells of the Kremlin.  The Chopin Mazurkas are offered with the bewitching melancholy that caused a German critic to rave over Horowitz ("Piano Culture Reawakened", read the 1926 headline).  If the sparks of Moszkowski's Etincelles don't flicker as incandescently as they did in earlier days, Schumann's Traumerei sings with a new and heartfelt simplicity.       For the record, not all of the performances on this CD come from the actual recital. The Scarlatti Sonata, first movement from the Mozart Sonata, Rachmaninoff G major Prelude and Polka, and Schubert-Liszt Soires de Vienne came from the public rehearsal two days before the concert.  However, no intersplicing was done within movements, so this is really how Horowitz played at that time.   The sound is excellent, if a bit close.  I heard Horowitz in concert in Boston this same year - - this is how he sounded. 
 I teach leadership and this book has been on my required list since 1990. It is short, instructive and not easily replaced by others. It handles the subject broadly and with a great anticipation for this decades insights  about effective leadership. The use of survey material, while a little  flawed in terms of sampling (not all great leadership takes place at the  top) gives us very helpful data to validate some unusual conclusions about  leadership 
 This is the first time I had heard Luiz Bonfa's playing, although his name was mentioned in Castro's book on the history of Bossa Nova. Every song on this CD is absolutely amazing. Even though many songs are less than 5 minutes long, they pack so much feeling in them. Luiz' voice is also a real pleasure to listen to 
      A great teacher of Christian prayer has described to me personally that "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" is a "classic". Shunryu Suzuki would best describe his book as "nothing special".       I never thought that this book would impact me as it has, but a combination of Jesus' own teaching on prayer("Metanoiesete, for the Kingdom of God is within you"[Lk.17:21]); Saint Thomas Aquinas' ultimate confession:"Because we are not capable of knowing WHAT GOD IS but only what God is not...this is the ultimate in human knowledge of God: TO KNOW THAT WE DO NOT KNOW HIM"[Questiones Disputate de Potentia Dei,7,5 ad 14]; and Suzuki's conclusion "I discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in NO THING."(p.116) has brought me to the conclusion that EAST/WEST dialogue on contemplative prayer is the key to the future of Christianity and all other world religions in these desperate times.       This book teaches prayer with the understanding that the only time we have is "NOW", and the only directive is "Don't think about it, don't write about it, do it! Now!       Zazen/Christian prayer can be done 24/7/365 anywhere, in any situation, and when it is, it is "ordinary", "interior" and "nothing special".        
 This work is considered one of Balzac's masterpieces. It is written with this kind of energy and power the same kind of literary ambition that seems uniquely his. Balzac as a writer has a drive and strength , and this is felt in his descriptions of character as well as in the force of his plots. Here we have a variation of Lear, with two ungrateful daughters doing - in the over- solicitous father for whom the daughters are all. One of Balzac's central themes is obsession, the fixing on one particular object as one's life aim or meaning and giving all to it. For old Goriot it is his daughters, as for Balzac himself it is his ambition to capture the whole of his society in his novels. But the Balzac worlds and this in itself another long subject are also worlds in which traditional values are in clash with values of social climbing money grabbers as exemplified by Goriot's daughters. Balzac's works are filled with great dynamism  and are for many one of the great peaks of world - literature. At least some of his works should be read by one who wishes to have a taste of the best that has been thought and said. I would only add my own personal reservation. That the energy and greed of so many of the characters in his world , has left me feeling a bit detached from them. I can admire this Literature but I have never especially loved the world or characters presented in it. 
 Ive read this book in one of my classes at school.  I would suggest it to anyone that has a wider vocabulary.  Basically its about a man, the narrator, who has an obsession with another man's eye.  The eye resembles that of a vulture's or in simpler terms it has a glazed look to it.  The eye drives the narrator crazy. After many nights of waiting he finally gets the chance to kill him.  He hides the body underneath the floorboards in the house.  When the police investigate the narrator believes that he can hear the beating of the heart underneath the floor.  He is sure the police can hear it to.  It ocercomes him, and since he is so sure that they hear it, he confesses.  When in all reality, it is his own guilt which leads him to confess... But thats a reader's digest version.  : 
 This book was recommended by someone on a Border Collie list I frequent. Suzanne Clothier is not your ordinary trainer. How do I know that? I had a purebred German Shepherd who went through two different dog schools" and I still didn't know how to handle him. Granted, this was 30 years ago, but reading Clothier's book, not much may have changed.  I was fascinated by her gentle and understanding approach. While I wished for more personal dog stories, the end of the book more than made up for it. I cried for an hour.  The best I can say for Clothier is that she thinks like a dog -- coming from a dog lover, that's the best compliment this two-footer can give her 
 Vittorio De Sica's highly acclaimed film "Bicycle Thieves" (called for years, in America, "The Bicycle Thief") is now presented in a superb transfer by The Criterion Collection. The film was released in 1949 and won a special Academy Award (the Best Foreign Film category didn't exist yet) and has lived on in "Great Movie" books and Top Movies of All Time Lists. Astoundingly, due to all its accolades, is a very simple film. It was made during the times of Italian neo-realism and many of the actors in the film aren't professional actors, including the lead role of Antonio (played by Lamberto Maggiorani). The setting is Rome, where jobs are scarce and many of the people live in poverty. Antonio's luck changes for the better when he finally gets a job hanging posters of Rita Hayworth up around town. Problem is, he needs a bicycle. He tells the man who gives him the job that he has one, but the truth is; he just pawned it to get food for his wife and two children. In order to retrieve his bike, his wife sells their bedsheets, and Antonio sets off to make some money. Then, suddenly, his bicycle his stolen and his whole world comes crashing down. Unable to do his job, he notifies the police who tell him that they can do nothing about it. So, he begins walking the streets of Rome with his son trying to find it. That's pretty much it; But the movie, in all of its simplicity, is so much more poetic and important. Despite not being a professional actor, Maggiorani gives one of the most memorable performances I've ever seen. Even the boy who plays his young son is unforgettable. The movie is filled with great scenes, such as the moment where Antonio spots the man who stole his bicycle and attempts to get it back, only to have the entire neighborhood gang up on him. Then there are the final scenes, where we realize that the actual title of the film "Bicycle Thieves" is much more appropriate than "The Bicycle Thief." To say "Bicycle Thieves" is a masterpiece would be an understatement. Many movies can be called masterpieces, but few films really embody the wonder of cinema. This movie is important, well made on all levels, it has aged well, and it's entertaining. We know that the latter doesn't always happen in "great movies." Anyone who wants to begin watching films that have shaped cinema over the course of the years can start anywhere from 'Citizen Kane' to 'Breathless' to 'Jules and Jim' to 'Pulp Fiction.' Those films are all good to start with, but at some point you must see "Bicycle Thieves."  GRADE:  
 A&E's Truman Capote bio is head and sholders above the Great Writer's bio. A&E uses rare footage, new reasearch, and exclusive videos to bring the experience to life. The only problem is its just too short at only 50 minutes. As it is, it won't lose your interest, and touches all the important bases. See why Truman Capote is also known as "the tiny terror" 
 Having read much of Steinbeck's work, I feel that this book ranks high on his list of fine literature.  This book is structured similarly to "Tortilla Flat" in that it is about a group of blue collar men being inept and drinking.  "Cannery Row" differs in that the plot is more engaging and the language is much more coarse than "Tortilla Flat".  The book opens with the transfer of ownership of a troublesome vacant lot in Cannery Row.  This land attracts the residence of the group of misfits that occupy much of the plot.  While meaning well, Mack, Hazel, and the rest of the gang routinely see their plans fall to pieces.  Even when they attempt to throw a party for the much adored Doc, it only creates mayhem in the Doc's life.  It is from these failures in their attempts to please Doc that the plot of throwing a proper party for Doc evolves.  Thus a background develops for which the characters to change.  Many readers would object to a plot that seems as thin as the one in "Cannery Row".  In reality, the book is more about the characters and their growth than the plot.  Perhaps more so than any other writer, Steinbeck knows how to write a portrait of a man 
 If you've enjoyed the works of CS Lewis, it would follow that Tozer's, Pursuit of God will leave you with a similar WOW.  Pursuit of God is an "A-list" read for those with that curiously voracious need to better understand God. 
 Right after reading this book just once, my daughter was outside telling me all the different things the clouds looked like! This book really stimulates the imagination. The simple pictures and verse make it a great bed-time book for the little ones. It has quickly become one of my daughter's "must-have" going to bed books 
 Jo Portillo's personal planning book was great.  The book included everything you need to know about personal planning and more.  It was easy to follow and most helpful.  It made planning a personal career path much  simplier 
 I sometimes wonder about the mentality of geek scriptwriters in Hollywood. It seems like one of these nerds thought"Let's make a movie about lotsa cars being stolen. This is because the cars thief's brother is in trouble". Well that's about the entire plot of this movie. Cars get stolen but no pedestrians are killed which would have made this movie "rawther sordid" I do believe. Once again Hollywood has made a movie which glorifies Criminal Activity.Angelina looks good  as always but even she can't save this turkey of a movie.If you have seen one Hollywood car chase then you have seen them all 
 If you read one murder novel in the rest of your life, read "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It's only 500 pages but it speaks volumes.  I discovered Dostoyevsky a few months ago while I was deployed to Iraq and my literary world will never been the same.  I found a copy of "The Brothers Karamazov" in a pile of miscellenious books that had been dedicated to troops to boost morale and took it to a literary savvy Lt. Col. I knew. When I showed him my find, he insisted I read Crime and Punishment first. I'm certainly glad I decided to take his advice.    Crime and Punishment tells the story of a brutal murder in pre- revolutionary Russa and the emotional torment of the eccentric murderer, Raskolnikov. The book is as dark and suspenseful as anything I've ever read, but it also manages to convey things on the opposite end of the emotional spectrum like redemption and love. My favorite passage of the book (a hard pick, for sure) is when Porfiry, a jovial but formitable detective, interrogates Raskolnikov.   The deployment is over, but my infatuation with Dostoyevsky's books has just begun. I'm now reading "The Idiot" and enjoying it, though it's too early to see if it matches "Crime and Punishment."   Whether you are deployed to the farthest reaches of the world or sitting comfortably at home, "Crime and Punishment" promises to be an exhilerating read.     
 I like this book, its easy to read it...  Good documen 
 This is a great musical for kids and grownups alike. This version is vastly superior to the Disney production. The charming melodies by Mark Charlap and Julie Styne with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh are delightfully performed by the entire cast. I was especially pleased to see that this performance maintained the integrity of the original score and was not sanitized for political correctness. My 5 year old son has seen three live performances of this show and watches this DVD often. He wants to be Peter Pan for Halloween (Just as Captain Hook laments in one scene.) 
 For any fan of Dean Martin, this Cd is must. Every song brings back to a time when music was great and had meaning 
 this is music....best of all jagged album 
 This is one of the earlier books by the late John Walvoord. During the early years of his tenure at Dallas Theological Seminary, arguments within the conservative theological community were fierce and serious. It is important to bear in mind that Walvoord is writing with a two-fold purpose. One was to explain the premillennial view of scripture, based on a literal hermeneutic. The other was to answer the arguments put forth by amillennial theologians of the day against the view. One of the chief combatants in that fight was the Presbyterian theologian Oswald T. Allis, and his book 'Prophecy and the Church'. Thus it is good to keep in mind that throughout church history, doctrinal disputes have been waged between theologians in this fashion. Thus whether is is Luther and Eck, or Walvoord and Allis, this is not unusual or strange. Moreover, Walvoord carries out his arguments with the utmost charity -  he never attacks ad hominum, or in any way impugns the character of his opponents. Walvoord is a careful exegete, and presents his case in an orderly and dispassionate manner. This book I have found to be one of the best expositions of dispensational theology that is available today. Finally, for those who think questions of premillennial/amillennial are simply prophetic disputes, this book illustrates well how this is a package deal; it affects the entire Christian life. For this reason alone, the book should be read 
 I absolutely love this magazine! This is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries! The magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones. A wonderful magazine 
 I'm currently reading Gulliver's Travels for my English class, and i have to say, what a very interesting book. I wasn't a huge fan of classic books, but this book so far has surprised me. I like how the author wrote the book to where you just can't put the book down. Sadly though, some parts can be quite boring, but the author is able to change that, and make it interesting again.So if anyone is reading my review, so get a copy of this book immediately, or else you will be missing out on something very interesting.  
 When I ordered the item I wasn't given any expected date of arrival or any option on shipping speed.  I had 10 days to get the item before the event - and it arrived well after date needed.  I realize this is an outside vendor, but usually Amazon items come quite quickly. Thanks, Debbi 
 Cape Refuge by Terri Blackstock is the first in the self-titled series.  Blackstock is a wonderful Christian suspense author, and I'm currently working my way through all of her writings.  (Books 2-4 in the series are in the very tall stack of books by my bed) Sometimes the stories can be a bit formulaic, but her message of salvation makes her work rise above the rest.  Morgan and Blair Owens are devastated by the brutal murders of their parents and determined to find the killer.  When Morgan's husband, Jonathan, is arrested for the murders, the women have to overcome their differences and work together to save not only Jonathan, but the legacy their parents had created in the town.  If you like Tami Hoag or Julie Garwood's contemporary thrillers, you'll definitely enjoy Terri Blackstock.  My one complaint is Blair.  For someone whose life is in danger, she certainly takes a lot of lonely walks.  I was ready to shake her by the end of the book, and I hope that her character becomes more sympathetic in the second book. 
 This book should be required reading for all jounalism college majors who intend to "tell the whole truth." If the present doesn't reveal the truth then history will. Ms. Lipstadt did an incredible job of researching and tying together huge numbers of old newspaper articles and putting them together to tell the whole story chonologically and coherently.  She showed the hypocricy of the press in calling for "something" to be done (after they could no longer deny atrocities were happening) then fomenting opposition to allowing anymore refugees into this country.  They could have cited, "there are almost half a million immigration visas available, bring them in." She also shows the hypocricy of the British press who also called for "something" to be done, then when the war was over and surviving Jews were trying to get into British Mandate Palestine, there was no cry from the press, "We didn't do anything then, but now we should not hinder them in immigrating to their homeland."  Of all nations, the Brits are the most culpable because they had control over The Land, and instead of allowing walking miracles to start new lives, they hindered them with all their might,preventing surviving Jews from coming in before and during the war, then sending them to Cyprus after the war; shooting them down as they tried to swim ashore after their ships had been fired upon sunk, and the French sent those survivors on "The Exodus," back to camps in Germany.  With every cell in my body I want to cry out, "How could you??" Thank you, Ms. Lipstadt for gathering painful information and putting it into such a gripping account 
 Gene Edwards mixes bible text and his own interpretation to give you an exciting and visionary view of the birth of Christ. I found it excited me to read all his other works A great book for Xmas 
 If there were ever a "desert island book," Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is it. His story-telling ability is without parallel, and his poetry is magnificent, even better than Shakespeare, which, of course, is not a completely fair comparison, since Middle English is a more musical language than Modern English. Compare, for example, the sound of Italian to the sound of modern English, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Check out, for starters, the Pardoner's Prologue and Tale (the basis for Bogart's Treasure of the Sierra Madre), the Nun's Priest's Tale, and the incomparable Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale. Chaucer's Tales cover a wide tonal range, from hilarious farce, to mock-heroic, satirical, bawdy, to horrific, autobiographical, to High Chivalric and so on. Together they form a literary encyclopedia of Medieval life, history, and culture.   Amazon rather confusingly lumps together all the Canterbury Tales reviews for translations, partial editions, and etc. The Everyman's library edition is NOT a translation, and includes ALL the tales. It's worthwhile reading Chaucer in the original Middle English, despite the difficulty for a modern reader, because of the beauty of the poetry, which can't be translated. The Everyman's edition is the easiest to use, as all the footnotes and glosses are complete and easily accessible on the same page with the text, not in back as with other editions. This edition is hardbound yet affordable and will last several lifetimes 
 I was cleaning out my old tapes and came across this gem! Listening to it again brought back memories of such happy times. I bought the cassette after hearing this dynamic trio's first single 'Come Go With Me'.    The second single that stood out to me is the outstanding 'Let Me Be The One' with Goia's lead.  I agree with a previous poster that she was absolutely the "Beyonce" of the group while the more pop-oriented voice of Jeanette (my "Diana Ross" of the group) dominated the group's initial releases.  I'm also very happy to hear that the Goia has recovered from the medical problem she suffered and continues to have a successful singing career - it would've been one hell of a shame for a voice like hers to be silenced.  This entire disc is some of the most enjoyable, fun music I've ever heard (even the ballads cause me to swing & sway a little). If you enjoy late '80's Miami dance sounds mixed with dance/pop grooves, you should take a chance and sample this disc.  My fave tracks:  Come Go With Me   Let Me Be The One       Exposed To Love        Seasons Change       Extra Extra   Point Of No Return   December   
 I'm updating my review for this DVD. The Amazon people have it wrong, this DVD IS NOT coded Region 2, IT IS CODED REGION 0 ( WORLDWIDE ), so it will play on any DVD player in the world. I went to my local Borders Store the other day to investigate. I found this DVD and sure enough it had the proper codes. I bought it and it works perfectly in my Region 1, North American DVD player, so it should obviously work for you too. Seriously, Amazon should be more careful about their listing to make sure they don't put in the wrong information!  This DVD is great and a total delight for fans of Herbert von Karajan and fans of conducting or music in general. Karajan is filmed doing a very thorough rehearsal of Schumann's 4th Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic, then you get a full performance of this Symphony. Karajan's performances of Schumann were always notable, this is another exceptional account of this Romantic score.  The second half of this DVD program focuses on Beethoven's 5th with the Berlin Philharmonic. We are initially given a brief interview with Karajan as he sits at a piano, after that there is an extended sequence where Karajan tutors a young conducting student through some basic material in the second movement of the Symphony. Following this tutorial demonstration, we are given a full performance of the 5th, a very hot-blooded, typically dramatic interpretation from Karajan.   The wonder of these filmed rehearsals and performances is the casual, charismatic nature of Karajan and the way everything is filmed is exceptional. The director is the famous French filmmaker, Henri-Georges Clouzot, director of classic films "Wages of Fear" and "Diabolique", among others. Clouzot brings his wonderful, involved filming style to these Karajan rehearsals and performances. The black and white cinematography is very beautiful and the editing is perfect, just goes hand in hand with the amazing music making. All the instrumentalists get the chance to show off their skills onscreen and there are plenty of wide angle shots to showcase the entire orchestra. The way the camera moves and glides with the music is a testament to Clouzot and what a master of his craft he was, just like the conductor was of his. Karajan is the star obviously but he is not unduly concentrated upon to the detriment of the musicians. Clouzot's filming style is practically perfect. If you are a fan of Karajan or conducting, this is a must own DVD because it gives you another perspective on Karajan, the fact that he wasn't just some egomaniac but instead a truly gifted communicator, a musician completely at the service of the great art of music 
 I absolutely adore this book especially the extra chapters at the back. For  those of us that didn't have grandma around to help pass on those favorites.This is THE book 
 Whew!  All these negative reviews.  What's up with that?  This book was awesome.  Two cute teen boys, a gathering relationship, warm-your-heart sex, a GREAT ending and then a SEQUEL.  The storyline took a while to develop but I wasn't disappointed at all.  Why were so many others who've read the story dissing it?  I can't really explain why.  The characters were well developed with a lot of detail.  In fact, it was almost like I was watching a movie unfold because the characters and the plot were so well detailed.  I read other reviews that stated that they didn't like reading about the sex in this story.  Duh.  They're teens.  They're gay.  It's all very new to them.  But that was just the spice!  The real point of the novel was the relationship.  So, Mr. Kendrick, I got it.  Thanks for a wonderful story about boys who fall in love - and it sounds like for keeps, too 
 My daughter just brought this book home from the kingergarten library.  I read it to my three children and cried the entire latter half of the story.  I'm relieved to read in the other reviews that I'm not the only one arrested by the beauty of this story and thrown into tears!  The sweet simplicity of the relationship between the grandfather and his granddaughter reminded me of my grandparents, and of my parents' grandparenting with my little children.    I am ordering this book from Amazon right this minute.  I want it to have a permanent place in my children's home library 
 I finally gave my self the mental courage to explore some of the issues about The Smiths I was reluctant to divuldge myself into.  Quite aware of the greed, the egos, and other self inflicted issues that caused the break up of my most passionate feelings towards my life and music -- I came to terms.  Within 72 hours, the book was complete and left me conjureing with my own thoughts of life, death, and everything in between -- which is rather ongoing.  As for the few that are out there, they will understand and comprehend what Morrissey, Marr and The Smiths mean in terms of living.  I for one, held onto their myth which is the reason that I am still amongst the world.  I applaude Rogan for the time he spent capturing Manchester -  while I was a 'country mile behind the world' and state bound if that 
 This book covers thirty-two of the world's best-known artists pictures for children to learn the basics about art. The artists lives are explained which helps youngsters understand the artists works. The information is presented so as to stimulate young artists to explore their own artistic abilities. Many different styles are represented with brief explanations of what a particular style was like, however the adult, teacher or parent might have to further explain certain concepts with more clarity by using other visual examples. There is, however, a helpful glossary. The accompanying biographies for each artist is very brief with even more selective facts regarding their lives. Artists include Van   Gogh, Gauguin, Picasso, Monet, Degas, Turner, Friedrich, Goya, Botticelli, Vermeer, Michaelangelo, Van Eyck, Magritte, Warhol, Matisse and O'Keefe amongst others. Curiously enough not one of the great artists Mexico has produced is mentioned or profiled. The book also covers basic information about the actual process and the materials used. This is a good book for the elementary school student or for parents to buy to share the reading experience with prior to them attending school. The paintings are well displayed and the internet links are helpful for the curious student. A good book for all young readers 
 This book was in great shape and is an excellent read for those who want to understand 
 It is fitting that this audio adaptation of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was voiced by actor Stephen Fry.  Fry was a close friend of the late Mr. Adams, and he also narrates the new H2G2 movie as the voice of the Book.  Fry does a great job of making this classic novel come alive, drawing the listener into the story.  This audiobook makes a great tribute to Douglas Adams and the world and characters he created in the H2G2 universe 
 The Russia House is one of Sean Connery's last really good performances before he realized that they'd still pay him the big bucks even if he was just sleepwalking through a part and refusing to do more than one take. It's also one of the best screen adaptations of a John Le Carre novel, a surprisingly ambitious screenplay by Tom Stoppard that folds chronology, character and plot points in on themselves like origami in the opening and closing scenes making for engaging and occasionally playful viewing. The excellent supporting cast, including an exceptionally good Michelle Pfeiffer, don't hurt either. Only the last minute studio-imposed happy ending grates, but not enough to do any real damage. Jerry Goldsmith provides a fine score, the love theme proving third time lucky after it was dropped from both Wall Street and Alien Nation.  
 I found this book in a used book store and bought it not knowing anything about the book or its author.  I'm glad I bought it and read it.  It was a wonderful insight into human hearts 
 This book is a wonderful resourse for anyone visiting, touring, or considering re-locating to Montana. It is conveniently divided into geographic sections and provides lodging, restaurants, attractions, hiking trails, campsites, weather, driving distance, you name it...it's in this book. There are photos of almost every place mentioned. It's a real must for anyone taking a leisurly tour of Montana. I highly recommend this atlas 
 well i've played this for a few hours since it just came yesterday but i'm already very impressed. the graphics are incredible, i didn't think the ds was capable of such pretty 3-d with zoom graphics.  there are 23 different job classes in the game (ex. white wizard, knight, sage, etc.), which fans of final fantasy tactics will recognize. being able to shift jobs and work towards more powerful ones melds the best of rpg and tactics. in other words, crazy awesome good.  will probably be the handheld game of the year, and will probably be the biggest rpg of the christmas season. **** 
 As someone who grew up in a small town and then moved to a big city, I found this movie both very well made and at the same time almost intolerably unnerving. The direction and writing really captures with clear precision the setting and characters. This film is almost a documentary of life in a small rural town with its uneasy awkwardness and tense unhappiness that seems to underly everything. Each member of the family is almost like a mirror to members of my family or people I knew in my small town. The use of silence and long still shots of empty rooms helped flush out the mood of small town life. This is definitely a character piece, but the plot was kept at a good pace and Amy Adams' portrayal of Ashley was magnificent. Lots of visual metaphors and subtle reinforcements of the larger emotions throughout. For example, the story arc of Madeleine and Wark was such an interesting counter arc to Madeleine's initiation into the Johnsten family. A smaller, but nice touch, was the painting of Madeleine's nails, which stayed red until they were back on the highway and leaving it all  behind. As I said, this film made me crawl in my skin it was so realistic, but it was an excellent watch 
 This book has lists I didn't even think of. Ever have trouble remembering an example of an impressionist artist who did landscapes? This book has a whole list of them. Need to know of activities that can be done with clay, or different types of glue? This book has sections on those also. This book is a must have for future art teachers or those of you who just like to spend time using the right side of your brain 
 I agree with almost everything said in the other 5 star reviews, so I will not repeat it.  There is one thing that I think needs to be stressed further, and that is that even though the first peice is very long, it does pay off to listen to it all the way through.  At the end, you'll exclaim, wow, that was amazing, i can't wait to listen to it again.  So my advice to you is, start listening 
 It may not compare to his others but all his others are classics. This is considered a great album. There is alot of good songs on here 
 I bought "The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire" by Edward Gibbon and "Patriots The Men Who Started The American Revolution" by A. J. Langguth because they were "important" books and  because I thought that while they wouldn't necessarily be "good reads" they would be "good for me."  Both books languished on the book shelf awaiting a long trip, a bout with the flu or some other occasion when time would weight heavily on my hands.  Time passed and finally when I was almost brain dead from reading less than sterling commercial fiction I, with some hesitation about a book with 563 pages, picked up "Patriots.  I shouldn't have lingered in picking it up or hesitated about reading it.  "Patriots" is a sensational book, a great read and a definite page turner.  While the book is of course historical, and apparently well researched, fact it reads like contemporary best selling fiction. Think Mario Puzo and "The Godfather" and Dan Brown and "The Da Vinci Code" for starters.  I let favorite TV programs go unwatched while I read. I read at night. I read in the morning. When I finished the last page I was bereft. I wanted volumes 2. 3, 4. 5 and even 6.  The pages sing as Washington, Jefferson, Hancock, Revere, Arnold, John and Samuel Adams, King George III, William Pitt and generals, soldiers, statesmen, wives, husbands, lovers, farmers and everyday citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and on the issue of American independence, come to life with all of their human frailties, foibles, accomplishments and disasters.  A. J. Langguth is a brilliant writer and "Patriots" should be required reading for anyone with the slightest interest in history or for anyone who loves a good book.           
 This book was our 3rd grader's homeschool reading assignment.  He is a reluctant reader, so it took him a while to finish it.  The vocabulary is slightly difficult for a 9 or 10 year old, but daily discussions about what your student has read helps keep the story interesting and motivates them to read further.  HOMESCHOOLERS: READ MY OTHER REVIEWS 
 While not the best in the series, a big improvement over "J" is for Judgement (the weakest in the series, so far). Did Sue Grafton actually write that one??? "K" is for Killer brings back the Kinsey Millhone of the earlier books. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ending, but overall a good read. Looking forward to reading "L" is for Lawless now 
 This book was a really good book. Its really easy to connect to it. I think anyone that reads this book is going to like it. Especially young teenagers. I don`t really like reading and when i saw the title i didn`t expect the book to be any good but then i started to read it and i couldn't put it down. Its really a great book 
 This is an undeniably beautifully written book and wonderful story, but was a little less of a personal favorite than was the first book of this Border Trilogy. McCarthy dropped a bit of the power and simplicity of language of "All The Pretty Horses" and instead became much more wordy and allegorical. I appreciated the straight-ahead story of the first book that also managed to project a lasting emotion at the same time. In The Crossing, the language was as beautiful, but there were often stories and sub-plots that stalled out the otherwise fast and engaging book. These asides seemed to have been added to build depth in the characters, but for me weakened the story 
 Book Proposals that Sell is packed full of information that new authors need to know. I use this book for personal reference as well as a resource when I teach writing classes. Terry Whalin's years of experience pour from its pages. If you can buy only one book on the subject of proposals -- this is the one you want 
 This book was recommended to me while I was engaged to my wife.  It is an awsome book.  Mr. Trobisch cast a very clear and poignant perspective to the relationship of marriage.  A perspective only God could give.  This book should be required reading for all high school and college students who have thoughts, questions, or ideas about marriage and also required for all of us who are now married.  I plan on having this classic in my household for all of my children to read 
 Brian Wilson finally released his first solo album, and it is GREAT! Every song is special in its own way. This album is very emotionally moving and beautifully crafted. The bonus tracks are more than equal to the album itself. Night Blooming Jasmine and Being With The One You Love are really pleasant to listen to. Anyone who enjoys the Beach Boys' music unconditionally will love this album. Listen to it with an open heart, and be transformed 
 To me, anyone writing poetry should have three books in their library... "If You Want To Write" by Brenda Ueland, "Break Blow Burn" by Camille Paglia, and this one... "Poemcrazy" by Susan G. Wooldridge... Poemcrazy is a rare find, I've decided, among books on writing and reading poetry - it is a book that offers a positive outlook on writing poems... the ingredients for poems are everywhere, all around us, in the simplest things of our lives, histories and daily experiences... and Poemcrazy is a great book to inspire you to find these things and learn from them and grow as a writer... it's a very simple book to read, the chapters are short but have a good impact... I really am glad to have stumbled across this book by chance 
 I actually teared up at the end of this book, not something I expected from a book about ethnobotany.  At the end of the reading I had learned about the lives of researchers in such exquisit detail that I lived along side of them.  This book is nearly perfect, much better than even the rave recommendation from some very respected friends.  It's possible that there will never be anyone who will have the knowledge from experience that Richard Shultes had aquired in South America and that alone makes this book very rich, yet added to his story are the experiences of Davis and Dr. Plowman two researchers that also immerse themselves deeply into the Andes, the llanos, and the Amazon to learn about the forests, the people and the use of medicinal and psychoactive plants.   This is a long book, nearly 500 pages and is a serious commitment but well worth it as you will not experience anything quite like it unless Davis's other book is better (I have not read it yet).  I only have a few complaints about the book and those are regarding omissions in some available photographs that Davis mentions in the end and a lack of maps for much of the area covered in the book. There is one small map on page 125 that shows the route of travels but it is too small and difficult to use.  I resorted to a copy of International Travel Maps - South America North West to see the detail that I needed as I followed the travels of Schutes, Davis and Plowman.  Davis is an excellent writer and he has a way of conveying a sensitivity to the lives of all that he encounters.  That along with his insight into the cultures that he experiences and the knowledge and history that he brings into this makes it a unique, rich read 
 I would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that "Fabric of the Cosmos" is just a rehash of "Elegant Universe" with little more to offer, and in fact not as well written.  On the contrary, I found "Fabric of the Cosmos" to be equally as engaging as "Elegant Universe" and to offer a great deal of new material.  It is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books, but I for one preferred it that way.  I read "Elegant Universe" several years ago, and although I have a general feel for the concepts, I appreciated the refresher on many of the details.  By including the background material in "Fabric of the Cosmos" I never felt lost, and I never had to refer back to another book.  The background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books, but it is not identical, so I never felt like I was rereading the same old stuff.  Another minor issue I've seen some complain about is the use of The Simpson's (and other) television characters in his examples.  Personally I could care less what characters are used in the examples, but from a practical standpoint, I much preferred names like Marge and Lisa to names like Slim and Jim (which were used in "Elegant Universe").  I could easily keep track of what Marge and Lisa were doing in an example, whereas I was often confused about what Slim and Jim were doing.  The similar sounding names drove me crazy.  So from a practical standpoint, I preferred the names used in "Fabric of the Cosmos".  Now what about the content of the two books?  For me "Elegant Universe" was more of an introduction to string theory, whereas  "Fabric of the Cosmos" was much more an exposition on cosmology.  In "Elegant Universe" roughly the first 130 pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics, and then the remainder of the book, some 250 pages, was about string theory.  In "Fabric of the Cosmos" roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics, (about 120 pages) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of "what is space" and "what is time".  Then roughly the next 200 pages give an outstanding description of where we're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe.  If you want an excellent description of inflation theory, Higgs fields, and the like, this is the source.  And then only in the last roughly 120 pages does Greene bring string theory into all of this, and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book.  Bottom line is "Fabric of the Cosmos" provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that I did not get from "Elegant Universe".  Both books are outstanding, and I would certainly recommend both.  The point being simply that these are different books, and "Fabric of the Cosmos" is not just a rehash of "Elegant Universe".  Finally, as in "Elegant Universe", Greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next.  I've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived.  In Greene's book this is never an issue.  Sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense, but I would much prefer a book that I can logically work my way through, albeit sometimes with a bit of patience, than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve.  Don't get me wrong though, even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense, I never found it to be dry.  Greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout.  Very highly recommended 
 This book has a wealth of information, for those interested in building dories.  Clear and consise explanations, as well as a great how to build chapter, were excellent.  I have begun building a swampscott dory, and  would be lost without this book.  Anyone interested in building wooden  dories would be wise to have this book in their collection 
 During a scene in the Secret of NIMH, Mrs. Brisby, the film's heroine, reads an inscription that says: "You can open any door if you only have the key." The nuance, if you listen to the lullaby during the end credits, is that this key is love. In a film rich with nuances, this one is the key not only for Mrs. Brisby but also for the film itself, for it was Don Bluth and his team's obvious love for the art of animation that enabled them to create this moving dramatization of Robert C. O'Brien's novel.   The Secret of NIMH is as much for adults as it is for children. Emotional and often tense, it explores what it means to be truly human, courageous, and loving.  The film, which departs somewhat from the novel, is about a widowed field mouse, Mrs. Brisby, who must move her children before the farmer crushes her home during the spring plowing. But her youngest son is critically ill with pneumonia and cannot be moved. After rescuing a lonely but charming crow, Jeremy, Mrs. Brisby visits with his help the Great Owl, hoping that he can solve her conundrum. The solution, the Owl says, is to seek help from the feared and mysterious Rats of NIMH, who live in the rosebush near the farmer's house.   During the film, as Mrs. Brisby repeatedly risks her life to save her family, she learns many secrets. She learns the secret of her husband's death and his connection with the Rats. She learns about the Rats' struggle. And she learns that, with her mother's love and courage, she possesses that essential but elusive key to open any door.   The Rats of NIMH, collectively, are one of the most evocative symbols in storytelling of the question of humanity, what it means to be human, to think and feel as a human. Their struggle represents the central question of humanity -- that of morality. Once tortured at NIMH (the National Institutes of Mental Health) by "humans," and genetically engineered to develop intelligence associated with humans, the Rats are divided about their destiny. Should they live in the rosebush, stealing food and electricity from the farmer's stores, or should they leave to build their own civilization, a society based on moral choices? Should they help Mrs. Brisby? Some of the rats consider her to be one of "the lower animals" who should fend for themselves, yet others feel compassion and honor her husband's courage in helping to free them from NIMH.   In the Rats' and in Mrs. Brisby's struggles, we ask ourselves what it means to be human and whether we, considering our behavior towards others, are truly human. Is morality, is humanity, a province belonging only to us? Does it belong to us at all?  I think it's not too much to say that this story charges us to consider whether we, who experiment on "the lower animals" and disregard them, are not as human as the Rats, for we are building our society on practices many consider to be immoral choices, whereas the Rats seek a society based on moral choices.  This is an intricate film with an evocative score, backgrounds, character body language, and script to express the urgency and violence of the characters' struggles. But it is also an inspiring story with Jeremy's reliable comic relief and -- a spoiler here -- a happy end. As an artistic work, it shows what can happen when artists have the key and cooperate to use it.   I recommend to parents that you watch this with your children and discuss it with them to the degree you feel comfortable. It's one of the better ways to explore valuable lessons about courage, compassion, morality, and love 
 I like further a lot better, would recommend that to be purchased before this one, they are both good but I was expecting more from it, descent hard mix, blends well together.... B 
 An interesting look inside Enron from a "regular" employee's perspective.  Plus, Cruver has a good sense of humor.  "Conspiracy of Fools" is a much more detailed account of Enron's criminal activities, but as you read it you keep thinking, "Were they really so obnoxious that they though they would get away with that?"  Cruver has you laughing as you realize they really were!  
 I owned a mono LP of this at its first release, and I'm pleased to finally have it on CD. I'm happy to find the laughs still intact! The huge Tanglewood audience is clearly having a great time (I have a friend who was in the audience in the Shed that night and he said it was even more hilarious in person) and Sherman's brilliant parodies seem even funnier after more than 40 years. Did Peter Schikele get his inspiration for PDQ Bach from this album?  This by the way is just about the best "live" recording I've ever heard. Produced by Peter Dellheim and engineered by Edwin Begley, two stars in the Victor recording firmament, they capture the "live" sound of the Pops well, keep the audience response low enough so the orchestra can be heard (though the more than 13,000 people in the Shed are still most definately in the room!), and hearing it in stereo for the first time, on a "surround" system, is quite an experience.  The reproduction of the notes on the back of the original Red Seal album IS hard to read, though under a lens it's possible. The essay on the inside, though also difficult to read, explains much about this album and its place in Sherman's life.   I met Sherman in late 1967 in a deli on East 60th Street here in Manhattan, introduced myself as a music student, told him how much I loved this album, and thanked him for it. HIs surly and curt response shocked me at the time, but, reading the essay in this CD, now I understand it. This night, 22 July 1964, was indeed, sadly, the "most exciting night" of his life 
 Harrison collects columns written for various publications between the years 1990 and 2000 and presents them in one handy volume.  There is no doubting that Harrison loves to indulge himself with great food, great wine and great company.  And he can tell a tale.  Harrison is at his best when rhapsodizing about memorable meals and contemplating his existence in the universe.  Harrison is at his worst when trying to impress the reader that despite living much of the year in the sticks of Upper Peninsula Michigan or borderlands Arizona--he is indeed a jet-set world traveler, who knows everyone (Hollywood, Paris, the Big Apple, Key West) and is quite a witty dinner companion (he kept Winona Ryder in stiches one evening).  Ultimately, I found it best to put up with the occasional self ego masaaging boast in order to indulge in some superb food writing 
 If I had kids, I'd be stealing these out of their lunch bag. Cheeky bastards!  I get afternoon chocolate cravings and can't scarf down Snickers bars everyday (at least not if I'm spending most of my day sedentary in an offic chair).  The zBar Brownies offer all the satisfaction of chocolate with the wholesomeness of oatmeal.  Ok, so it's not as rich and creamy as something from Hershey.  But they are damn good without olestra, saccharine, and other ingredients that will embalm you.  And the #1 ingredient is Organic Oats.  The #2 ingredient is organic chocolate chips. If that wasn't a good enough start, all the other ingredients are organic too.      1 bar = 1 serving 120 calories 25 calories from fat 1g of saturated fat 0g trans fat 0mg cholesterol  The biggest downside is 12g of sugar, but that's still doing better than most sweet snacks.  I love these bars because they are tasty and filling. They are a "healthy" alternative to the tempations in your local vending machine.    Cheers 
 I strongly recommend this book to any conscientious owner of a fearful dog.  Our puppy showed fear of many things at an early age and we are lucky to have gotten a trainer - and read this book - as soon as we discovered this problem. The author points out that dealing with a dog's fear is a LOT of work and that the problems don't go away overnight. She is very realistic in explaining the challenges and setting your expectations. The tools she offers are practical and she writes in plain, everyday English that a regular dog owner can understand. Diligently following her advice has made a huge difference for our dog.   
 As usual, Lois Ehlert stimulates and educates the young reader about the mysteries of caterpillars to butterflies. Not only are the colors absolutely stunning, she provides factual information about different species. This book was a fabulous preparation for my classroom of small children as they watched their own caterpillars prepare for their magical transformation 
 The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the source for many later movies, TV series and books.  Land of the Lost, which funny enough seems to be the source for The Lost World and Lost TV series, is one of the many shows I believe owe some of its birth to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The idea is that Professor Challenger has found an area in the New World where such animals as dinosaurs still walk on the surface of the Earth.  Of course you know the rest.  Nobody believes him so he collects a group together to go see and, behold, tons of action, adventure and vague science stuff.  Good, solid book but either new or used will do. 
  The wisest man who ever lived called us to drink the cup with him. Henri Nouwen writes of this call with jewel-like clarity. Once again he captures the essence of the journey into the deep place where the true self is found 
 I loved this book. It may be predictable-but is fun! It is a great summer escape. Who wouldn't want to be stuck on island with a nerd? Well the nerd turns out to be this great hunky guy! I was able to just have kick-back time reading and wished that I  too was in a tropical paradise-it has a good ending, too! If you think you'll like this book, you'll like The North kingdom (by Jordan N. Danniels). It has some hunky guys who aren't what they appear to be either 
 I have worn Arizona Birks for years.  I have Plantars Fascitiis and the arch support in these sandals is just what I need.  I wear them daily.  This is one of the best products for my condition, aside from the obvious benefit of wearing sandals 
 This collection of music is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something unique. I found every song on these 4 CD's beautiful. It opens up a whole new world for some people, including myself. It gives you a taste of many different bands and lets you explore what you like and dislike. I've bought many CD's from the bands featured in this set. Its not very expensive and you won't regret it 
 Admittedly, to enjoy this book it helps if you're somewhat of a bibliophile. But mostly I found the book interesting for its history of science and the resistance, even hostility, to new ideas; specifically the `Copernican heresy' for which (in part) Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 and in 1632 Galileo was put under house arrest for life. Indeed prudently, Copernicus published his "De revolutionibus" while on his deathbed beyond the reach of the Inquisition. Gingerich managed to locate 501 copies of the 1543 and 1566 editions (and about a hundred of the 1617 edition) of "De revolutionibus" carefully scrutinizing the annotations in all of them. He found copies that had been owned by Tyco Brahe, Kepler, Bruno, Galileo and others involved in overturning Ptolemy's deeply ingrained view of the Universe.   Deeply ingrained concepts aren't easily overturned. In my book "Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics" on pages 34, 41-2, 183, 249 and 279, I draw an analogy between the tenacity back then of the concept of the Earth as the center of the Universe and now the concept of God as the creator and ruler of the Universe.  
 I was reccommended to read Planet of The Blind due to my interest in writing stories about people who had disabilities and about by own disablility for I'm visually impaired myself and I have an interest in writing. So I read Steven Kuusisto's book Planet of the Blind and found it very facinating and inspiring! I highly reccomend it! I'd love to know what is he doing now and is he still writing and speaking of the book 
 When I read `The Devil Inside' earlier this year, I couldn't wait for this sequel to be released.  As soon as it arrived on my doorstep, I dropped everything I was doing - including wrapping Christmas presents - and started reading.  It's like I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  WOW!  This one was great and I'm praying Vali plans to continue the Casey Clan story, especially knowing how this second installment ends (no spoilers here).  A still-healing Cain is in the hospital, recovering from an FBI-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.  Emma almost flees the proverbial coop again when the rest of the family - most importantly, the kids -- is attacked in their own home.  However, her reignited love for Cain impels her to stay the course.  Emma struggles only briefly with the retaliation she knows Cain will take on her enemies, but stands tall and proud with her enigmatic wife as they get revenge while under the watchful eye of the FBI.  Not only is this a great crime story where you want the bad guy to win, this is an incredible romance.  The protagonists are outwardly strong and invincible, but in the privacy of their relationship both women feel secure enough to admit their fears and concerns.  They have an intense love for their children, an honorable defensiveness of their allies, an incomparable hatred for their enemies, and an unsurpassable passion for each other.  This is one reader who will be completely disappointed if Vali ends the story here.  Doing so would be a crime. 
     In my opinion, Al Jolson was one of the two greatest popular singers (with Sinatra) in America in the twentieth century.  Bing Crosby was very close behind them.  Furthermore, Crosby may have been second to none in his duets with many of the best singers of his era.       These two discs present radio broadcasts Jolson and Crosby did together.  They include a huge number of mostly terrific songs, interspersed with chit-chat, some hokey, some amusing, some touching.  In the electronic age, it's easy enough to listen to the chatter once, but listen to the songs repeatedly.         Most of these songs were recorded separately by Jolson, Crosby, or both, and in most cases this album is no substitute for those separate recordings.  For one thing, most of them are shortened, compared to the recordings.  Nevertheless, this is a superb album.  The fun these two great singers are having together is infectious.  And there is plenty of great singing 
 Let me preface this by saying that I loved "Neverwhere."  This book of short fictions was incredible. My personal favorites - the little story in the introduction and Nicholas - great reading for the engaged and before Christmas.  Who can forget Murder Mysteries?  What a fantastic collection of stories for anyone who enjoys Gaiman OR SF 
 This machine works pretty good.  The person that reviewed this machine and has five kids to wash for bought the WRONG machine.  This is not a heavy duty large family machine.  Anyone would think this machine could handle the laundry of five people in two loads needs expand their horizons and look at high capacity washers.  This machine is for couples and singles in apartments not the Waltons and certainly not the Brady Bunch.  For the price you could have bought two maytag washers and two dryers and did your laundry in the four hours you say one load.  I know someone that will buy your machine for under $300 if your interested 
 The above book is a MUST READ!!! If you have bought books 1 thru 4 in the Cape Refuge Series, this one completes the story line.  Terri Blackstock keeps you guessing in this "who done it" tale. 
 Only The Lonely is  a good romantic comedy type movie that has a great cast that includes, John Candy, Ally Sheedy, Maureen O'Hara, Anthony Quinn and Milo O'Shea. The movie is about a Irish American cop who lives in Boston with his over bearing overly opinionated mother and he falls in love with a woman who is mother doesn't like. This is a cute movie and I'm glad that they finally have put it on DVD 
 Although it was read in conjunction with an urban history class, I found this book to be very engaging and moving. Rosenberg's writing flows easily through a very disturbing subject. He sets up very fluid parallels between  the epidemic's appearance at all three major years: 1832, 1849, and 1866.  Of special interest is the role of the NYC Metropolitan Board of Health in  controlling and defeating the epidemic.. I hope I didn't ruin the ending  for any interested readers: NYC is still a healthy city, despite outbreaks  like the ones that Rosenberg identifies.. 
 It took me a lot of years to get around to reading this book, and it was on the recommendation of one of my daughters.  To read about the realm of King Arthur from a woman's point of view was unique and beautifu 
 This is a wonderful book.  It is one that you want to read over and over again.  I am definately going to get the other two that just recently came out.  
 This is what we've been waiting for! Steven Lynch at his best touching, sensitive and beguiling to the final detail. Buy this CD and throw away all your other less satisfying works by other artists. 
 This series of books from Emberly are the easiest books on drawing there are, period. Anyone young or old can learn to draw some great critters and vehicles from these books. All of his Big Color books are great, as is his "Make A World" book. This one is famous for the easy way it shows you how to draw step by step, what appears to be a complex pirate ship. He even shows you how to make yours unique rather than a copy of his drawings. You can be the doodle hero of your class or office after using this book. He does it simply using very simple steps, lines, and basic shapes to start you off. If you want to learn the terminology of what you are doing, and really become an accomplished artist, the next step after these are the terrific Jack Hamm books. If you just want to have some fun, get this book 
 This book was very well written and has a deep plot. The themes in this book are not clear but there are themes. On theme is you should never give up. This is showed by Axel's uncle, he keeps going on without caring about the dangers that lay ahead. He also can persuade them by his voice that is all knowing leads Axel to believe that he should keep going on. This act of bravery helps them through their toughest challenges.    This book is somewhat believable because they describe the scenery so well that it seems real not just in a book. But the book seems unreal because we all know what happens in real life so this book breaks the natural laws of the earth. Though the book seems that you could do what axel and his uncle did you can't. This is a great book and is a fun adventurous book to read. 
 the author reveals the work and task at hand involved in castle building ( and a small township nearby).... i loved following the progress of the construction from the chosen site... to the tools used... especially the fortificatons and defense structures... its as close as i can get to actually living in the ages of castles... a highly recommended read!!!!!... 
 Let me just say I don't read much, it takes me along time to finish a book, but I read this book cover to cover in one night. Moody presents information that is not only exciting, It makes many connections to explanations of death in many cultures! I think the world needs to pay attention to this information, only so our children will not have to know the terrible fear of the uknown! They will look back at our time and say "I couldn't imagine living with that fear." and this fear is a terrible thing. I am so greatful to moody for writing this book. Even if you are a skeptic, at the end of the book Moody adresses the skeptics questions, and shows the viewpoints of scientists, biologists and their views on the NDE. A must read for EVERYONE!! 
 Six years ago I was cleaning out my grandmother's house to be sold after she passed away.  I came across letters written around the same time period that this novel was to have taken place. When I read this book, the dialogue was so familiar.  The letters were written phonetically much like the book. Reading them did make it difficult to comprehend and just like the book, at first it slowed the reading process for me but it began to sound like poetry. A previous reviewer said it best  "the dialogue captures the southern drawl and syntax to its truest form."  I had never heard of Hurston before this novel and probably would not have had it not been promoted by Oprah. I did not see the movie so I cannot compare.  Some will not like the dialogue and find it hard to follow and some will not be able to relate to the characters or the life as it was at that time. This should be included in reading list for schools. This is fiction but this represents a time and a people and the reality that should not be lost in history. 
 Been looking for a copy of this movie for our mom.  She loves the story and her copy got lost 
 I loved Stanley Crouch's book.  It presents black characters in ways that are rarely presented in fiction, as people who talk about life with wit and humor on a very civilized level. They talk about justice and the purpose of  existence.   They talk about literature (Shakespeare),  about classical  music (Wagner), about painting (Leonardo and Picasso). And when they  discuss jazz - as is to be expected in a book about a black jazz saxophone  soloist and a white woman from Idaho who becomes a serious jazz singer -  they talk not only about the feeling of jazz but about its content and the  ideas that underlie it. 	Another strikingly original aspect of this  book is that Crouch represents religion in our society as a powerful and  stabilizing force (his description of a black church service in Houston is  compelling and masterly).		Is Crouch discursive?  Of course he is,  but so was Shaw, and how about Homer 
 I received the 2nd ed. of this book in massage school.  I purchased the 3rd ed. to study for my National test.  WOW! I truly did not think this book could have gotten any better, but it DID! It shows all different views of muscles, muscle groups, bones, boney landmarks, how to find boney landmarks to find muscles, latin/greek roots of the words, study hints, remembering devices, WONDERFUL illustrations!   I also purchased the Student Workbook -  which is an ENTIRELY new text with this edition - and it has a lot of different ways to test yourself to prepare for tests.  If you need to know ANYTHING relating to the muscles/bones of the body, YOU NEED THIS BOOK! Don't let the cost fool you ... it is NOT overpriced. I used to think it was (when I found out how much it was by itself - my 2nd ed. was included with my tuition at school), until I bought this new edition.  They added an obscene amount of new pages, and updated their illustrations to make them even EASIER to understand.  If you have any doubts about this book, log on to the publishers website discoverybooks . com - there are excerpts, downloadable pages, etc.  Hope this helps 
 The authors argue that style is one of the hallmarks of the master negotiator.  Roy J. Lewicki, a business professor at Ohio State University and Alexander Hiam, a consultant, argue to master every negotiating opportunity and resolve conflicts, you need to adjust your approach.  By considering the importance of both outcome and relationship, you can adapt your tactics to the situation.  The following strategies can be adapted:  *	Avoiding - otherwise known as Lose - Lose.  The priorities for both the relationship and the result are low.  Neither is important enough to pursue the conflict further. *	Accommodating - otherwise known as Lose to Win.  Importance of relationship is high; importance of the result is low. *	Competing - otherwise known as Win to Lose.  Importance of result is high; importance of relationship is low. *	Collaborating - otherwise known as Win - Win.  Importance of result and relationship is high. *	Compromising - otherwise known as Split the Difference.  A combination approach.  The authors state it is important to prepare for the negotiations.  They offer an eight step method:  1.	Define the issues and goals. 2.	Order the issues and agenda. 3.	Analyze the other party. 4.	Define the underlying interests. 5.	Consult with interested parties. 6.	Set goals for the process and outcome. 7.	Identify you own limits. 8.	Develop supporting arguments.  As you interact with the other party, it is important to recognize that everything you do and every decision you make is part of the negotiation.  The authors advise following these rules to pilot the middle ground in a competitive negotiation.  1.	Stick to your planned target and walk-away points. 2.	Do not reveal your target until you are close. 3.	Never reveal your walk-away point. 4.	Get the other party to make big concessions. 5.	Keep your concessions few, slow and small. 6.	Investigate the other party's level of concern for the outcome.  This book is an invaluable resource for anyone facing a negotiation.  And who isn't?  The skills and techniques discussed by the authors will prepare everyone, from the high-powered business executive to the person facing informal day-to-day challenges of selling, buying and getting along with colleagues 
 Dick Couch takes you on a good look into the training of Seal Class 228.  His way of writing is easy to read and the book is laid out well and informative.  I did not care for his attempts at ego shots towards the Army schools that provide specialized training to the other services along with the seals.  I'm sure you can tell that this is my biased opinion though :-)   All in all it was a good read 
 My wife and I were concerned about teaching our children to be responsible and understand money.  We were unable to find a satisfactory book or sytem until we used this tool.  Our four year old has been using the system layed out in this pack, and she thinks it's COOL 
 Lamb of God establishes that they are on top of the American metal scene with this album.  They have an amazing thrash technicality with hardcore sound.  This is a must-have for any metal collection.  I would also strongly recommend LoG's follow up, As The Palces Burn.  I, for one, love Randy Blythe's vocals, and I hope that no true metalhead who reads a review describing them as "Rah, Rah, Rah, Blah, Blah screaming mess" will take it seriously.  If you want clean vocals, you can listen to the new Panic! CD.  I heard it's peachy 
 I've liked this cd ever since i heard it. It has really good songs in it espicialy, Hero & aerosmith's version of The Spider-man theme. I really think it's cool that they got the Original Spider-Man Theme on this cd, too bad they didn't do that for the hulk. All in All This Cd Rocks. If You liked this one get spider-man score & spider-man 2 & spider-man 2 Score. Awesome cd 
 Almost every article in there is still valid although it was written years a go. The greatest authors on OO programming and C++ edited by the GURU MARTIN, (Uncle Bob).  If you consider yourself an OO P/A/D and C++ is of interest to you don't miss this book!! Oh and do yourself a favor get the more C++ gems too.. 
 The genius resident in this mighty and "prolifick" work is off the charts, lacking borders, bounds and limits. "Mason & Dixon" is a picaresque Iliad by a supremely gifted and inventive storyteller. The "electrick" writing on each of the 773 pages is luminous beyond belief. The characters are deeply human "comick" and "mystick" figures who consistently extend the wit of their banter well beyond the first or second brilliant repartee of each stretch of dialogue. The "vistos" of wild American colonial landscape in both city and countryside, on land and "oceanick", in royal and humble society in Pynchon's Great Chain of Being are breathtaking. The dialogue is intelligent and witty and often hilarious. Meet Franklin, Col. Washington, Penn, Calvert, Boswell and Dr. Johnson -- all in the mileux of their day -- in adventures high and low. "Mason & Dixon" is an American Human Comedy written in the style of Fielding in "Tom Jones" or Sterne in "Tristram Shandy" or Barth in "The Sotweed Factor." An intricate and elegantly woven story line awaits those who must have one. High science and political intrigue of the day abound for those who love reading 18th century American history. Most of all, the writing quality is so evenly elegant throughout this opus maximus that its supreme and sustained intelligence is the signature of a writer of Nobel Prize stature. Pynchon's body of work, including "V." "M&D" and "Gravity's Rainbow," are sufficient evidence of the breadth of his literary gifts. Only a handful of writers in this era are capable of writing metafiction at this lofty level -- Gaddis, Gass, Theroux, Barth, Donleavy and Bellow. Is Pynchon as brilliant as Nobel Laureate, Bellow? Pynchon is, at least, equally worthy. Few novels have so much going for them on so many levels. "Carpe carpum." Do yourself a favor and seize this brilliant, carping novel: someday its cover shall bear the seal of the Nobel Prize for it is a "magnetick" American Iliad -- a shimmering and timeless Flower of Light.      
 For those who have just finished Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth", and are interested in additional lighter-than-average reading, Elizabeth Kolbert's book, "Field Notes from a Catastrophe" is a fine next choice.  Here, the alarm factor is relatively subdued.  Kolbert is straight-forward and matter-of-fact.  The reading selections are vivid, and work to intensely quantify the challenges ahead.  Kolbert's stunning line is the final sentence of the book:  "It may seem impossible to imagine that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself, but that is what we are in the process of doing."   Sounds as if we are on some bad heroine, or are we really? 
 I must first preface my comments by saying that I think Larry the Cable Guy is funny guy, but he is no Richard Pryor.   I am a white anglo-saxon who thinks that Richard Pryor was one of the most funny people who ever lived, and if you asked Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, or Ron White who was the better comedian I think they would all pick Richard Pryor because Rich could find humor in the most unlikeliest sources, whereas Larry is rather obvious in his basis for humor.  Good though, but not as profound as Richard Pryor.  This along with the other two Richard Pryor stand up films should be the proof of what a comedian is all about.   Yes, Rich used rough language, but listen to words between the cuss words, he was a very smart comic who had all the ablities needed to be the legend he was.  
 At over 1000 pages (grease-resistant), a binding format that separates this massive book into four easy-to-handle volumes (and allows you to transfer the pages to a ring-binder, if preferred), every little detail the novice needs, all the advanced information the experienced mechanic wants, quick-find chapter dividers, and comprehensive coverage of all parts of the bike and all technologies are just some of the features that make this manual the bicycle tool you can't do without.  More than a thousand computer-generated illustrations with phenomenal detail and clarity are used. More than ever, words and pictures are used together to optimize and simplify understanding.   There are recommendations and procedures for numerous new tools introduced since 2000.  Almost 200 additional forks and shocks covered in their new release fifth edition (available on their website.  Look for BBinstitute or Barnett Bicycle Institute using Google). Dozens of new disc brakes covered. Integrated headsets now covered. Expanded coverage of Campagnolo products. Procedures for servicing newer models of pedals and cartridge-bearing hubs added. Wheel-building procedures for low-spoke-count and paired-spoke wheels. Procedures in every chapter have been refined and expanded.  Best there is out there for sure.  Great investment.  Not a waiste of money  
 Been wearing them for about 10 years now - never liked the feel of briefs. Hanes boxers fit & feel great. They are nice and baggy with plenty of leg & seat room. They also last a long time & hold up well in the washer. My only advice is to size-UP when you order. I got a 34 waist & only wear size LARGE. Med is too snug . Hanes boxers are classic comfort for the guy that has to feel some slack in the sack 
 All The Reviews I read are unfair. Come on this album is magnificient and deserves to be reviewed honestly. Skye is gone, Morcheeba is dead who you are to claim this kind of stuff Daisy is an excellent singer and has a personnality. Be honest and listen this album with open heart and you'll see this album is great and more the best 
 Jasper Fforde is very funny.  This series is well worth your time.  He uses so many references to great literature (as well as poor literature) and it's caused me to go back and do some re-reading.  The plot lines are mysteries/ adventure while at the same time revolving on how the story lines we all know are changed by Thursday Next and her counterparts to end up the way they are today, as she jumps from book world to book world.  Read the Thursday Next books before the Nursery Crimes books 
 Yes, it is a simple, uncomplicated story.  Yes, they could have developed the relationship between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald a little more.  But despite its minor faults, this is one of my very favorite movies.  It's a wonderful story that could easily have remained just a local legend, but I'm glad it didn't. I found the interactions between the Englishmen and the Welsh villagers hilarious, as well as the continuing sabotage of the Englishmens' attempts to leave the village.  I thought the storyline about "Johnny shell-shocked" added just the right amount of depth without being overdone.  And the end of the movie was quite satisfying, as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe I'm just an old sap, but I enjoy this story.  And I love that they show the actual mountain/hill at the end, along with the children of the people represented in the film.  If you want to watch a movie that presents an engaging story without unnecessary embellishment, this is a good choice 
 an ideal husband is an amazing work of literature. being witty, charming, and yet very intelligent, wilde's play is well written and enjoyable. read the play, then watch the movie. you're guaranteed a good time : 
  ...was to forgo a college "education."  Why?  Because I managed to avoid the type of brainwashing that BEN SHAPIRO so clearly illustrates in his book, BRAINWASHED.  I recently arrived home from work surprised to find BRAINWASHED in my mailbox.  It had been sent to me by a good friend in Kansas (I'll call him "Kevin" [1]) whose nice Sister I dated for five years over a decade ago.  "Kevin" sent it because it's "a good book", and he wrote, "I expect a full review of this."  (This is the review, with footnotes!)  Because Ben Shapiro was a columnist for UCLA's newspaper, THE DAILY BRUIN, and because I have a significant connection with UCLA, "Kevin" thought I'd find the book particularly interesting.  He was right.  I was born a "Bruin" at the UCLA Medical Center in 1959 [2] and worked for the campus Parking Department from 1985 through 1992.  I remember all too well the dogmatic liberalism of the indoctrinated students and the pronounced Leftist lean of the school's Socialistic bullhorn, THE DAILY RUIN. [3]  (I'd try reading it over dinner at The Cooperage food court but it would invariably "ruin" my appetite!)  Ben's book is very good, and though I've given it an overall grade of Four Stars, if you have a son or daughter currently (or soon to be) enrolled at ANY university in this country, then you should consider this a Five Star book and run - don't walk - to acquire a copy of it. [4]  In BRAINWASHED, Ben addresses many pillars of Liberalism and shows how they are promoted throughout the university system.  One of the most cherished, of course, is affirmative action which provides us with "Diversity" which is that essential tool for creating the strength of "Unity." [5]  On page 53 we meet that rare Latino student who approves of Ben Shapiro's anti-affirmative action protest because he doesn't "want everyone thinking whatever I do in life, I got the opportunity to do it because of my race.  It's insulting."  That reminded me of "Kevin's" Sister.  I met her on the UCLA campus while she was a student.  One trait that attracted me to her was her independent stance and determination to make it in life on merit and not a "gimme."  She was half Mexican [6] and therefore eligible to check the "Hispanic" box when applying to UCLA, but she told me she marked "White" instead because she didn't want to always wonder if she was accepted merely because of ethnicity. [7]  Another section of Ben's book that elicited some very personal UCLA-related memories for me was titled, RODNEY KING AND THE LOS ANGELES "UPRISING."  I was a UCLA employee at the time of the L.A. Riots and I still find it somewhat ironic that the first night that rioting broke out, I was meeting my best friend from the department -- I'll call him "Lonnie" [8] - after work for video game competitions, which we commonly referred to as "A##-Whuppins." [9]  "Lonnie" was Black. [10]  That the jury found the police officers innocent in the beating of Rodney King was reprehensible.  The aftermath even more so.  Back then, I was supervising student employees and responsible for training them in various aspects of special events preparation and parking equipment maintenance.  One student I remember fondly was a young, Black comic book artist who I'll call "Stephen."  [11]  Shortly after the Rodney King riots, he and I discussed the issue and I explained many factors that the media, the politicians, the police, and the citizens were either ignoring or not cognizant of.  Afterwards, "Stephen", this young Black man, paid me one of the two finest compliments I've ever received up to the present day.  I won't state what he said [12] as it might seem boastful and self-serving, but his ability to set aside emotion and preconceived judgments in order to gain real understanding of complex dynamics filled me with hope for our young, socialistically-indoctrinated university students.  Under PARTISAN POLITICS, Ben discusses minimum wage laws.  He understands the folly.  I got an object lesson in it many years ago:  Being an ice cream junkie, I was a regular at Dairy Queen.  One day I noticed that the price of their "Blizzards" had gone up and enquired about it.  The manager answered honestly, "The minimum wage went up, so our prices did too."  Got that?  The companies aren't going to see the wage increase cut into their profit margins so they pass the increased cost on to the customer.  Now, who generally earns a "minimum wage" in this country?  Young people who are employed at fast food restaurants, video stores, convenience markets, music shops, etc.  Where do young people spend most of their money?  Fast food restaurants, video stores, convenience markets, music shops, etc.  Their minimum wage increase gets absorbed into the market the moment they receive it because of the raised prices to cover the wage increase.  Their financial situation therefore hasn't improved one whit, but don't the Leftist politicians look so "humanitarian" when they fight for the little guy?  The only area in which Ben Shapiro needs to do a little more "homework" is The War On Terrorism.  He is misguided by the Neo-Con party line in this regard and needs to ask hard but reasonable questions and insist upon reasonable answers.  I found chapters 8 and 9 to be the obvious weak links in an otherwise very good and important book.  (But genetically modified crops make me nervous, Ben!  Can we REALLY improve on God's "nature"?)   On page 78 you'll find the whole heart of the matter; as accurate a statement as can be found in any political book by anyone.  Ben is undoubtedly more percipient than even he realizes.  We're led to believe that the "solutions" to all of our problems (which were deliberately created by socialists in BOTH major political parties) "is global socialism."  What a surprise!  [13]  I highly recommend BRAINWASHED by Ben Shapiro.  And though the writer is a Conservative, I have it on good authority that this one doesn't burn books, drown cats, mug old women, steal candy from children, or even blow deadly secondhand smoke into the faces of liberals.  Read this book and then you'll understand why colleges are referred to as "institutions of higher education."  [14]  FOOTNOTES: [1] Because that is his name. [2] After putting my Mom through 9 months and 3 weeks of pregnancy, and 40 hours of labor.  Obviously, I was very eager to come into your world. [3] Uh...I meant, "The Daily Bruin." [4] Before your child is transformed into a morally impaired Marxist marionette. [5] Hee-Hee!  To quote Jo Van Fleet from the movie, East Of Eden, "If you don't think that's funny, you'd better not go to college." [6] It was her left half. [7] I always did like intelligent women. [8] Because that was his name. [9] I usually gave more than I got. [10] Unfortunately, I've lost touch with him, but I'm guessing he still is. [11] Because that was his name. [12] He said, "It's just as well you never went to college; they have nothing to teach you." [13] See my Listmania List titled, "(BE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK TO) WAKE UP TO THE POLITICAL MATRIX." [14] Because nowhere will you find teachers "higher" and more in need of being "institutionalized." 
 I had seen a presentation from this company and wanted to learn more.  They are great and the book is fantastic 
 July 2002 was the saddest month of all. Leo McKern -- the quintessential Rumpole -- had died after a long illness and was survived one day by Maurice Denham who played Rumpole on BBC radio. So it seems that the possibility of a revival of visual episodes of has declined to almost zero. Nonetheless, there was always the hope that Sir John Mortimer would pen the story that launched the whole series..  ..and, after two collections of stories, it finally appeared.  So it was with some sadness that I took to Reading "The Penge Bungalow Murders" realizing it would probably be the last Mortimer would do for old Rumpole. My sorrow was compounded only slightly because it appears to me that Sir John phoned this one in. As others have pointed out, this episode seemed a somewhat flat and rather perfunctory effort; seemingly a work where all of the questions were being answered and the loose ends were being tied up.  We see how Rumpole became involved with the Timpsons. How he and Hilda became entwined (she played a far more important role in Rumpole's success and chambers' affairs than we could ever imagine), what an insufferable, doddering dolt her father and head of chambers, C. H. Wystan, was and how Horace developed his acerbic wit and contempt for the mediocrity passed off as "the finest traditions of the bar".  Why the five stars?  Because I cannot bear to rate it less. A Rumpole yarn, whether on or off, is a damned good read.  Like they say, the worst day fishing is better than the best day at work.  It was a marvelous run and sad that it probably has come to an end.   
 Since its publication nearly 20 years ago, Professor McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom has enjoyed the status as the definitive single volume treatment of the Civil War.  Over the years I have read Shelby Foote's great three part "Narrative History" and the three part Bruce Catton Civil War Trilogy, while those accounts are somewhat easier reads written with a novelist's touch, there is certainly much here to be admired.  McPherson is not content to merely provide an account of the battles, troop movements and casualty lists in the war, although to be sure some of that information is provided.  Instead he starts out with a painstaking examination of the American society in the decades leading up to the war, devoting the first 250 or so pages of the book to the political, economic and social changes facing the nation during that period.  By the time fighting starts in earnest, the book is about one third finished.  Occasionally Battle Cry of Freedom goes off in tangents, such as treatment of draft riots, political elections in border states, etc., which were all thoroughly-researched and illuminating.  However some casual history buffs, and those more interested in accounts of the famous battles and commanders, might get a little bogged down in details during some of these chapters.  Overall, I think this is a very well-written history text, clearly written by a historian, while books by Catton and Foote read like they were written by novelists.  You come away with this book understanding that Prof. McPherson has some strong opinions regarding many of the principal players in this conflict.  He clearly has great admiration for Lincoln, as an astute politician as well as an emancipator.   Grant and Sheridan come across as heroes, to no great surprise.  McPherson has little use for Joe Johnston and McClellan, who both come across as windbags hestitant to ever fight and lose a battle and thus tarnish their legacy.  McPherson seems to regard Ambrose Burnside as brave, loyal to a fault, but utterly incompetent; likewise John Bell Hood is brave and impetuous, but utterly outclassed by General Sherman.  As for Jefferson Davis, McPherson is fond of quoting Davis' fiery speeches and bold pronouncements of impending victory, even as the Confederacy was collapsing around him, but you get the sense that the author understood and accounted for the extraordinary pressures facing Davis, and the impossibility of his task.   One other interesting note - I was amazed at how often McPherson quoted earlier works by Shelby Foote and Bruce Catton as sources in his footnotes.  To be sure Battlecry of Freedom is a thoroughly well-researched text, but I was surprised how often a quote from a general or an account of a battlefield was attributed to one of Catton or Foote's histories, rather than the original sources.  
 The book I'm reviewing is At the Plate with Derek Jeter by Matt Christopher. I think this book deserves five stars. This book is a Derek Jeter biography. A problem that occurs in this story is when he's in high school. He almost gets cut from the team. This tells you how Derek Jeter became a pro baseball player. I would recommend this book to anybody.   Emerson N.J. fifth grade student  
 Its a good introductory book. The illustrations are helpful. Its a good place to start for someone who does not have experience in signal processing or communications 
 Like many people, I first encountered Horace Rumpole via the Thames / PBS television episodes. This "flashback" story will undoubtedly be a great treat for all Rumpole's fans around the world (as it was for me), partly because it provides the back-story for so many aspects of the famous barrister's life. However, I must agree with other reviewers who felt that the plot is not quite sufficiently complex for novel-length treatment. As did some other reviewers, I got to the "truth" of the story while Rumpole is still claiming to be in the dark. This may be because there are insufficient "red herrings" sprinkled along the way. It may also be because Mortimer's character depictions are so vivid that it's unusually easy to understand the motivations of the participants. Nonetheless, I had no difficulty finishing the book, thanks to Mortimer's wonderful style. Ironically, his to-the-point style, which moves the plot along swiftly, and which works so well in a short story, may be a relative disadvantage in a longer work of this type

 This is a difficult album to review. People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced, overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it, two characteristics of most Oasis songs.   It's no use comparing Be Here Now to Morning Glory or Def. Maybe, because it's in a whole other ballpark. This is Oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit. No doubt that all the coke helped with that. It's my firm belief that Morning Glory and Def. Maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. Be Here Now is just something else, you either love it or hate it. It has it's own little Oasis category. I can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors.  There are some valid complaints about this album, though. One, it is very very overproduced, filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long. Two, the songs are astonishingly long at times. All Around the World, while an excellent song, clocks in at around 9:20. I believe that the shortest song is I Hope, I Think, I Know, coming in at 4:23. So you know you're in for a long, wild ride.   However, only Oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. All the arrogance, coke, and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people. And of course, there's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : "The Beatles are quite good, but Oasis is much better."  And so a resounding yes to all of these: overproduced, arrogant, drug-induced, staggering, amazing, excellent. I don't care about the negative things, though, because that's what makes Be Here Now a sucess in its own right.     
 Wow, what a wonderful place this film goes to, and surprisingly so. Make your way through it somehow to the end. It's worth it. It has some tedious situations, and the Henry character is often distasteful, but overall, this film is the kind of great accomplishment that only the independents can achieve. If you consider yourself an artist of any type, and are wrestling with the questions around production and integrity, this film will be worth your while. It ends up pivoting profoundly around some of the great dilemmas of the modern artist, and offers up a few wonderful images, as well. Makes me want to pull down my ruled notebook and get to work. "Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep," said King Lear. A good fool is worth indulging, and maybe even more 
 This book is fabulous.  More so than Under the Tuscan Sun, and both are better than the movie.  Mayes has such a lightness to her writing, yet her words leave you filled.  She writes of the travels her husband and she make to various regions of Italy, describing the local foods, customs, and topography.  She includes wonderful recipes and paints life in Tuscany as a beautiful thing.  Read on an empty stomach and a full wallet (so you can hop on the next plane to Italy).  I read this before and after a month long trip to Italy and both times Bella Tuscany proved a great way to whet my appetite for the trip, and a nice way to reminisce afterwards 
 "With so many dissonances in my life I have learned actually to prefer being not quite right and out of place." This last line in Edward W. Said's memoir Out of Place is a fitting end to book that takes the reader on a journey from his childhood full of uncertainties and anxieties about being different, to embracing individualism at the end of Said's painful, yet privileged life. Said's memoir is chronologically dated from his childhood to the present, but interwoven amongst his life are stories about his family, colleagues, friends, and even himself that juxtaposition him in such a way that sometimes it is hard to follow how old or where Said is. Central to his memoir are Said's parents: His mother who demands his unconditional love, while often cruelly pointing out his faults and throwing wrenches into his relationships with his four sisters and girlfriends. His father starts out as a shadowy and silent, yet dominant presence in his youth. As Said grows though, their relationship becomes more interactive. This paradoxal relationship is demonstrated through his father's actions: paying for his son's elaborate trips to Europe, prep schools in Cairo, Beirut, Princeton, and Harvard, but chastising him for spending sixpence on a program to a play they once attended. Said's memory for his youth is astounding, remembering details of his schools, people he encountered, and descriptions of places he visited as if he wrote them down in stored away journals (he does not mention that he kept any journals), While Said is part Palestinian and grew up pre and post Israel, he often comments on the subject very fleetingly, or at least he seems not to want to go into the subject, suggesting only slightly of him being disgruntled with the situation. Said grew up in Cairo during the pre-WWII period, a time in Cairo he successfully describes as a romantic place for foreigners and is ruled under British sovereignty. In comparison to Tobias Wolfe's This Boy's Life, Out of Place depicts a Christian, part Palestinian, part Syrian male growing up in Cairo Egypt and vacationing around the Mediterranean and the Middle east while enjoying a privileged life of schooling and living Initially Said depicted himself as a misfit, but eventually growing into a strong intellectual who observed the great changes of Islamic culture during the 20th century. 
 This is bar-none the best MySQL (all-inclusive) book I've ever used.  I've been using MySQL for about 5-6 years (maybe longer I've lost count).  In projects from Personal stuff to Commercial and Corporate sites.  I feel like I know a lot about MySQL simply by using and Admin'ing it for most of this time.  I've learned a great deal from "The Definitive Guide to MySQL 5" and am making immediate use of several things that have made significant improvements to the current project I'm working on...and has given me ideas as to how to improve on a few sites I didn't think I could improve much on.  I would recommend this book for ANYONE interested in MySQL 5.  It's well organized, and provides enough information to use virtually anything related to MySQL 5.  Thanks to Michael Kofler for such a well written and organized book!  The only things I would have preferred just a tad more detail on is the use of Cursors in Stored Procedures.  Aside from that this is an EXCELLENT resource I highly recommend 
 i loved this movie! for me, i wish i saw this years ago so i would not of scared my friends away! very entertaining movie, very hilarious! good combination between kate & matthew, i also enjoyed the soundtrack to this movie 
 This is my 3rd Mozart album from this series and I am delighted with the choices.  Not only are the pieces ones' that are not always bandied about on Mazart CD's they are beautifully orchestrated and played.  The sound quality is excellent.  Yes this CD will quiet the mind and the soul and do so by engaging the senses in a delightful and appreciative way 
 It is not hard to see why this modern masterpiece was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1938. It was made into a classic movie starring Gregory Peck as Penny Baxter and was illustrated by the legendary N.C Wyeth. They would not have exhausted their immense talents on a mediocre book (as some of the reviews have expressed- were they reading the same book as me?).  The story is beautifully crafted and it flows effortlessly. The homespun language is quaint and is perfect for the book (which is set in the late 1800s). The author knew the intricacies of nature in Florida and described it with exactness and beauty. There are many sections of the book that are filled with warm humor and lightheartedness. The deep closeness between the father and son is touching as well as the love between the husband and wife.  Life was a tough stuggle then and it is brought out with great skill. Rawlings was a master of timing and decriptions.  (For those  high school students who were forced to read the book- read it again in ten years. I felt the same way about "To Kill A Mockingbird". In high school I hated it. Later in life- I loved it. Maturity adds a lot to any book).  There is one aspect of the book that is a little hard to believe- grown men getting up in the middle of the night to play their music on guitars and so forth- stark naked- in front a of a young neighbor- but that is only thing in the entire novel.  N.C. Wyeth's illustrations are perfect for the story. His use of strong directional lighting is fabulous. I would recommend the Scribner Classic (hardcover)with his illustrations in it.  Rawlings lived in the heart of the Florida woods in the winter time and was a keen observer of nature and men. I think I learned more about hunting from this book than from any other source.  Because this book lacks sex, extreme violence, aliens or risque humor- perhaps it seems dull to some- but it is for those very reasons that I was enthralled with it. Imagine a book filled with brilliant writing, a complex plot which is weaved by a consummate artist and many secondary adventures all which fortify the plot and without one tinge of cussing!   This book deserves ten stars not five 
 "In our Lifetime" was the first album i ever bought from Ball & G and ever since it's been a favorite. Most of the tracks are very well done with only a couple that don't stand out. My Favorites are "Paid Dues" w/ Cee-Lo, "Daylight", "Do it how it Go", "Armed Robbery" (i like this version better than the one on "Comin out Hard"), "Love Hurts", & "Throw your Hands up" w/Outkast. other records by ball & G to check out are "Comin out Hard", "On Top of the World", & "On the outside Lookin' In". Peace 
 This is the beast of Vangelis music that I have heard. It is so well coordinated with the oustanding movie,that the package is just fantastic. One has to keep in mind how hard it is in today's world to create epic movies such as Alexander and seal it with such breathtaking music. Fantastic is an understatement 
 This film concerns black men and nothing but black men, but these black men in the USA, due to their African heritage they cannot deny in any way though they at times don't even know about it and their European or western surroundings that they have not chosen whatsoever and yet cannot evade in the slightest way imaginable, (these black men) represent what white men are already living or will eventually soon live due to white women's liberation. Black women have never been the slaves of their men ever, and particularly not as much and as far as white women just fifty years ago still. The relations between black men and black women have to be built on personally chosen terms that have to vary from one pair of partners to another. That's what's love: something unique for each pair, couple or even group of people who experience it. Then why four men, with one father and one mother (in fact with a slight appearance of a second mother and a slightly less slight appearance of a third mother) behind? Four men like the four evangelists, the four gospels, the four cardinal points, the four winds, the four elements composing the universe, so many other four whatever. Four is a cultural structure that conveys in our civilization the idea of balance, equilibrium and perfection, and yet also that of a certain crucifixion, which is in its turn the promise of a resurrection and even farther off the promise of the final end of our world of tears and the eternal emergence of the messianic Jerusalem, the fulfilling of the millenium long prediction. Four men, thus, but one of them is different, the little young John, the visionary and apocalyptic one, three synoptic ones and one who stands apart. Patterns cannot evade our subconscious, and quite often conscious, way of thinking and imagination. For these men, the group, the brotherhood is the base to which you go back when you are disoriented. In our world and in African tradition it is not any more or has never been the family, at least certainly not the cellular family, a 19th century invention that is plainly exploding today when one adult buries his parents at the same time as he retires from his job and when his children are already raising their own children into teenage and high school. What they experience is love, manly love as Walt Whitman used to call it. But for their own sake they need procreative love that is hormonal, heterosexual and family-line forming. Black men are more advanced than white men, though their experience would look messy to white men: that is the kind of mess awaiting white men in the near future: they will have to live up to it or retire into oblivion. For white men it sounds like castration, frustration, and some other perversions. In fact it is looking for love where it is: everywhere. Love for procreation and physical pleasure that goes through sex, love for life experience and spiritual or professional performance and perspective, love for intimate sharing and interlacing of feelings, emotions and reflections. The latter two types have no obligation to be heterosexual since they are not sexual. The first type has to be sexual but is open today to personal and private choices. The film deals with this issue without any discretion at all with a wife refusing, being unable to give head to her husband - note well it is because her mummy told her it was disgusting. What her mummy told her definitely was disgusting and mean and coming from a time when sex was not pleasure but only a duty to be performed in order to continue the biological race and the blood line of the family. Finally note the director is very careful to avoid any ambiguous situation among these four men and even the father who is a fifth man, the fifth branch of a pentacle. No ambiguity, not even a hint, though of course we could see a lot of symbolic nuances and innuendo. But who understands symbolism in our world of direct and immediate real time communication: symbolism is indirect, delayed and slowed down communication, the food for the thinking of intellectuals.

 Winger IS great! This album is great!!! What I wanted to point out is that there are subtle things that make these songs great...different 'background' type sounds that make the songs funky or make you hungry to hear them again. (pun intended on 'hungry'!) For example, on "Seventeen" there is a fabulous center section where the guitar riffs are sexy and fun, and the rhythms change...it really adds to the song, it isn't just 'plop plop, plop plop' with the same rhythm throughout the song, which in my opinion, gets very boring!  Yes, Winger has slightly cheesy lyrics as was mentioned (on some songs) but the quality of the songs is not to be overlooked!  Top songs (IMO) are almost all the songs, notably Seventeen, Madalaine, Hungry, Without the Night (which I also agree is a great midtempo ballad!) and Headed for a Heartbreak.  Maybe I am the one of the only people to like this, but I think the Purple Haze cover is actually quite hot, and an interesting interpretation!  Please pick this cd up, it truly rocks, and since I have picked up the cd version recently, I can't keep it out of my radio!! 
 I can still remember it like it was yesterday.  I was probably 10 years old, and I was shopping in Princeton, IN with my parents.  We went into a corner five & dime/drugstore (remember them...weren't they great!), and there was this Bay City Rollers Greatest Hits album.  I persuaded my mom to buy it for me, even though I was not familiar with most of their songs other than "Saturday Night".  At that young age, I had a huge crush on their 4 handsome faces on the album cover.  I took the album home and played it on my Donny & Marie Record Player.  It was pure bliss.  I loved every song.  I took the album to school and played it during music class when we would get to bring in records from home.  My mother being English, I also liked the fact that they were from Scotland.  In a couple of years, they faded from view and were never heard from again.  When I found this CD, I had to buy it to relive those wonderful days of my childhood.  I have played it many times, and I still get a thrill when I hear these songs.  My two favorite songs are the ballad "The Way I Feel Tonight" and the rocking "Yesterday's Hero".    Since this CD was issued, I see that they have released a "Definitive Collection" that includes other songs that were hits overseas before they became successful in the States.  I suppose the diehard fans prefer that collection.  But I prefer this one since it preserves my memories of these 10 classic songs from the 70's as I remember them.  Critics can say what they want, and they can lambast this music for being empty, vapid, bubblegum pop.  But for those of us who loved the Rollers, they can't take away our memories of a simpler time in our lives.  And in the end, isn't that all that matters anyway. 
 WHOSE WEDDING IS IT ANYWAY brings back loveable characters (ie Eloise, Jane, Amanda & Natasha) from Senate's debut novel, SEE JANE DATE.  WWIIA's heroine is Eloise Manfred who's just signed a contract w/her boss for a free $100K wedding to be featured in her employer's magazine "Wow Weddings".  Although, people tell Eloise nothing's for free, she finds out the hard way as she's forced into "choosing" a Big Bird wedding dress, rubber bridesmaids dresses and square wedding rings that her boss insists are perfect for the ultra Modern Wedding spread.  In addition to boss-related wedding disasters, Eloise's impending marriage has her chomping a pack of Tums per day despite having found the perfect man.  During her hilarious and crazy experiences putting together the ultimate Modern Wedding, she's forced to deal with long-ignored and painful family issues that ultimately lead her to the answers about herself and her family that she never knew she always needed.   The characters in WWIIA are heartwarming and real in yet  another fast-paced enjoyable read by Melissa Senate - can't wait to see what she comes out with next 
 I stumbled upon this title last summer while searching Amazon for something interesting to read. Skipping over it at that point for one reason or another, however, I was again recommended this text as a supplement for a Linguistics course in which I am enrolled this fall. This is certainly no textbook in Linguistics, but it does serve as an interesting, easy-to-read work that makes contemporary, Chomsky-driven Linguistics (especially with regard to Universal Grammar and Cognitive Science) highly accessible. Pinker's writing, while sometimes manic and even unclear, still manages to captivate and seize attention easily in the same manner as other recent nonfiction texts (Malcolm Gladwell's are two such examples). With an intended audience of linguistic-laymen readers, Pinker has certainly succeeded in making boring textbook linguistics interesting, in furnishing his text with pertinent examples, and in bringing contemporary linguistics to the masses. As other reviewers have noted, one should remain skeptical and critical of Pinker's proposed theories (as is necessary with all such writing), but I would certainly recommend this text to anyone even slightly interested in the subject 
 This is required reading for anyone who hopes to effectively market to  children.  Unlike professorial/scholarly treatises, this author has  actually been in the trenches, and it shows.  The real world applications  is what puts this book above all others dealing with this topic 
 This is the first of Bob Woodward's Bush war books and it is simply title 'Bush at War.'  I know that Woodward has been bashed by the right as someone out to get George Bush.  I really think that the people that make that accusation have not read these books.  It seemed to be rather fair to Bush and his staff, overall.  It comes off as, in a way, a documentary on what led the US to go after Afghanistan, the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  It goes into the high level meetings...Woodward spent hours interviewing Pres. Bush himself, as well as with Rumsfeld, Powell, Cheney, etc.   There were a couple of things that surprised me and didn't surprise me.  First, Bush comes off much sharper than he is actually given credit for.  Though I don't always agree with his reasoning, he had a strong voice within his administration and he used it.  He would tell them what he wanted and his staff (Rummy, etc.) would get it done.    Second, it was interesting to see how dire it appeared with Afghanistan.  The administration was frustrated, little was being accomplished and winter was about to set in...and then all of a sudden, one of the air raids along with the troops (northern alliance, CIA) moving forward, the Taliban went on the run.  It seemed to surprise the administration how quickly it changed.  Third, the administration knew what it wanted to do...but you can see that there was little big picture planning going on.  Woodward had a great line when he said "The president, untested and untrained in national security, was about to start on the complicated and prolonged road to war without much of a map."  As we have seen, this has dogged Bush for years...we come out with guns blaring and not quite sure where to go when we have done something.    Fourth, you can see how alienated Powell was for almost the entire presidency.  Neither Rumsfeld nor Cheney seemed to want his input much and the President appeared to be more than ready to listen to those two with Powell often being the scapegoat or the one out on his own little island (even though Rice often tried to bring him back in).  It was a good read.  Worth the time and a nice look into an administration.  
 I do not know if I have too much to add to the outstanding reviews of this book on 'Amazon'. by Peter Reeve and B. Mirsky. However my thought is about the mythic element of the story, the creation of the type of the American hero, strong and silent, and of the 'noble savage.' What most effected me was the story of the noble savage, of Uncas, of the 'Last of the Mohicans' of the individual's dying meaning the dying of a people . In one sense this perhaps symbolizes the triumph of 'civilization'. But in another it suggests a great crime and loss.  Cooper as Mark Twain perhaps too hilariously taught us writes awkwardly. But he also has a kind of strength of invention, a freshness of beginning. And that perhaps draws readers to these works in spite of their stylistic and literary defects.   
 A well written and concise book. Geoff Chaplin has the ability to express complex concepts in a clear and lucid manner. One off the most problematic areas of credit is the area of correlation. Geoff does an excellent job of explaining the problems and developing solutions to include conventional solutions from the street.  It is very apparent that Geoff has the practitioner's background to go along with the academic experience.   An excellent teaching tool. Should be a part of anyone's book shelf involved in credit derivatives or with the aspirations of entering that field  
 Although compared to Francine Rivers' Redeeming Love, Allison Pittman's Ten Thousand Charms stands on its own merit. It is a different story. Instead of Hosea and Gomer, it's loosely the story of David and Bathsheba. Pittman's characters are well written and multi-faceted. While I felt one of the conflicts introduced wasn't fully developed, there was enough thrown at Gloria to make the read satisfying. I liked the way Pittman ended the book, leaving the reader to imagine the rest. Pittman has delivered a beautiful picture of how God takes the worst of humanity and washes us clean. A murderer and a prostitute--neither one able to outrun God's amazing grace and love 
 This book explains why so many couples find themselves drowning in marital misery. Dr. Goulston shows couples what they can do to get back the love they once had.  His profound understanding of love relationships obviously comes from a depth of knowledge about the fundamental needs of men and women, needs which are not as different as others might have us believe. Men and woman are, as Dr. Goulston says, "from the same planet" after all. I am not kidding about this book being a manual for marital happiness. That's how I will use it. A truly great book 
 Easy to read - easy to understand There are SO many new concepts to Exchange 2000 - it can be a bit daunting.  I also found an inaccuracy and wrote the author about it, who clarified it immediate.  Impressed me a great deal that he stood behind his material. It also has nice practical walkthroughs, but they require three machines to set up the proper Exchange 2000 environment - which I recommend 
 Now first let me explain something.  I am not pregnant and I have never been pregnant.  I bought this video because I wanted to see what a pregnancy video looked like and that I knew it was going to be gentle, but yet a good workout.    This video was very good.  Kathy Smith is very good in explaining the routines and modifications for the routines.  She has a calming attitude and is very reassuring.  You don't feel threatened by her.    I am overweight and have bad knees so I am using this video to help me to lose my weight in a gentle way without putting a lot of stress on my joints.  It is a good aerobic workout for beginners.  It has three separate aerobic dance routines to it with a warmup in the beginning and then toning exercises followed by relaxation exercises.   One thing I loved about this video was that it was doing the routines to '80s music.  Well I grew up in the 80's era, so it was like a trip down memory lane for me.  I really enjoyed it very much.  I have read other reviewers saying that they hated it because of the music or because she went into detail about taking deep "cleansing" breaths.    I loved the music and the routines were fun and easy to catch on too.  I felt extremely well after my workout and I would continue to use it daily.  I loved it.  And another thing was, all the ladies in the class looked like they were really enjoying it themselves.  One of the ladies cracked me up with how she was really getting into the routines swinging her hips about and everything.  That was very encouraging to know that the participants were having fun in the class, as well as how it made me feel watching them having the fun.  Exercise should be fun and not feeling like you're going to drop over dead exhausted.   What I say to those who commented on negative things, well first off Kathy was only explaining that we all need to "breathe" properly using deep cleansing breathing as what is taught to you in Yoga class.  Deep "cleansing" breaths are vital to our everyday living along with good posture.  Proper breathing is our most valuable thing we can do to our bodies.  It helps to heal our bodies of infection, pain, or whatnot.  I, personally, find it to be extremely healthy now that I know how to "breathe" properly.    I would recommend this workout to anyone pregnant or non-pregnant who would want gentle exercises to do to help them lose weight or just feel good about themselves.  Great job Kathy and all the pictures of the pregnant ladies that were in the video at the end after they had their children were beautiful.  Kathy and your little girl, at that time, was so adorable.  Great video.  I love it dearly. 
 I got this book as a gift and at first was a little intimidated by its size, about 480 pages. I though to myself it takes this many words to tell me how to simplify my life? Then, I realized that there were so many topics covered within the book that it all made sense. There are ways to simplify your finances, all the rooms of your home, your office at work, your relationships, even your level of fitness. The author draws on practical proven age old advise as well as offering quite a bit of innovative suggestions I have not seen anyplace else. This blend of the old and the new makes for a most enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to anyone who owns a house and/or has accumulated a lot of stuff over the years 
 I read this book when a child, and still remember it at age 25. Now, it didn't turn me into a neat person, but with fond memories of this book in my heart, I plan on having a clean room ... one of these days 
 I just can not stop listening to this cd.  I wish these guys made more than just this effort.  It is superb musicianshi 
 "Selma Koch, a Manhattan store owner who earned a national reputation by helping women find the right bra size, mostly through a discerning glance and never with a tape measure, died Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 95 and a 34B."   It may take especially thick skin to find a book on the subject of obituaries anything but depressing and morbid, but for those like me who are pre-disposed to finding such things more entertaining and fascinating than frightening this is an appealing topic. Then again, I'm native to the Deep South, where people go on death watch the minute you pick up the phone to make an appointment for a medical check up. In a culture that lives to bake casseroles in anticipation of disaster, any southern cook worth her salt will have water on to boil the instant Uncle Leroy feels the first chest pain, and by the time he hits the floor will have the casserole sitting on his doorstep.   Marilyn Johnson is a woman obsessed by obituaries, and in The Dead Beat she writes about the good, the bad and the ugly of the genre. What makes a good obituary, what makes a bad one, and how can we tell the difference? Burning questions, all of them, and every one is answered in this book, complete with numerous examples of all sorts of tributes. Some are weepy, some are wonderfully catty and some are just plain pathetic, but what they tell us is the subject of death is morbidly fascinating to us all.   Obituaries can also apparently be informative:   "How about Harold von Braunhut, the genius behind sea monkeys? Sea Monkeys, mail-order packets of brine shrimp, shrimp that could be shipped and shelved in dried form, sprang to life when dropped in water; 400 million of them once shot into space with an astronaut. I learned this on the obits page. War, pestilence, bad investment news, and political rants in sections A through D, but there, on the page marked Obituaries - sea monkeys!"   In the midst of all her rapture on the subject of obituaries, Johnson also realizes there's something somewhat off-kilter about her enthusiasm. It may be encouraging to know she does recognize and address this in the course of the book, "How do I say this? I scare nurses. My children are used to it, but fewer of their friends drop by, I've noticed."   The Dead Beat is, strange as it sounds, a great read for those interested in the off-beat, quirky journalism behind obituaries. As reviewer Lisa Grunwald puts it, "Vital reading for anyone who knows a dead person or is likely to become one."   If this doesn't give you a taste for tuna casserole I frankly don't know what will 
 As all reviewers will attest, this is the hi-octane "real McCoy," a body of work of which dreams are made.  Chuck's famous standards are all here, but delve deeper for lesser-known sides.  Of particular interest are "Tulane" and "Have Mercy Judge," the latter being the conclusion of the story.  A two-part tale of star-crossed lovers busted for selling drugs.  While that might not seem like the hot ticket for a evocative story-song, it is.  "Tulane" is a frenetic rocker while "Have Mercy Judge is pure blues.  Play them back to back to witness rock genius at work 
  What i learned in this story was that you should never judge anything until you try it.Dr.Seuss first puplished "Green eggs and ham" in 1960.This book is about a wierd animal thats called Sam-I- am. This character trys to convince the other animal to try Green egss and ham .He tryes every manner of presentation like in a house, doubter gets tired of sam and decides to try Green eggs and ham.. and guess what ????? he loved Green eggs and ham!!!!!! 
 A very large wealth of information on the rastafarian movement. A very scholarly anthology. Read it three times over and learn more each time! Will use for years 
 Medication is one of the scariest aspects of treating childhood mental illness.  This book provides a wealth of easily understood information.  This is a great book that should be used in combination with other books that help parents handle the other aspects of treating their children's disorders.  Two I recommend for Bipolar Disorder are "If Your Child is Bipolar" and "The Bipolar Child."  The more helpful resources out there the better.  These are books that should definately be on parents' shelves 
 This was the third book I bought at the City LIghts bookstore when I was there in 2005 or so.  It was this one, a book of beat poety and a collection of San Francisco short stories. I read the beat poetry and this memoir at about the same time, which was a good way of doing so, as many of them dovetailed.  I bought it for Joyce, not for Kerouac, as I'm not his biggest fan anyway and have never read On the Road. Was very impressed.  It does a good job of showing the lives of the beats and how they lived and the insanity moments of them. Captured the feel of it. But sad. I liked Elise and Hettie a lot and kinda want to read Hettie's memoir too.  And probably the dudes at some point too.  I like when she's talking about beatnik as a commodification situation.  
 I'd like to say that this is some great controversy here. That old fight over is there God or isn't there God. Well it's so simple ; The thought that there is intelligent design in the universe is realistic. Just take a good look at everything, forget your scientific or religious beliefs. It's simple common sense , God is something that is real but is outside our scope of perspective or comprehension. We are simply complex finite beings and God isn't . We put our knowledge and rules in neat little boxes for future reference. God is pretty much outside of these boxes God's beyond complex . God is sort of like everything. You can faintly see it but can't put your finger on it.(Enough philosophy) Which is to say Schroder has written a fine piece on scientific meta-physics and things of that nature. Recomended to any human with a wooden brain or a stiff simple belief system. Learn to just open your mind and be less humanlike. (less finite 
 First and foremost: I LOVE THIS ALBUM... although is not as good as "New Traditionalist". DEVO went straight into mainstream pop without even notice it. This album is filled with very good songs like "Time Out for Fun", "Out of Sinc" and "Patterns", but one must wonder what went on their heads when they created such blunders like "Speed Racer" or "Explosions". However, this is an album for, well... TIME OUT FOR FUN, so don't waste your time analizing it. Buy this album ASAP if you like 80s pop 
 This landmark film from 1984 is a dark interpretation of the well known fairy tale legend, Red Riding Hood. It's focus is on the splendid settings including the murky and dense forests, the wooden cottages where the villagers live in fear and danger posed by man-like beasts that prowl in the night during the testing Freudian times.   The film is composed of several scenarios where vivid and dreamlike sequences take shape creating a very unusual and altered perception of man's ability to determine and grasp fantasy from reality. Every scene is well done thanks to the execution and film direction by Neil Jordan whose original thinking and imagination has led to a superb adaptation based on Angela Carter's "The Bloody Chamber" book.   The dark, spooky atmosphere in this classic fairy tale re-telling is blessed by the use of ancient folklore and Old Wives tales which hint at casting a spell or curse on anyone who is uncivil to others or society. Angela Lansbury who plays the grandmother spins such stories to a young Rosaleen, a pre-pubescent teenager who is about to go on a journey of self-discovery both emotionally and physically to unravel the hidden delights of adulthood. Despite such tales, the girl is unaffected and her courage takes her to unknown paths through the dark woodlands where her character and judgement will be tested to forecast her values and beliefs she will behold in adulthood. Interactions with unknown strangers, mostly men whose eyebrows meet in the middle lend itself to a powerful experience for the innocent teenager.   In general, this film is more of a fantasy where the excessive blood and gore is barely a feature, and instead the portrayal of genuine, well-mannered men with their hidden devilish, cunning personality is the most threatening aspect and difficult to predict as to when one may strike. As with most modern vampire/werewolf stories, the main attraction that ensures the film's success is the character humour neatly stirred in to give all viewers a general taste and feel of scary and not too scary moments mixed into the plot. Stephen Rea's performance early in the film when he returned home as a filthy, long-haired, smelly hippie after sometime spent outdoors as a wolf had overturned the dining table during an argument - remember the same thing occurred in the 1994 "Interview with the Vampire" movie when a hacked-off silly, bearded, overweight rogue had lost a card game!  As well as the beautifully rendered scenes, the music is well composed which is suspenseful and adds to the eerie, tense atmosphere giving a sense that something is always happening and that there is always darkness and never daylight.  The best thing  about this film was that no one could be trusted and anyone who thought they'd make good friends with someone were sure in for a big surprise! The friendly and seductive but sinister Terence Stamp is an example.  The constant nagging, bickering and annoyance by mainly the women towards their husbands or girls constantly rejecting the sexual advances of seemingly-friendly strangers are leads which drive man's desire and anguish to frighteningly transform into the werewolf at full moon . This was the message the film was sending out in that the men during those times were always the one in charge, and care should be exercised whenever household arguments or disagreements  broke out to prevent the ultimate beast being unleashed  from within himself should the dispute, whatever it may be turn too ugly.  The human-to-werewolf transformation scenes were well filmed and hand-crafted in 1984 and convincing using remote-controlled models for the wolf-like beasts, but compared to today's standards the scenes have shown signs of ageing. However in my opinion, the overuse of today's computer generated images could spoil a horror film making certain scenes look corny or just not believable.   The DVD is presented in a beautiful tin box which reflects the show's class. This is now becoming a rarity, and the DVD is now commonly sold in a standard plastic box which is cheaper if purchased on-line. It is shown in 4:3 aspect ratio but not 16:9 widescreen as stated on the box and a good range of extras especially the expert 90 minute audio commentary available, but very well worth the buy. Apart from the DVD film disc, there is an excellent booklet included detailing events that took place behind the cameras, as well as a history of folklore legend and wild beasts, character descriptions and the actors' biographies in brief, all explained with colourful photographs taken from the film. The running time is 90 minutes, but I felt it should have been a 2 hour-plus epic. It is also rated 18 and suitable for adults only. It is a box of delight and should be treasured forever. For best effect, watch this alone in the dark before bedtime 
 I picked this book up as an assignment for my Popular American Music class, but have found a tremendous amount of admiration for a man who made lemonade out of lemons.  I have learned a lot about a man who led a group of men to great achievements despite their lack of freedom and limited resources.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who appreciates learning about a musician who truly sang for his freedom 
 I use this tangram puzzle with my junior high school students.  They enjoy the challenge very much.  The pieces are nice, solid metal.  The puzzle diagram book could be bigger 
 I read this book when it was first published and I really enjoyed rereading it again when I found a paperback in my hotel room. It is an impressive presentation of what industrial production of food will do to our nation and to the consumers of this so-called food. I highly recommend to all 
 This book is an exciting study that brings together legal and linguistic conceptions of what it meant for people to be "property" under U.S. chattel slavery, and the impact of these conceptions on post-slavery legislation of race relations.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the question of the rape of slave women and the property in resultant children is not addressed.  The author discusses what it might conceivably mean to own a person's labor power, but not what it also means to own her reproductive capacity and the children that resulted, on the one hand, from relations between blacks, and, on the other, relations between white slaveholders and enslaved women.  The study is broad-ranging and provocative, but it would be even stronger if gender were considered somewhere other than in the (admittedly fascinating) discussion of the way certain issues play out in very early films.  
 I think that this production of La Fille du Regiment is very pleasing to both sight and sound.  The props are very bright and vivid, the costumes are eye-catching, and the vocals are stunning.  I like this production because it features fabulous singers other than Sutherland, Callas, Pavarotti, and so on....I think they are tremendous vocalists, but it's nice to see such great operas performed by various, other "qualified" singers.  I would liked to have seen this opera performed with Kathleen Battle (since this is the opera she was working on at the time of her dismissal).  This is the only DVD of this opera that I own and since it could not have been Miss Battle, I am glad I have this one.  Devia and Podles are greatly gifted singers who have a lot to offer and I am sure you will not be let down 
 Dr. Richard Bartlett's life changing book is wonderful!   For those who have already been to his weekend seminars it brings back that wonderful "seminar state." The two-point is explained in such great straightforward detail. Even though I have been two-pointing for quite awhile I enjoyed reading about it. Plus I love his stories! He has also included several stories from his students.   Matrix Energetics can be learned by anyone, in fact children are quick learners. I believe this new book will make it very possible for anyone to start practicing Matrix Energetics after just a few chapters! As one reads further they'll just become more creative in this artform!  Matrix Energetics truly has given me a way to look at life from a new vantage point. It is transformational, healing and fun!  Thank you Dr. Bartlett. You're wonderful teachings will reach and help so many more people now. 
 Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  This product is rich, but at the same time light.  After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn't detect the "cirtus" smell in the product description.  I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size.  
 This is an excellent listing of horror movies to rekindle memories or to suggest what to hire from your video store.  Most horror films are here but not all.  Critters is one of my favourites that is not in this book.  There is a short summary of each film along with a rating and opinion.  Obviously you are not going to agree with all the opinions and ratings.  There are also summaries of different directors who have been influential in the horror genre.  A listing of alternative titles at the back of the book helps you to quickly locate a film, as all films are in alphabetical order if you can not originally find it.  There is also a list of all the actors who have been in horror films and information on what other horror movies they have been in. Photographs from various horror films are also included making this not a bad reference book 
 Classic expose of an mlm business. Amway undoubted has some good things, and many "nice folks" do Amway. However, the business model is impossible. I read once that only one-third of one percent of all amway distributors make any real money. The vast majority lose money. The same could be said for any other mlm. I realize that Amway defenders come out in droves to attack a book like this: so, to critics of this book, have YOU made more money than you've spent in Amway? Has anyone in your meeting, other than the bigshot who runs the meeting? Be honest.. 
 I have now purchased two of these books as for others after receiving one as a gift myself.  This book has all the old standards and anything you can imagine from yesterday and today.   A must-have for every kitchen 
 This book is a good read, no definative plot but some great interaction of characters and interesting subtext.  Worth the read 
 I am a widely-read amateur historian and was familiar with the outlines of the fall of Constantinople.  Crowley sets the stage for the Ottoman conquest and brings to life many details about the long siege, the politics, and the local customs which, in the descriptions of impalement, are not for the faint-hearted.  Crowley seems pro-Byzantine, as I probably am, but by current standards most of those folks were not nice people.  A related book I also found fascinating, that provides important background, is "The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople." It examines the events in the early 13th century, what became the moral bankruptcy of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and the eventual sacking of Constantinople by fellow-Christian crusader armies.  A very sad tale indeed. 
 Thank God for Heather Mac Donald. This is a reporter's reporter. Most reporters fancy that they don't follow the herd, but they do anyway because it never occurs to them their assumptions and premises fit it in with the group-think of the Intellectual Elites: the herd of independent minds.  Mac Donald, on the other hand, goes out into the street and does not use what she sees to force fit into a liberal worldview. A reporter who is a healthy skeptic and does not erase her inner doubts when they offend the gatekeepers of sensitivity: what a novel concept!  Each chapter in this book will make your blood boil. You want to keep turning the page, but you get mentally exhausted from realizing how out of touch with reality the liberal intellectual elites are. And how relatively easy they seem to brainwash urban crowds.  But then, Mac Donald shrewdly observes, social programs that the elites put into place start to fall apart. The ultimate victims are the very people the elites claim to help. It is the upside-down world aspect of what Mac Donald has found on the ground in America that will leave your head spinning.   
 Any book or author that introduces a concept that becomes part of everyone's handicapping arsenal deserves recognition for their genius.  Davidowitz was the first to really publish insights into track bias and it's power.  Other than that concept, this book is full of good ideas across the board.  The revised edition's treatment of pace is good stuff even for those who approach pace more technically like Brohammer.  Davidowitz's work on charts and how to use them to find key races and trip overlays is more gold for serious players. Years after I first read this, I have realized how great this book is for horseplayers.  Davidowitz has covered a difficult array of factors with provoking insight into each and has done a masterful job of explaining how to incoporate into the handicapping puzzle.  
 This is an introductory text, and not at the same level as Yariv's books or Rosencher's Optoelectronics or Chuang's Physics of Optolelectronic Devices, etc. However, holding this book will not break your wrist (like Saleh and Teich's Photonics, another good introductory text) and is on a similar level to Saleh, but not as exhaustive.

 We purchased this right along with our new Sonlight Ultra Microscope.  My 8 year old loved reading this book by himself and we had to look at all the same things as "Greg" as soon as we were done with the book.  As for as the previous reviewer saying this book was sexist, I strongly disagree.  Showing a mother in the kitchen with an apron on or knitting in the living room is now considered sexist?  Greg's mother encourages and educates her child - an honorable thing in any era!!!  Greg's microscope brings his family together and encourages dialoge - I think it will do the same for your family! 
 The New Perspective is a great little book and a very valuable contribution to field of spirituality and consciousness.   More and more people are awakening to the fact that there is more to reality than meets the eye. The physical reality that we perceive with our five senses is only one facet of what is, only one of the views available from the multifaceted prism of perception. Once we begin to explore the whole prism, we become aware that a broader set of rules is operating just beneath the surface of our ordinary reality. We become aware that we create our own reality through our consciousness and, through practice, we become aware that there are ways of navigating such consciousness and of mastering the creation process.  The New Perspective is a book that explores the process of becoming conscious perceivers and creators of ones life, shining light on the rules beneath the surface. The concepts on how to create a better life are explained very simply and effectively through highlighting ten principles/tools that anybody can easily experiment with, with just a little willingness to try something new. There are wonderful little exercises/processes for one to play with in each chapter, so that you can experience these new concepts for yourself, if you so wish.  The book is written in a very personal way by Ron and Denny, a husband and wife team, married for thirty odd years, blessed enough to have been able to share their journey of awakening together from the inception. The book is full of inspiring and very real anecdotes of what living a conscious life means, as Ron and Denny share interesting episodes from their life as a couple, as parents and as individuals on the path. As such the New Perspective is not only interesting and informational, but it is also inspirational. I was feeling a little down in the dumps before reading this book and by the time a got half way through it, I felt back in the driving seat of my life. I was reminded that if I do not like my current creation, I can change it, as I am not a victim of circumstance but a powerful creator. I was reminded that life is a game to play, where, with the right attitude and with a little help from Spirit, we can experience great fun, joy and adventure as we grow into more magnificence and beauty.   Thank you Ron and Denny for bringing forward so well this precious vibration.  
 Ted Kennedy, after consuming numerous alcoholic beverages, leaves a private party with a young lady not his wife.  His wife, you see, is pregnant and is at home back in Massachussetts.    Sen. Kennedy is driving with a suspended license.    A local peace officer wonders if Kennedy's car is lost after seeing it first go one way and then back up and start going a different way. He approaches it on foot.  The car then takes off at a high rate of speed.    Shortly after this, the car drives off of Chappaquiddick Bridge, flips over and lands upside down in 8 feet of water.  Sen. Kennedy exits the vehicle.  The young woman with him does not.    For the next 9 hours, instead of simply calling the police and rescue workers, Sen. Kennedy desperately goes to work on an alibi.    Kennedy confesses the accident to two people, one of whom is his cousin and lawyer, Joseph Gargan.  They press him to report the accident, which he is understandably reluctant to do.  The two men press Kennedy so much, he surprises them by shouting that he will report the accident and then dives into the lake and swims the harbor to the hotel where he was staying.    Taking Kennedy at his word, Gargan and the other man remain on the Island.  In the morning, Gargan is stunned to find Kennedy chatting with friends and getting ready to head for breakfast.    Not only did Kennedy not report the accident, he also took pains to be seen by a hotel staff member late that night and madee a point of asking the man what time it was.    Two fishermen discovered the upside down car next to the bridge that morning, while Kennedy was still feverishly working on his alibi.    To drink and drive is a crime.  To flee the scene of an accident is a crime.  To fail to render aid to someone injured in an accident you caused is a crime.  While sleeping around on your wife is not a crime, it does display poor judgement and a low moral character.    Senator Kennedy did all these things and because he is a Kennedy, he got away with it.  Had you or I gotten drunk and driven off a bridge with someone in the car with us, and we left them to die while we chose not to report the accident and instead tried to invent an alibi, you or I would go to prison.  We are not Kennedys.    The key merit of this book is that it demonstrates how in America today someone with power and influence can engage in criminal conduct and not only never be called to account for their crimes, but can even flourish and sit in position of moral authority over others.
